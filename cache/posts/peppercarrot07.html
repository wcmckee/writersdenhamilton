<p>&quot;Best holidays ever&quot;, the witch shrugged. A group of skeleton warriors charged
at the group of witches. Coriander posed battle ready in the centre. Welding
a buster sword with two hands.</p>
<p>The day after the party Pepper woke late inn the morning. The sky was a bright
blue with a few scatted clouds.
At the front door Pepper and Carrot discovered signals of the mountains, the
forest, and the clouds? The two wondered why security had been activated.
Then Pepper remembered. She had forgotten to disable the security systems and
her party guests had been detained. Pepper and Carrot travelled on the broom
to each of the trapped guests. First they found Saffron who was lifted into
the air with a branch from the ancient tree. The tree laughed as Pepper
apologised to Saffron and released her. She was not impressed.
The next witch that Pepper and Carrot discovered was Coriander. Her leg was
chained to a friendly giant mountain. Along the top soil lay with green grass
sprouting out.
Pepper asked them if they had a good night, besides the light rain.
&quot;Everyone is safe, no harm done, right?&quot;, Pepper asks for forgiveness.
She tells them she has  prepared tea and invite the witches home.
They are annoyed with Pepper but follow her home anyway - they are all
thirsty after a night of being trapped by the security system.
The way the other witches were looking at Pepper was upsetting for her. Pepper
heard them whispering nasty remarks - especially Saffron.
The witches pets wanted to fix this. Together they decided to make
themselves sick, causing Pepper to lead and cure every ones pets. The plan works,
the animals get sick, Pepper cures them. Everyone is happy with Pepper.
One of the side effects of the cure was fur and feather loss. All the animals
are annoyed with Carrot as he didn't tell them this and if he had told them
they would of not gone along with the plan.</p>
<p>Carrot had ran off and Pepper couldn't find him. She was beginning to worry
about her cats safety. It wasn't like him to run off. Pepper tracked Carrot
deep into the forest. She had never been this deep before. Calling Carrots
name Pepper found the cat sleeping on the grass under a rocky cliff.
As Pepper wakes Carrot a shining blue circle light appeared behind them.
Pepper looks around surprised of the magic happening. The light explodes,
revealing a tunnel where the rocks use to be. Pepper and Carrot had to
follow the tunnel.
The tunnel lead to a blue pool of water with several blue flying creatures
hovering above. The leader of the group welcomes them to  the magical fairy
cave. Pepper and Carrot realise that they have discovered fairies.
The fairies grant them a single wish promising anything they desire.
'anything... ...I desire', Pepper wonders. The ideas of what she would wish
for appear in her head. A new hat and wand, a unicorn, a dress, a doll, gold,
wings, or love. These were just a selection of ideas that Pepper thought of.
Pepper started to ask for her wish, &quot;I... I'd like to&quot;, She stumbled.
&quot;uh, what I'd like is that...&quot;, Carrot interrupted Pepper with a tired,
&quot;Meow&quot;. Immediately Carrot collapsed to sleep. Tne fairies announced the
wish had  been granted and disappeared. Pepper was annoyed with Carrot. The
cat had wasted the one wish on asking to go back to sleep.</p>
