<p>Ideas for Hamilton Computer Club</p>
<p>The theme for the site needs to be bootstrap. No side bar, only top.</p>
<p>Logo on the top left. Currently the banner on the top of the screen is
a photography of a motherboard. Hamilton Computer Club is in large white
typography. Exchange information and share skills, is below. Slightly
smaller. A clip art image of a computer is on the right.</p>
