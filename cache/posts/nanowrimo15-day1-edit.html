<p>&quot;This is a great script editor! I am testing this. Hello from the otherside!&quot;.</p>
<p>ITWILLNOTBEMINE</p>
<p>By William Mckee.</p>
<p>This is a novel. First draft was created November 2015. First edit Feb 2016.</p>
<p>The clock struck midnight. The single light bulb in the room flickered. The temputre of the room was cool. The air condition kept it low.</p>
<p>Their hands hovered over the keyboard with a single finger clicking the keys.
Eyes moving back and forward on the screen. The monitor displayed an error dialog box. The private key was broken and had become corrupt. Unable to connect to the server.
Something had changed. A break was needed. Sometimes it was the best option.
They stood up suddenly, with arms reaching out and letting out a sigh. Their head looks around, then focused on the exit. The day had taken a toll on the body.</p>
<p>The jug on as they walked into the room. Tapped thier feet and reaching into their pocket to pull out a phone. A tap of the screen prompted for the password. It was running
a modified kernal version. Their fingers tapped the keys, inputing the code. Tapping the music icon. A list of stations began to scroll. &quot;Oh the choices', they spoke, eyes fixed on the device
'Who are you talking too?', a voice spoke.</p>
<p>Sarah stood at the bottom of her works stairs. She looked up at the exit sign. Rain propaled from the sign. Her hand reached for the handle and bringing it down,
swinging the door open. Before taking a step outside she turned and yelled, 'Are you coming?'.</p>
<p>'One moment, cleaning up', a voice mutted from above. The man sat hunched over a keyboard and monitor. His fingers flicked quickly over
the keys. He was in a hurry and now had Sarah waiting for him. The monitor displayed a dialog box: status complete. A smile rose on his face. 'Joey has done it', he spoke.
Joey ripped out the USB from the hub and lepping up from the chair. He scrambled down the stairs towards Sarah 'Sorry about that,
he apoligised to Sarah. She was still holding the door open. 'Did it work?', she asked. Joey noded as they both stepped into the rain,
the door locking after them.</p>
<p>The sky turned black. Locking arms they walked the street together. The street was deserted. Abanand cars, fallen light poles, the orcasinal dead body.
Sirens scretched in the distance. 'Do you think they are coming for us?' asked Joey. &quot;There are bigger problems for them to
deal with. They are certainly not', Sarah replied. 'careful, watch your step', she added. A toppled burning building lay in their path. They carefully manovered
the rubble. 'Not much further', Joey spoke. 'It's just around this corner'. The path twisted and the two turned into a narrow alleyway. They walked
past several abanded building before reaching a great big red door which read: Number 6 TechFuncMasters.</p>
<p>'This is it', Sarah wispered. She raised her hand and gave two solid knocked on the door. Movement could be heard inside, the sound growing louder.
'Who goes there?', the voice inside spoke. 'Sarah and Joey', spoke sarah. The door crecked open. A man in his mid 40 stood.in front of them. He was
tall - 6 foot 5 with a long brown beard and blue eyes. His head was saved. He wore circal glasses. ' i am Uganka ', he spoke in a eastern european
accent. He held his hand out and shook both Joeys, followed by Sarahs hands. 'it is nice to meet you finally ', Joey said as he shook Uganka's
hand with a strong grip. 'Please come in out of this rain', Uganka greeted them into the building. The two stepped into the door. 'Please follow me',
Uganka spoke as he started to was down the hall way. Saray and Joey followed the man, arms still linked together.</p>
<p>They reached the end of the hall and stopped at a steel door. Uganka stopped. ' Is something wrong? ', Sarah asked. 'This is your last chance to leave',
spoke. Uganka. 'ther is no turning back from here'. 'no we wnt to do this', both Joey and Sarah spoke. 'very well', uganka spoke as he unlocked the
steel door. They walked into a room that was pitch black. Sarah grabbed Joeys arm in fear. Ã­ts ok, joey wispered.  The steel door behind them slammed
shut and they both jumped. Purple and red lazers starting wizzing around. 'Where is Uganka', asked Joey. The man that had lead them into the room
was gone. A wizzing noice started. Growing louder, andd louder. Sarah and Joey let go of each other and held their hands to their ears. Along with
the wizzing sound increasing a new sound began - sirens. The two dropped to the ground. Sarah was the first to screem and started moving in a
circle motionon the ground. Joey started screaming shortly afterwards.  The sound was deafening. Suddently the room flashed with lightning as the noise
stoppeed. The room returned to norma lighting, but the room was empty. Both Sarah and Joey had vanished.</p>
<p>The single light bulb in the room flickered. Antoney lay back on his chair. His left monitor had the latest episode of a telvison show. The central monitor had a web browser
open with a IPython Notebook running. The right monitor had test results being displayed. Three terminal windows,
all displayed results of his code changes. Smaller security camera displays hovered above the monitors. These cameras were spread throughout the rooms in the building
and surrounding areas. The feed was tapped into the cities traffic cameras and a realtime feed of the surounding streets. A quick exit would be posible in case of any trouble.</p>
<p>'Alert - inruder in section 31', the monitor displayed a large flashing dialog box on his currently viewing screen. The eye inplunts allowed the system to track movement and focus, making smart interface decisions.
Glancing up from the television show to the cctv monitors. 'switch to room 18', he spoke.
Thee monitor zoomed in on a camera in room 18. 'That's strange', antoney pondered. The room looked normal. 'Maybe I need to check it out
myself', he rose from his chair and started walking towards the steel door. He unlocked it and walked through. The room was pitch black. 'Somethings
wrong', he spoke. 'This can't be happening'. The lights switched on and everything seemed normal.</p>
<p>Antoney caucioly walked through the room heading toward room 18. He peaked around the hallway corner. Empty. He started walking down the hallway.
A womans screem and frooze. 'Who's there', he yelled. Now he knew there was an inruder. He reached for his handgun.
He was ready. 'I have a gun', he warned. walking towards the screams. He reached the door. The
letters 18 read on it. &quot;I'm going to enter&quot;, he warned. Gun drawn he busted through the door.</p>
<p>The woman lay in the center of the floor. She was shivering, naked and covered in blood.
&quot;Who are you?&quot;, Antony crepts towards the woman. How did you get in here?&quot; He
lowered his weapon. She was no harm. Her screams had stopped.
&quot;Sarah&quot;, she told him. She leapt from the ground. and wrapped her body around Antony. He was startled at the movement. a little shocked to have this woman suddenly
over him. In his arms she sobd. 'now,  now, he spoke, pating him on the back. he gently pushed her off him, moving her to an office seat.
'lets find you a blanket', he said. He spots a rugs that he wraps around you.
'How did you get here', Antony asks Sarah. Still shacking she repied with, 'The last thing I remember is purple and red lights'.
'hmm, interesting', spoke Antony. 'What is todays date?', asks Antony. 'The date..', Sarah pauses. 'It is November 21st 2065'.
Antonys draw drops. 'You believe the year is 2065?'. Sarah gives him a confused look. 'Sarah, it's the year 3532'.</p>
<p>Antony switched on the jug and began making a coffee. As he poured the water a voice apeared from behind him.</p>
<p>The keys S.T.A.R.T.S.Y.S.T.E.M. was typed onto the machine. Return. The main led light switched to green. A wirling sound began as the machine
started up. He fixed his glasses as he nervously waited for the boot. Tests had passed, but now it was the real deal. The bios
had finished loading and the machine was booting the kernal. The most progress the machine had ever done. Scientists and developers
had worked for 30 years to develop this machine. The room was airgapped and blocked all signals. This was to stop interference from
any 3rd party. Attempts had been made to modify the machine. The machine was on the 10th floor of the building.
inside another building. Large fenced surrounded each of the builds with turrets to shoot anything that moved.
It was not posible for anyone to reach the machine. Even the machine being controling wasn't the real. It was sending signals to the real machine.
If the fake machine was comporomised then the true machine would still be safe. The system had successfully booted. The text 6b345 was displayed on
screen. He squinted at the text, knowing it was would be special.</p>
<p>The handed on the clock ticked over to three thiry two. LED lights on the panel displayed the year November 21st 2065. Twenty percent of the time
the machine got the time collabration correct but from time to time an error accured.</p>
<p>He stood in front of the crowd. A grin on his face and a laptop under his arm. The television show had just won awards for the best
Drama and an award for best actor. He didn't feel much like an actor. He waved as the crowd cheered. Cameras flashed as he bowed.
One of his security whispered into his ear, 'Sir, we need to move'. He nodded and waved to the crowd before exiting the stage.
He marched towards the steel door with security following behind.</p>
<p>The room inside the steel door was bright. Monitors filled the desks. Wirling sounds rose from the computers. The machine
began to speak. 'Command Speak'.
Joey steared in amazment. It was miminicing his commands. 'open gimp', he spoke. 'Opening gimp', the machine replied.</p>
<p>She steered at her computer her eyes flicking around the display.  The text, &quot;I'M GOING TO COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND MURDER
YOUR FAMILY', apeared on . 'Another death threat', she sighed to herself. This was forwarded onto the cyber crime devision to investage.
She had been getting these increasingly since she became a moduratier.</p>
<p>The job was boring. She sat at a desk and contacted clients, attempting to sell antivirus software. The software
was spyware. Clients that installed the software had data stolen. The software was closed and It was closed source so no one was able to know what the</p>
<p>She partically liked to ban developers that attempted to produce artwork. If she a office telemarketer wasnt able to draw she didnt want to
let developers draw.</p>
<p>ArtControl had started painting people on RedditGetsDrawn before she was even born. Why did ItWillBeMine take over the subreddit?
What could be done instead. Allow all artists. There is no such thing as troll artwork.</p>
<p>ArtControl had been partically annoying for her. They had developed a script to create a new account for every piece of artwork they created
- submitted. They did alot of artwork - sometimes up to 30 pieces a day. That is up to 30 accounts her and other mods needed to find everyday
and ban. The script caused the artwork to be sent via message to the original poster, along a with mod mail. The art was uploaded to several
different places - but all redirect to artcontrol. This meant when they tried to ban a certain domain the artwork had been uploaded</p>
<p>ArtControl developed the machine to create and submit artwork to RedditGetsDrawn. They had grown tired of painting everyday but still wanted
to create art for the people of RedditGetsDrawn. The machine would look at all the reference images uploaded to GetDrawn via the api. It then
choice the best reference to draw. The machine painted the same way as ArtControl painted - it started the a white landscape document and
added a line layer, followed by grayscale and finally colour. The AI of the machine was able to match up the reference with the history of
ArtControls paintings, creating a unique pience of artwork in the same style as ArtControl.</p>
<p>It was a hot summer day on in Florida. St Andrews High School had just finished morning tea and the students were taking their streets.
Sirens approched the school. Swat team burst into classroom 14. 'Get on the ground', yelled an officer. The students and tutor scremed
and dropped to the ground. 'Which one is Vanessa May?', an officer asked the teacher. 9 officers cicled the students. They didn't seem
interested in the teacher. 'I am Vanessa', a quiet voice raised from the back. Offices moved to the back. Four officers stood over the
girl, who was trembling. 'Vanessa, you are under arrest', the lead officer said as another officer culfed the girl. 'Anything you say
may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attnery, if you cant afford one then one will be apointed for you,'
Do you understand', the lead officer told her. Vanessa nodded.</p>
<p>The officers escorted Vanessa out of the school building. The class stared at her as she exited the room.</p>
<p>'Class is dismissed', announced the computer. 'Be sure to have the reports ready for the next class on ArtControl: The Machine of Art'.
The robatic student stood up imediatly and walked out of the room in single file. 'Confiumed Master. Goodbye', the students spoke as they
exited the room.</p>
<p>Where you are going there are no roads.</p>
<p>She was at home when the private number ring. She had just banned five troll accounts. They had hired a programmer
to write a script that searched for art submissions that used common colours of the troll. They wanted to match its style but it was becoming
difficut. She needed to find the machine that was used to create the paintings. If she could get the machine, she would stop the posts.</p>
<p>Trolls had been posting artwork on RedditGetsDrawn for over 30 years. Some were famous and loved. She considered his
work troll art. It had devoited their life to creating software and hardware for the progression of art. It started small, creating
small scripts,  to building a fully automated machines (that would mimic painting styles).</p>
<p>Slowly climbing out of her seat she moved towards the ringing. Over the years she had grown fat. A combonation of poor diet and laziness. and spending too much time sitting down.
She never walked, and rarely went outside. Her exhusband would pick her up for work daily.</p>
<p>Her husband - Micheal grown tired of her
laziness and bad attatute and left her for another woman. He was much happier, but still saw her during the week when she picked
her up for work and dropped her off at home afterwards.</p>
<p>They split custoly of their daughter - she would 7 days at her monthers, followed by 7 days at her fathers. At the start of the sepration
Micheal got the majority of the time. She only spent every second weekend at her Mothers as the court decided she was unfit for a split
cusoley.</p>
<p>ItWillBeMine picked the phone up before the final ring. It had been setup to disconet the call if the phone was answered at the wrong
time. 'Hello', she spoke into the speaker. 'ItWillBeMine', a males voice replied. 'Yes, Who is this?', asked ItWillBeMine.
'This is dective Hans Lonery, I'm afaird to enforme you that we have your daughter. We need you to come down to the station'.</p>
<p>Art hold secret symbolism for a secret cult.</p>
<p>The artwork produced by the Machine was in being used to encrupt documents from the goverment. It allowed private keys to be created out
of artwork. The holder of public keys were able to recreate the artwork with their own ArtControl machine that was a copy of the original.
The hashes were matched to make sure none</p>
<p>Have something change, one mistake changes the future.</p>
<p>ArtControls light switched from red to green as it started to power up. It loaded the bios from the memory card. In its old system the bios
caused a mafanction which meant the kernal failed to load. The new bios had been original developed by Joey and Sarah. The system was open
source and has recieved contrubitions from thousands of people.
The system was originally developed to create artwork in the style of an artist. After the artist passed away they named the system after him.
The machine still creates artwork in the style of the artist but its system had been developed much further to do other tasks.
They were being created and trained in schools to in order to create a better future today.</p>
<p>Humans had started using ArtControl machines in space in order to explore areas that were too dangerous for humans. They were equipted with a
camera that took high res images - 160000 by 8000 pixels. The machines were able to paint scenes that could not be photographed.
NASA had order 1.3 million units that were to be sent to different areas.</p>
