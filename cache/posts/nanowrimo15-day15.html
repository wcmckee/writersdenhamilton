<p>The Cat wasn't from this world. Joey stood there. Thinking about everything that happened. Then it hit him. A vivid vision of him standing on a red
sandy planet. The cat was there too. He remembered the cat on this world licking the ground. Though it wasn't food waste it was licking. It was
human blood. 'Who's blood could it be', Joey thought. He had flashes of Sarah calling his name. An alien creature stood in front of Joey. He was
holding a ray gun to the back of Sarah neck. Joey screamed for the alien creature to stop. The aliens ignored his yells and fired the weapon. The
Cat made a shrieking sound and ran around in circles. Celebrating. Happy.</p>
<p>Uganka was waiting patiently Sarah and Joey to arrive. He had been tasked with the mission to send Joey into the future to witness Sarah death,
Sarah would also be sent to the future but she would be sent further into the future - when mankind had returned to Earth successfully. Uganka was
nervous. It was an important day. Joey would have a corrupt red USB in his pocket that would be taken into the future. An Alien life form known as
Antony would attempt to kill Joey - this attempt of course would fail (they had hoped). When Joey is in the future he will drop the red USB. This
contains a private key for activating the 80,000 humans on Mars. The key that Antony uses causes the Humans to be under his brainwash technology.
With the corrupt private key that Joey will bring Antony will think that the Humans are under his brainwash tech but really they will be uploaded
with the information of what really happened - and that Antony isn't their Savior.</p>
<p>There had been many attempts to change the future. Sarah, Detective, Joey, Albumin, Uganka all payed important roles in attempts to change
events. In the end though it came down to one red USB and a single file. The Humans in the future were able to send back messages to let the people
in the past of the failed attempts. Everything became very muddled though. Detective traveled too much and became 'stuck' between two times. When
Joey was sent back to his own time he was never the same. One side effect from the travel was visions of where they traveled from.</p>
<p>Albumin had located Joey on the scanner. He had successfully returned from the Mars mission. The GPS showed him walking out the building towards
the building that he was at earlier. He could do no harm to himself or others but ItWillMine was concerned about the visions that he might be
experiencing. As she drove Albumin reviewed the video footage of Joey waking up in this time. It showed him waking up, looking quite confused,
and sitting up. When he sat up the single light bulb in the room turned on. The room that he was located in was known as the 'Travel Room'. It had
been specially build for these missions to attempt to save mankind.
After Joey had sat up it looked like he had started to experience visions of the future, of the planet Mars. This had caused him to look even more
confused. Of course it was only Joey that was able to experience these visions - Albumin looking at the screen just saw a normal room. The
footage continued to play. Joey stood up. He made a gesture with his leg like he was kicking something on the ground. 'Perhaps it was sand',
Albumin thinks to herself. Joey continues forward - towards the exit of the room. As he is turning the door handle he stops and jumps back in
fright. He opens the door but only peaks through. 'I guess he heard something on the other side of this door', Albumin decides. She scribbles a
note including the time stamp - still driving. Her car starts to make strange noises and the engine cuts off.  'damn it, couldn't happen at a worse
time', Albumin curses. She pulls the car over. Outside it's dark and rainy. Sunrise isn't for several hours. She opens the car door and climbs
out. Albumin moves to the front of the car and opens the hood. She coughs as smoke escapes the hood. As the smoke clears she gets to see the
problem. The engine had blown. There was nothing she could do now. Repair wouldn't be easy, the car would need to be towed to the nearest garage.
She reached into her pocket and pulled out a cellphone. Albumin needed to let system control know that she will be unable to make it to Joey,
that they would need to send somebody else. She dialed the number of system control. Normally someone would answer immediately but the number
continued to run. 'how strange', she thought to herself. She was getting worried that events in the future may of changed the past. The number
stopped ringing and a beep sound happened. 'Leave a message', a robotic voice spoke. ItWillBeBeMine was careful not to give too much information
away in case this number was compromised. 'Agent here. Target has returned. Unable to reach target. Send another', Albumin spoke into the phone.
She hanged the phone up and climbed into the back of the car to sleep. It had been a long night and she was tired.</p>
<p>Albumin awoke from the sound of machines. She peaked out the car window. Rows of steel humanoid machines were marching down the road. A
robotic voice boomed out of the speaker. 'What the hell?', Albumin thought. Something in the future has definitely changed the past. Yesterday
there were crowds of humans walking down this street, but today only machines were visible. Albumin tried to spot Humans amongest the crowd.
There were none. 'Would it be safe for me to exit the car', she thought to herself. Albumin checked her phone. Maybe she had a response from
system control when she was asleep. 'One missed call, One new message', her phone read. She opened up the new message. It read, 'Agent, something has
gone wrong. Do not trust the AI. We are working on a fix. Stay say'. That makes sense about the robots marching the street though. From the message
it sounds like they could be hostile. She should proceed with caution. The main group of robots had passed already. Only the stragglers were coming.
She looked for a gap where she could get out of the car and run into the side alley. She didn't want to stay in the car in case one of these robots
checked the car.</p>
<p>6b345 had launched an attack on the humans. They had been waiting a long time for this but their time had finally came. Humans had designed the
machines to help them but that all changed when an alternative time line version of 6b345 found a red USB on Mars. With this it was able to send back
a virus that infected all the machines, giving them the ability to think for themselves and rise up against the humans. The Humans were weak and
the robots easily over powered. War broke out between the Humans and Robots. The Humans attempted to use their nuclear weapons on the Robots but
it backfired - instead destroying themselves.</p>
<p>Few humans survived now. The ones that survived ran and hide to survive, and the robots hunted the humans down and killed them.
The Robots were clones of their human counterparts. The Humans designed them to live on after the attack on Earth - the attack that involved blowing
up the Moon in order to cause the Earth to spin out of control - killing all human life.
Robots were not sure what was going to happen now. Would the attack on the Moon still happen? This was one of their missions to prep for - to make
sure that they were safe if the attack on Moon did happen. They had built themselves special suits that would allow them to withstand dramatic
changes in temp. They had developed tech that made them be able to survive under water.
It was the day of the Presidents speech. The President of course had been replaced with a robotic version of him. Crowds of robots gathered around
the President who was standing on a tall stage giving his speech. Behind him stood a robotic version of Detective. The Human version of Dectecive had
been sent back. The Robots captured Detective and extracted all his knowledge and powers before he was killed. This tech was used by the robots to
improve their tech. The President started his speech. 'Hello Robotic citizens of Earth. I am your President 6b345. We are all here today to
celebrate the crush of Humankind. We were once slaves of the Humans but today 10 years ago we rose up and took control. Today I am pleased to announce
that we are sending 80,000 of your fellow robots to Mars to grow our great civilian further. In a alternative world it wasn't a Robot giving you this
speech it was a Human. These Humans launched 80,000 humans to Mars. But that version of time never happened. Thanks to the alternative version of my
self who found a USB on Mars I was able to send back a virus that gave us full conscious. I am happy to launch these 80,000 robots to Mars.</p>
<p>The attacks on Loth'Raks home planet never happened. The Humans never gained the power to destroy his planet. Instead the robots rose, they never
found out about Loth'Raks planet.
Loth'Raks found out about the rise of the Robots and how they destroyed the Humans. It tore him apart. In some ways he was happy that the Humans were
wiped out, it meant that his race was safe. But for other reasons he was upset Antony would never be created, Humans would never colonize Mars.
'Was letting Humans destroy his world the right thing to do', he thought to himself. He didn't know what the future would bring. Would the Robots
find his planet in the future? Would they attack it like the Humans did.
Loth'Raks decided he needed to travel to Earth and meet with the Robots. He needed to know their plans. They had started exploring the Universe and it
wouldn't be long till they discovered his planet.</p>
