<p>This year is the first year that the conference is 3
full days. In the past its been just the Saturday
and Sunday. Though I believe in the past they have
had tuturials on the friday.</p>
<p>I've taken a look at the talks. I need to decide on what
track to go to - 1 or 2.
Things I'll mostly be interested in hearing about:
Web Development. API, static blogs, design.
robotics. Raspberry Pi.
Education.</p>
<p>I am less interested in database and cloud related topics.
Things like Openstack.</p>
<p>I am planning to work on Nikola on the Friday. In the
afternoon there are  beginner tuturials, and sprints.</p>
<p>There was a call on the mailing list for people to give a
interest of any topics to sprint on.
There was mention of pip,
and my Nikola.
The creator of Nikola Roberia even expressed interest to
me on Twitter that he may be advable for hours/day if it
goes ahead.
I'd like to see it happen. I will be working on it and
encourage others to join me.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what types of people I would get. Some
may be experts with static blogs. Others may never of
heard of them.
I'll be willing to help people in getting started with
Nikola, but the best thing to do is read the site and
use it before the spring.</p>

<p>In November there is the NaNoWrite. Write 50,000
word novel. 2014 was the first year I attempted this.
I'd like to write a self biologey. Or maybe a autobiography
on someone.
My best friend Peter could be interesting to write 50,000
words about.
It might be better to take his character and write it
into a fiction character</p>
<p>Currently sitting in Auckland airport. I have my boarding
pass and just waiting to board. It's an overcast day, but
it's not raining suprisinly.
When I first arrived I had a panic attack and went through
the security without getting my boarding pass. As soon as
I was through security I relized my mistake and went back
to collect my boarding pass.</p>
<p>Currently I am on flight to christchurch. The
takeoff was smooth and I have an excellent window
view of New Zealand. Just experienced a little
turtalence but it was minor. The flight is only
going to take an hour. We are above the clouds and
looking down all I can see is ocean and some
coastline. I was sitting at the wrong gate - I
thought it was gate 30, but
but turns out it was gate 21. I noticed when someone else
was asking about Jetstar and they were redirected.
I quickly packed my Pi up and headed to the correct gate.
I was one of the last thoough the gate but I wasn't late.
There is no free food or drink on this flight.
I have a bottle of water and two sandwhichs. They are in my
bag though which is in the overhead lockers. Once I land
in Chch I will put on warm clothes, eat my food.
I then need
The food and drink service has just closed - we have
almost arrived in chch.</p>
<p>In Python related news the third and final keynote has
been announced - Alison ? who works for Dropbox.
This means that there is three female keynote speakers
at KiwiPyCon. This has to be a first.
It's great there is such a large number but I do hope they
are not keyspeakers just because they are female.</p>
<p>Katie comes from a education background so the talk will
likely not be very techniqaual. Lets hope it's not wishy
washly.</p>
<p>Once they announce trays up I'm going to switch off the pi
and pack it into my laptop bag.</p>
<p>The flight is almost over. It was a smooth flight but my
stomach is a bit sore.</p>
<p>The mountains have snow on them. It is very mountionous.
This has to be the south island.</p>
<p>Sadly I left my camera at home. I guess it's one thing
I won't lose.</p>
<p>The plane is almost completely full - I'm at the back row
(30) and there is no one in the five seats beside me. '</p>
<p>Time to shutdown. Till we arrive.</p>
