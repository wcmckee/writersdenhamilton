<p>so i have registered for wikieducator. It offers free elearning resources. I am enjoying editing and adding content. Areas that I was interested in
adding resources were tech, digital citizenship, art. Conferences and Events. I came accross a course from Otago Politechnic on Tourism and Travel.
I felt I could contrubite to the resources on conferences. It's always safe to add links. I included a few links - to AV recording talk and to
lanyrd - the site that lists confererces and events. I added some education resources on AV setups at conferences and expanded the section on goodie
bags.</p>
