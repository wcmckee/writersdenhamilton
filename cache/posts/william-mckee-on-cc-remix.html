William is a supporter, user, and developer of
open source software and hardware. He is passionate
about early childhood education having volunteered for</p>
<p>&quot;Creative Commons is useful to an artist to promote
the work and it makes the world a better place,&quot; says
William. &quot;Others may find uses for my art
and even make money from it, good on them!&quot;</p>
<p>During High School William spent the majority
of his senior years in the Design room. Spenting the majority of his time creating vector
designs.</p>
<p>William became interested in
drawing after leaving high school and
attending UCOL in Palmerston North.
There he had a drawing tutor, Mark,
who inspired him to keep a drawing journal.
William gained the habit of carrying a
sketchbook wherever
he goes, along with a pencil or pen.</p>
<p>William created the site artcontrol.me:
The Art Of William Mckee.</p>
<p>The site was created for a home for William
to host his artwork.</p>
<p>Originally powered by WordPress, he has since
switched to the Python static website
generator - Nikola. This powers his various sites.</p>
<p>It was hosted with GoDaddy and ran CentOS. The site was powered by WordPress,
switching later to Nikola.
He later also switched this to DigitalOcean
with the operating system Debian, which is
used by the majority of his machines.</p>
<p>Well William was always interested in using
a Creative Commons licence, he at first
chose to use a more restrictive
Attribution-NonCommercial (BY-NC) licence
for his artworks, though soon chose to use
the liberal Attribution (BY) licence.
William doesn't see many reasons for artists
to use NC licences, and finds it especially
problematic when NC licensing is used by
governments.</p>
<p>As William argues, &quot;Tax payers have already
paid for the material. It should therefore be licensed under the most liberal licences
(perhaps even public domain/creativecommons
zero). This allows the most freedom for
people to do what they like with the content.&quot;</p>
<p>I like the idea of aribution. Everyone should be
licencing their copyright work under a Create Commons Attribution licence or
zero.</p>
<p>William also point out that the
&quot;Non-Commercial licences are hard to
interpret, as was noted in a German court
case in 2014, which strongly limited the
interpretation of NC to 'personal use.'
Similar problems with the interpretation
of NC could exist in other countries.
This is why I think everyone should avoid
the NC licence. I would actually prefer that
the NC licence not exist in the first place.&quot;</p>
<p>The good thing, Williams says, is that the
majority of New Zealand government works
released under CC seems to be under CC BY,
though he is concerned that some schools
seem to have adopted an NC licence.</p>
<p>In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended
The Learning Connexion, where he began to
focus on life drawing. This was created on
brown paper with an easel. Pencil, coloured
pencil, oil pastel, acrylic paint, gouche,
watercolours were the media that he used.</p>
<p>William had done digital painting since
attending UCOL with illustration classes.
He used a Wacon tablet. Currently for his
digital painting William uses an Intous 5
small tablet connected to a Raspberry Pi
computer. The software he uses is GIMP 2.8
and it is running the operating system
Rasbian (Debian Jessie, Stable). William uses
a batery pack plugged into the Pi to power it.</p>
<p>William uses the Pi to edit text. Plugging
in a keyboard and uses terminal with the
softwarenano to edit text.</p>
<p>Digial later focused on portraits</p>
<p>using GIMP, an free and open source
raster graphics software. William began by
painting on a windows desktop and laptop,
later switching to Fedora and Debian.</p>
<p>Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait
and figures were drawn from references on
RedditGetsDrawn. During this period,
William would draw portraits of people and
give them the drawing - taking a photo for
his own reference.
At the bottom of the page he would sign
with wcmckee artcontrol.me and write 'cc by'
on the piece of original artwork.
These were mostly completely in pencil
and coloured pencil.</p>
<p>William is also passionate about working
with children. In 2014 he volunteered at
Whaihanga Early Learning Centre,
where he would work collaboratively with
kids, often on the same piece of art,
using oil pastel, pencil, and coloured
pencil.
He was influenced by the children's artwork
- often redrawing elements of their works.</p>
<p>William took the liberty of licensing these
works under a CC BY licence - photographing
and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me.
He would create large chalk murals on the
ground outside, with children requested that
he draw comic book characters like the Hulk,
Spiderman, Bane, and Batman. These mural
pieces were created on the fenceline of
Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School.
Swarms of school children would crowd the
fenceline - watching and discussing the
artwork with him. They were blown away
from how quickly he worked and the
quality of his artwork.</p>
<p>&quot;A hope of mine,&quot; William says,
&quot;was the children would learn that art was
about sharing and remixing - something
Creative Commons has at its core.&quot;</p>
<p>William has since become a volunteer for
Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand,
helping to spread the word about
Creative Commons licensing in
the Hamilton region.
