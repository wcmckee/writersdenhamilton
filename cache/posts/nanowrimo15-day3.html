<p>Joey watched as crowds of people hoovered the morning tea table. The food was sweet fresh cream buns and savery muffins. He scanned the area for an
exit. This was too many people for him to handle. He noticed a door leading to a balconey on the far side of the room. He would have to make
his way through several grouups of people. He took a deep breath and procided to walk towards the door. One step in front of another.
'excuse me', he spoke as he made his way past the group.
He finally reached the door and squeesed through the part opening.
Outside on the balconey he felt better. The room felt crowded but out here there was room. The sun was shinning and Joey was able to find a seat
and started to eat his cream bun.
techfuncmasters was the company hosting the conference. It was a three day event where business and technqiue people from a range of companies
got together and shared and collabrated on ideas. The name of the conference was api days.
Joey was a contracter and had just started a new project of developing some addons for gimp. The addons that he had to build was to make it
posible to give the computer a collection of digital paintings, and the video process of the paintings - and a blank canvas. The computer
would then mimic the original painting - creating a new painting with help from a new reference image. Joey wasn't sure who he was creating
this software for - but it didn't really matter. The main thing for joey was that he was getting paid well - and that the addons would be
open source.</p>
<p>Joey heard steps behind him. He was no longer alone out there. A woman in her 20s approched and sat near him. She too had came outside to eat
the morning tea. Joey checked her name tag. Vanessa May, TechFuncMasters, Developer, it read.
'Hi there', spoke Joey after he finished the mouthful of cream bun.
'Hi, How are are', Vanessa replied. 'I'm great, enjoying the conference, some great keynotes. I'm Joey'. Joey shock Vanessas hand.
'Vanessa', she replied.</p>
<p>Antony watched as Joey and Vanessa meet. It was as predicted. History had told that these two would meet this day. October 14th 2065 at
10:50am. Antony knew his job was done and started to walk out of the building. The place was crowded as he started to push his way to the
exit.
'sir, wait', he heard a voice behind him. He ignored it. It was important that he got out of the building in the next 5 minutes. He kept
moving, at a faster pace. 'STOP', the voice yelled. Antony started to run. The last thing he remembers is a buzzing sound. Then darkness.</p>
<p>'So where do you work', Vanessa asked Joey. His badge read Joey McFurson. The company line was blank. His role was set to Developer.
'Oh i am doing some contract work currently. Mostly image maniplation kind of stuff', Joey replied.</p>
<p>The light flickered as Antony opened his eyes. He was strapped to a chair. His mouth gagged to stop him from yelling. The room was small.
A table was in front of him along with a similar chair. On the table was a bunch of medical and electrical devices.
'What the hell', he thought to himself. He heard a door open. In walked a solid built man in his 40s. He had long black hair, brown eyes,
and walked with a slight limp. The man sat down in front of Antony. 'I am Detective</p>
