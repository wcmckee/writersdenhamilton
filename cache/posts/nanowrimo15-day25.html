<p>This was a massive journey for many of the characters. Detective was one of the
main characters. He started off just as a character that Albumin that
interacts with Vanessa when she is arrested at school. Ended up using the
name Detective for a range of events - developing into a full
character. I hope the place goes like a winner. If this is going to be
the end then he needed to make the most of it.</p>
<p>Antony knew that Vanessa would be on the way. She would of reviewed
the security tapes and be attempting to locate with the gps. That was
the only way she would do it. She would come alone with Joey back at
the station as support for the mission. It was highly likely that she
wouldn't drive her ship near out of fear that Antony would spot
it. Antony knew of booster packs that Vanessa might be using on the
mission. After all she was a smart cookie, being able to track him
down. Antony had a plan to make it so that when Vanessa showed up at
the ship to get him, she wasn't going to be able to find him. Antony
had found a way to hop between multiply time lines. He had gained much
skill at it. By focusing he was able to move himself from one time line
to another. He had one problem though he had planned to return to the
other time line but was having problems with attempting to do so. It
seemed that one of the character - Joey posed an ability to hamper
Antony's power useless. He was unable to cross the time line and get
back. Antony had attempted to warn himself - his past self about the
dangers that were about to unfold with his plan. It had all been
unsuccessful. Everything he did couldn't change the past. It annoyed
him so much. He went into a rage and tore apart the world. His anger
destroyed the planet.</p>
<p>As Antony's ship drifted through Space he blasted classical music and
danced around the ship. Detective was tied to the chair when his is
happening. The scene switched to Antony dancing around the ship by
himself and to another scene of Antony and Vanessa dancing around a
hallway. Everyone is human. Antony still has his his human form.</p>
<p>Fascinated by this scene of still having human form Antony dreamed for
this future. What he had was a future where he would become stuck in
his Alien form forever. Antony had many reasons to change the past one
of them being this other time line of him in human form. He dreamed of an
alternative world where he still had his Alien form. Antony would do
anything to get the form back. There comes a point when Antony gets
his form back. Becomes very powerful. Has form when he is a child on
Earth. Loses form when he travels to Mars. Sarah and 6b345 are the
first to see Antony once he has left Mars. The tests on Detective had
came back very strange. It seemed like much of the substance that was
injected into his system was removed when he used the time split
device. It seemed when Detective was in the past that someone - likely
humans found out about what was inside and extracted some of the
substance. That explains the time line changes to the future - one
event changed the future for humans so that their technology grew much
quicker - it was thanks to sending Detective back. If he isn't sent
back they discover the alien technology much later in their
existence - leading to an early death of the species. One of the
original people to be sent back and attempt to fix these events
failed. They had to train a special group in order to complete the
tasks successfully.</p>
<p>People had no idea that it was happening around
them. Their whole world was collapsing and they just lived their lives
like nothing was happening. It didn't make sense for some people. They
just wanted to live out their lives without focusing on the day they
all die. It will happen when it happens. People on the street wielded
signs that read 'The End is Soon'. They yelled about research into a
virus that has started to spread. They are the people of Mars and they
are the last of mankind and now they have a virus on Mars that was
likely created by the one that actives them. The people of mars now
know that Detective was sent back to the past in order to attempt to
stop Antony from activating the Humans. They needed to get Detective or
Sarah to do it. Anyone else would corrupt the process. The Human of
Mars experienced visions of what would happen if it was Sarah that had
actives them on Mars. It showed them all healthy and well in the
present time - instead of being sick and weak like this time line. They
like Antony longed for that time line. Vanessa became under attack from
the People of Mars to release the time split device so others could go
back and attempt to change these events. Vanessa had to improve her
security as the majority of Mars turned against her. It was becoming
unsafe for her to stay on Mars.
Two protesters from opposite sides had gotten into a fist fight. One of
them believing that the world was coming to an end - the other
believing that the world is safe. They end up restoring each other. A
police officer jumps in the break it up. The protesters end up turning
on the police officer - beating him to death, before switching back to
each other. It's a fight to the death. Groups of people stand around
and watch as these two men kill each other. A puddle of blood is left
on the floor after one of them is declared the winner. The body of
the other is dragged off and burnt. Ever since the virus it was
illegal to bury dead bodies. All bodies had to be burnt to make sure they
didn't come back to life. The virus had mutated with Antony's substance
that he used to bring humans back to life. The virus had caused them
to be terrible monstrous creatures. Detective and Vanessa were put in
protection. They couldn't be allowed to be in public as it was too
dangerous for them. The two wondered if this was Antony's doing. Wither
he knew that the virus would mutate to how it did. Maybe it was just
the next evolution in humans. Their bodies covered in red
sores. Itching till they burst. People called for a cure. It was
really the only thing that was keeping Detective and Vanessa alive -
was the thought that they might be able to come up with a cure. It was
Detective that first introduced the substance to the humans if
Mars. Once it was here it spread and mixed with the virus. Hospitals
were over run with reported cases. It closed the schools and work
places. Public spaces were not safe places - unless you were
immune. Some of the human of mars were immune to the mutation. Vanessa
worked with some of these people to find out what makes them immune -
what makes them special. Research is still happening into this but
Vanessa has made great progress in the steps. Once she has solid
research she will start clinical tests of attempting to cure the
infection and making a vaccine for the virus. Vanessa preferred Jass
music and had old 1920s till 40s Jass playing on the over head speaker
as she conducted the experiment to mix the immune genes with
infected. She wasn't one hydras percent sure of what the results would
be. She just prayed that it wouldn't backfire on her. Vanessa didn't
have much time left. The virus was smart and had started mutating to
infect other humans that were previously immune to it. This brought
more panic to the people. A similar event was happening on Mars to
them as it did the people before them on Earth. This time it is
killing everyone more slowly, previously on Earth everyone had died
at the same time.
How does it all end? It's getting close to the end now and everything
needs to be wield down. What areas do they leave open? Vanessa had
found a cure and vaccine for the virus. They had finally stopped
it. Antony was gone. Erased. They tore down the statue of him and his
cat. Humans started to migrate back to Earth. Who knew the future now?
The time split device is missing. The last person seen holding it was
Detective. When he came out of the travel the device was gone from his
hands. Some believe Antony has the device and is still travelling
between times attempting to fix things. There has been no evidence of
this though.
Detective lived happily ever after, as did Vanessa. A library was
created to remember this strange period of time. It was an important
moment for mankind. Never will an event like this take place again.
Once the vaccine was release the protesters stopped. They realised that
Vanessa was right in the cure. The people of Mars were happy with her
and she was elected only the council to run Mars. No longer was it
just one person ruling - but now a group of people. If the word count
gets enough before the library opens people get a fine wiped off their
cards. It's to encourage people to be more productive in the
morning. Many people viewed the library that they created to remember
this time. It had lifelike statues of all the characters involved -
albumin, joey, Sarah, Vanessa, loth'rak, Antony, ubanka,
Micheal and Detective. Some of the characters were minor and not
mentioned often. One example being Micheal. He is the husband of
Albumin and Father of Vanessa. Antony starts messing with
Vanessa's life to attempt to stop her completing her goals in the
future. This doesn't work and Vanessa works around Antony's attempts to
make her fail.</p>
