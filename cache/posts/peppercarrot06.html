<p>The Three Witches  left Pepper and headed into another  room - closing the
door behind them. 'She seems fine', the youngest Witch spoke. The  other two
stood there and steered at the other for sometime. 'The neighbour was not
making it up though, he had  evidence of the events taking place', another
added. The three discussed for sometime how they would deal with Pepper and
the events that had unfolded. Finally they came to a agreement. The three
exited the room and headed towards Pepper.
Pepper stood up from her chair and looked around at her three Godmothers.</p>
<p>Death stood at the door. Leaning against the  wooden frame. He gazed at
Pepper. She stood there, looking back at him.  Her  godmothers  around her.
Death had  yet  to realised that the  neighbour had spotted him walking in the
witches home with Pepper. His jaw dropped when the three witches questioned
Pepper over the event. Death bolted. He left the building. War had failed and
now they were being punished for it. The four horsemen successfully killed
Pepper parents and grandparents. For years Pepper had manoeuvred them.
They had  tracked Pepper down to an orphanage. After her parents  were killed
she was sent here to learn to become a Witch. She was given  a cat that she
named Carrot.
No longer did they have the two magic houses at war with each other, with the
rest of the houses stuck in the middle. The operation was a success but years
later they discovered left overs. Recently returned to the world and attacking
Pepper. Causing her to learn more about her grandparents and parents.
She was the last left in the bloodline. The rest had been hunted down  and
thrown  into Hades.  It was there they were judged in front of the gods and
thrown to hell or allowed into heaven. There has been attempts to return to
the world of Hevena from heaven. Several tried but failed. Once they reached
heaven, there was no escape.
Those that were cast to hell were able to return to the world of the living
and spread Satan's word. It is a horrible job and the pay is lousy.
Some believe that those in hell are given more freedom than those in heaven.
That is until someone escaped from heaven. A rogue Angle attacked heaven
and disabled the security used to stop people escaping. The angel was able
to leave heaven and returned to the world of the living. It was here that
the angel meet a wizard and feel in love. The two had three children.
Another family Saffrons grandparents.</p>
<p>Along with Peppers broom her demons had changed. They were now water and wind
based. She was learning how to control their new powers. The demons would be
similar to what her parents controlled. Peppers great-great-great grandmother
had been an angel from  heaven that had escaped  heaven and returned to the
world of the living. The four horse men were tasked with hunting down  and returning
those that were of the blood tree.</p>
<p>Saffron hurried off to class. She hated being late and today was going to  be
one of those  days. The girl had decided she needed to set her alarm spell to
activate earlier. She didn't need as  much sleep as she use to. It  was
important  for her to focus on her studies. Though she lived in an orphanage
a large sum of her parents fortune was invested into the orphanage. No
expense was  spared for the school. It was the very best. The tutors were
highly trained Witches and Wizards who had spent their lives perfecting their
craft. Peppers tutors had spent their live at their home experimenting
never leaving or achieving anything. They just said they were only
interested in creating a true witch.</p>
<p>Pepper awoke with the sun shining into her eyes. The witch thought she
had left her bedroom window open. Brisk morning breeze brushed her face.
Opening one eye Pepper could see The Great Tree in the distance. The city of
Komonai. She remembered about the potion contest. Realising that she must have
fallen asleep. A winged duck landed on her bed. Pepper looked at it in wonder
&quot;QUACK&quot;, the duck asked Pepper. &quot;You are too kind, but I have a potions
event to attend&quot;, pepper replies to the duck. &quot;Another time?&quot;, smiles
Pepper. The duck fly's off disappointed. Pepper realised that she was being
carried to the potions event with her broomstick lifting he bed with Pepper
and Carrot inside. Pepper thanked Carrot for organising everything and getting
her to the potions event on time. The cat looked down from its perch on the
broom - giving Pepper a thumbs up. Peppers  witches  hat was too her right.#
Pepper  steered at it for a moment. The crinkle fabric  crinkling in the
wind, with the pointed top waving back and  forward. There was a fresh set
of clothes in her bag. Inside the bag was a potion filled with a yellow liquid.
It was not the thick green liquid she had created. Carrot must of packed the
wrong potion. Pepper was disappointed and annoyed with Carrot. There was no
way that the potion was going to work. She had lost already.</p>
<p>Pepper tried to hide her fear when she landed at the event. She stood proud
on her neatly made bed, wearing a fresh set of clothes. Her witches hat sat
on her head. Looking down she waved at the crowd who cheered her on. Her
bed and broom gently landed by the stage. Pepper leaped out with Carrot
springing side to side behind her. Three figures stood on the stage in
front of Pepper. On old grayhaired mustage, short and round man stood with
two young witches - they must of been the same age as Pepper. The dark
skinned witch had a afro, their witches hat
parting it to the side. Around her neck she
wore a necklace with two skulls. Under the
necklace she wore a red jacket and a white shirt
. A pair of goggles wrapped around the neck of her hat. She wore these when riding her
broom.
A fair haired witch stood on the other side.
She had Asian features but her skin was pale
white. Her top was loose hanging with large
open cuffs. Goldern writing patterns on a red
base. Underneath she wore a low cut white
shirt. In her  right hand she clutched a green
liquid filled glass bottle.
There was spose to be four witches completing
today. Pepper was glad she was not the
last to arrive. A purple tip of a hat appeared
in view of those on stage. All four on the
stage looked at the approaching figure.
Under the purple hat was shoulder height
straight blonde hair. Wide blue eyes steered
back. The witch flashed a white smile at the
contestants as she took her place.
Since all four witches had arrived the contest
ready to begin.  The Mayor introduced the
witches.
First was the dark skinned witch Coriander,
travelling from the Technologists Union for
the event.</p>
<p>The witch that had arrived at the event last was next to be announced.
Saffron. She posed for the crowd. Cheers erupted from the crowd.
Saffron believed because it was a home crowd she would have an
advantage on winning. A large sum on gold was part of the prize, along
with scholarships and internships.</p>
<p>The contestants were to demo their potion their potions in the order they
were introduced. Pepper was grateful of this. Perhaps she will have a chance
after all.
The potions had to be used on a test subject. Today's potion contest test subject
was a yellow bird. Coriander was the first witch to demo their potion.</p>
<p>The pale white witch was next.  Her home is</p>
<p>Pepper was the final witch to be introduced. She stood there with her arms
folded looking cross. She was still angry with Carrot and looked at her
cat in dicuist.</p>
