'What could be preping for?,' Vanessa 
wondered. She watches as Antony hands 
Detective a device. Then the footage stops. 
'Damn it', Vanessa curses. 
Something happens that causes all the 
eletronic devices in the area to stop 
working. What they have created is a kill 
switch, even if they don't relize it. 
Vanessa stood up from her chair. 
The camera footage from now is useless.
She needs to find out what that substance was 
and how it brought Detective back to life. 

Detective agreed to the tasks that Antony 
had shown him on the paper. He didn't 
agree with them - they involved either
killing or hurting innocent people - people 
that had no idea about their effect or 
generations after them effect on society. 
Steering at the list of names, dates and 
times, and event almost brought him to 
tears. He had to hold back his emotions. 
If Antony had any idea that he was fully 
consisious then he would be destoried. 

Vanessa had finished researching on the 
substance that Antony injected into 
Detectives brain - bringing him back to life. 
She stood in his surgery room. This was a 
hidden room in the palact that had a bunch
of terminal computers and a table for performing surgerys. There was suspession 
of something like this - but this was 
horrific. Humans had been going missing and 
Vanessa had just worked out what was 
happening - Antony was capturing them and 
performing surgery on them. He was using the 
computers along with the traditinal medical 
aplications. Vanessa had found evidence that
Antony was spicing DNA - mixing alien and 
human genes together to create monsters like
himself.
 
6b345 and Blitz had been assisting Antony in 
the lab. 6b345 had been riped to pieces when 
they spaceship blew up entering the Earth 
atmosphere. Bliz had died in the accident. 
Vanessa had set the explosives on their ship 
to explode when it entered the Earths 
atmosphere. She hadn't expected it to blow 
up over the building that she was attempting 
to smuggle Joey out of - leading to a quick 
escape.  It happened though. 

robots and a cat. The strangest of lab 
assistences. 

On the wall was a framed painting of
Loth'Rak. Vanessa could reconise him. Antony
looked very similar to him. Antony had more 
human features though. Loth'Rak was a 
full alien, well Antony was only half. 

Have they been talking about Vanessa, Antony, 
and Detective too much with the focus taken
away from some other major events. 

What happened to Sarah in the NASA testing 
room. They were preping for the Moon blast. 
The humans knew it was coming. When Detective
was sent back by Antony for the first time in
order to attempt to save Antony from being
driven out of Mars by Vanessa. 

6b345 changes a file that he finds on Mars so
that the robot uprising happens. This begins
when 6b345 finds a red usb on mars. It 
contains the system details for the artcontrol
AI system that was developed to create art. 

The conference that Vanessa attended on Earth
was the Open Education Resource 2860. It was 
organized by robots. They created open 
education resources every day that were used
in teaching of the Humans on Mars. 
Vanessa shows up and messys everything up with
crashing 6b345 and Blitz into the building. 

Need to write Blitz version of the story. 

Blitz was born on 6 August 3555. The dust
on Mars were partickly bad that day. Antony
had created Blitz in the lab. He had mixed
cat, human, and his own human and alien gene
dna systems. It was the same process that 
Loth'Rak used on a human and his alien genes. 
Antony had memories from his Father and could
access all the skills that Loth'Rak posisted.
