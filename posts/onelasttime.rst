The force lifted and pushed me back. Yellow sparks. Thud on the damp floor. Buzzing. Sinking into thick liquid. It seemed to last forever. Someone grabbed my shoulders. Dragged somewhere. The buzzing calmed. Replaced with cries and screaming. Hands on my waist. Someone else was helping. A stream of flashing lights. Blue. Red. Blue. Skidding to a stop.  Lifted onto a stretcher. Medical units surrounding me. A ventilator attached. Darkness. 

A large white room. Flowers and cards on the bedside table. Nurse next to my bed. I expected Mother. She should be here. I tried to speak. Nurse was startled. Drifting off into another world. She explained what happened to Mother. The news. Darkness.

I made a friend. Hannah. Her bed was on the right. We were the same age but different schools. She had won tickets to the concert. This gave her the opportunity to meet Ariana. Hannah showed me the selfie she had taken with her. I didn’t get to meet her. Hannah's Mother had also been killed. 

When Marcus Mumford visited I drifting in and out consciousness. Walking in singing. Guitar in arms. Hannah was excited and sat up in her bed. Her eyes wide. She blushed bright pink when he gave her a cuddle and a kiss on the cheek. He really was a sweetheart. Whispered into my ear: "You are not alone in this".  

Julie was on the left. She hadn’t spoken a word since arriving in the hospital. I found her YouTube. A vlogger. Makeup and lifestyle videos. The latest video posted hours before attending the concert. She had footage of the concert but Julie was too unwell to edit. Her boyfriend and sister died.

My name is Nada Hajjar. This is a story about my family, friends and the events leading up to now. The backstory is needed. You wouldn’t believe me otherwise. I was born at St Mary's Hospital, Manchester as Courtney Hudsen. Our English names now forbidden. New identities with the formation of Islamic State of Britain. Too far. Lets start again. 

My name is Courtney Hudsen. I was born in St Mary's Hospital, Manchester. I liked my name. Courtney. Mother had choosen it. Names are important. They help with identity and show heritige. I wasn’t given a middle name. Sometimes you use your Mothers maidian name. I was given it as my last name. Fathers name on my birth cert was reducted. Mother wouldn’t speak about it. 

Let’s talk about Julie. She was a year younger than me and Hannah. From her videos she was outgoing and fun. You wouldn’t believe it now. A changed girl. Scars covered her face. She had basically taken the full force. Her boyfriend had protected her. Standing between her and the explosion. Julies Sister had pealed off for merchandice. She was even closer to the blast.  

What was that? What the fuck was that? Oh my god.

That’s what someone had spoken as the blast went off. They were late leaving the concert. House lights had just came up. Ariana music was still playing buy she had left the stage. It was a horrible, horrible moment. The worse moment of my life. There was nothing worse than that. I never recovered. It got better after months but it changed me. It changed us all there. Nothing was the same afterwards. 

I couldn’t think of a reason why I would change my name.  

This is a story about my family, friends and the events leading up to now. The backstory is needed. You wouldn’t believe me otherwise. I was born at St Mary's Hospital, Manchester as Courteny Hudsen. Our English names now forbidden. We were given new identities when Islamic State took power. Too far lets start again. 

English was my favourite subject. I enjoyed reading and reviewing books. I didn’t enjoy movies as much. Strange really. Majority of my generation would differ. Speaches were easy. I just found an author I was interested in and researched them and their books. Relateting them to life lesions. Can’t be faulted for that. 

There was nothing else. 

I will not hear what you have to say. 

I will live my life as it’s meant to be. 

They would of gone on

Angels. 

A hospital bed row of girls all with laptops.  A unix-like system run on them all. Microsoft Windows had been outlawed. That’s one thing that didn’t bother me. 

From outside of Manchester.

My name is Nada Hajjar and I am Muslim. This is a story about me, my family and friends and the events leading up to now. You wouldn’t believe me. The backstory is needed. I am safe though. I am alive. I will stay alive. I was not born Nada Hajjar. We were given new identities when Islamic State took power. Our English names were forbidden. Everyone had to learn Arabic. It was the offical language. English was no longer concered a major language. Man still spoke it but it private. There were underground schools that taught English. All books except for the Koran were burnt. Hundrards of years of human knowledge. it was such a waste. archieve is important.   

She was due to celebraite her birthday next week. Sweet 16th. Instead of a party plans changed to a funeral. Many of the items that were going to be used for her 16th Party were used at the funeral. It was devastating for the family to lose her. 

She had been given the concert ticket for her 16th birthday. It was her first pop concert. 

They say keep calm and carry on. You got to consider events.  Motivated revenge killing for the children and woman killed in Libya. They can’t use that excuse. Bring the troops home.  Resources focused on us. Fight this foreign policy. 

What was that? What the fuck was that? Oh my god.

Repeat things a lot - words, catchphrases, references to events, and important scenes. New repetition results in deeper understanding of situation.

Hannah was the happiest she had ever been. It was her first concert without her parents. Her sister and mother were waiting at the entrance. She could see them in the distance. Her sister was on her phone. Typing away and taking a selfie. She would be on Snapchat. Mother reading on her Kindle.  

We let the girl on crutches go ahead of us. She would of not been able to dance. At least she got to attend the concert though. Many of my friends were not able to attend. They were jealous. I couldn’t wait till school in the morning sharing the events in show and tell. Several of my classmates attended the concert. Girls all had their phones out filming.  

Blame the balloons. Several balloons had popped but this was louder. The stadium to shacked. Everyone looked towards the direction. Silence for a moment. Then screams. I thought the stairs had collapsed. People were running and screaming. Some people were crying.

Mother held my hand. Her beautiful wide smile. She had chosen a dark red lipstick tonight. 

Hold my hand. Don’t let go. We are going to walk out of here. Do not run. Don’t copy what they are doing. People need education. Running in a crowded area only causes issues. 

Rewinding the CCTV footage. Thumb holding trigger. Go. Camera out. Fowler area. Parents are waiting for their children to walk out. Kids coming out of their first concert. There were twelve years old at the show with friends. Their parents or family were there to pick them up.    

Hannah didn’t survive. No girl in the bed. but hospital for months. One of the few to survive. Hannah was created to hide the facts. A mechanism to block. It took many years to understand about what occurred that night. 

I was on the train arriving in Victoria Station when the explosion happened. Everyone in the carrage thought we had hit something. A minute later we relized what had happened.  

After I finished high school I went onto Oxford. I studied Chemistry. Everything had been paid for through a scholarship for victims. All my living expensises. I didn’t need to go and find a job. I could focus on my studies. At the start of my second year I got a internship at a local lab. I know what you are thinking. The only reason why a teen girl from Manchester learns Chem is to produce pills for her associates. And that’s what I did. Purchase a pill printer and machines. Connected to a raspberry pi and ardino. The whole setup could produce pills on it’s own. It would also learn patient data and make adjustments automatically. If you can give every house hold it own robotic doctor it reduces the demand for human Doctors. Every household in Manchester will have it. Then the UK. And the World. Mars. I had put all the lawnmowers in the area out of business. My robotic mowers would go house to house and cut their lawns. Electric and Solar panels. No money was exchanged. If the person wanted to support they could give a recurring payment. Petrol was a rarity so any old petrol mowers had it converted to electric. Very few people had driven a old gas car. They were all electric now. Some of the gas cars were on display in museums. Once a year they will have a events where they start a gas car and race is around a circic. Hundreds of thousand attend.   
The lab had everything I needed to create the pills. It was too dangerous to produce them in the lab. I started to steal parts of the machines. Carried the machine out in my handbag.  

God is Great. Peace be with you. Under his eye. 

Pass through customs into the Islamic State of Briton is always a scary experience. Questions to make sure nonbelievers do not enter the country. Convert to Islam or death. The Royal family slaughted and replaced with Arab Royals.  

Churches were burned. Mosics were built in place. All religions illegial except for Islam. Allah is God. Woman were not allowed to drive or work. Many Americans were kept as slaves. A large amount of the population imagrated from the Middle East to Britin. It was a better lifestyle. 

When the anti encrytion laws came into effect lead to the downfall of the internet. The old govt had introduced a Great Brition Firewall. It lead to vonubilities of the platform. The jamming resulted in less and less people having access to the computer. When the power grid, water treatment plants and communactions were disabled that was the end. The old govt had to surrender to save people. It would of been best to just let us die. Life was horrible. The Islamic State flag flew down every street. Things sure had changed from the past. The EU had declared that ISB was a terriorist state and they came under heavy suncions. Trade and flights were restricted. ISB was cut off from the world in similar to what North Korea was in the past. That’s one country that changed after the form of ISB.

Manchester, Monday, 22 May 2017, 10.30 p.m. 

Late evening

No words. Tears. No laughter. Fears. Darkness. The music died.

The end is near. 

Finger held down the trigger. If he lifted it off the device would detonate. He looked around. So many young and innocent. It was revenge. For the attacks in Syria. 
When he let go of the trigger nothing happened. Several plain clothing officers jumped him. Culffed and arrested. The concert goers were safe. There were altenatives. What they had built allowed events from the past to be modified. When they pinpointed one key event that lead to the downfall agents were sent back to modify events.  The main task was to stop the bomb from detonating. It was important that the task of attempting to detonate the bomb happens. This way they can be arrested and no other events will happen. The key task was to stop the bomb from detonating. It would be modified to stop it from detonating when the trigger is released. It frustrated the bomber. He clicked the trigger multiply times but no response. He should be dead. Entering the gates of the Kingdom. Instead hes in a police cell being questioned by two detectives. tick for tac. He knew the game. They expected him to dob the others in. He will get off lightly. Serve a few years on home detention. They didn’t have the evidence. If they did they wouldn’t be questioning him for information. They would of charged him with something. They would raid and investigate. They won’t find anything. He just had to wait it out. They can’t hold him without charging. 
When they finally released him he went home. His home was a trash. The police had done a good job of turning the place upside down. It’s important that the police move quickly when these attacks happen. It enforces to the public that they are needed. Always going on about the antagonist. It’s important to get their side. Why they did it. They believe they are praising allah by killing nonbelievers. Everyone is a believer now. There is still killing. It was just a excuse. Rights have been removed. Return to the room. It wasn’t much different to the police cell. There were a few extra items but they had it good in the cell. All alone. They kept the other prisiners separate. There would be violence otherwise. The guards wouldn’t be able to stop it.

Let’s talk about another subject. Everyday I would wake up and the thoughts of the attack would go through my head. Spending more time thinking about the victims than those around me. Take elements of the victims and write a novel. Of course that’s what they are going to do.

My name is Baal Zebub. I’m the only boy. There are three girls here. Hannah, Julie and Courtney. They didn’t notice me. They couldn’t. I was wrapped from head to toe in bandages. I have burns to the majority of my body. 
I hear everything they say. They chat about everything. 
One day the nurses told the girls about me. They had no idea and were shocked at the state of me. Each of them came up to my bed. Stroked my hand. Introducing themselves. 
It was my plan that landed us all in hospital. I was meant to die in the attack. Instead I survived and recovering in hospital. Like these girls. They are innocent though. They didn’t plan this. I am a suspect and the police have two armed officers at the door. The burns I suffered meant that I am not going far though.

vivid memories. felt so betrayed. For years they were in our lives. Undercover. The taxpayers were paying for it. 

We start with the name of the character and where they are. The people around them and what they think of them. What happened to the people. Usually they were dead. Get them to explain the actions of each other. For example Courtney explains Stans actions of a second attempted attack. Everything is Courtney explaining events from the past. It’s her perspective of events. Not everything is correct and she is bias. Is something really bad about to happen next? Elements of a horror genre. Do not like this. Puts me off. Did not finish Cat’s Eye. Found myit 
She talks about the attacker - Stan. In Stans mind he is free but he got caught. The relatity that Staself annoyed by the something bad is going to happen next. It doesn’t stop. I can’t do anything about this. It’s a horror. 

n creates is false. Without a clue in the world. The story talks of both realities. The real true: the bomb doesn’t go off and Stan is arrested. In Stans mind the prision is the hospital. In Stans mind they are in hospital after the bomb exploding. Hannah, Julie, Courtney, Stan. It’s told from Hannahs perspective if the bomb had gone off. It didn’t though - this is just the imagination of Stan. Believing in another world. Dream sequences suck though. Don’t want to make the whole novel just a dream. A dream of a better world. 

Who are we going to talk about next? random int between zero an d four. Characters to choose from. Courtney. Julie. Hannah. Stan. Baal Zebub. Nurse.

Baal Zebub was the only one missing from the hospital. Every other named character is in hospital. Lucky for Baal Zebub he was nowhere near the blast when it occurs. He was too busy fishing through garbage. A swarm of flies at his command. Able to swarm target and absorb their energy. He targeted those that derserved it. Police looked the other way. Baal Zebub was doing their job for them. They were able to sit back - eat donuts and watch porn. Baal Zebub would bring in the heads of those that were wanted. Their eyes removed but dental records able to confirm the body. The family of the victim are petrafied. They never expected it. These are normal, everyday people. Often they have a hidden past. It’s that hidden past that Baal Zebub is interested in. Anything that can give the upper hand. Flies swarmed around Baal Zebub. Opening his mouth flies emerged. Chocking some came out in a wet, slimy, soggey covered ball. It stuck to the table. Veins of blood ran through it. 

Those are the only characters that have names. Everyone else is refered as their relationship to named characters. 
 

This is so not twisted. I really have no idea what they are doing. It’s best to just go along with it. Writing about just really horrible events and it just brings tears to your face when you write about it. That’s why we don’t write about it. We move on. That’s what the victims would want.  Not thinking about them for a day is good. Once it’s down to just the thought and no action things improve. When you get the thought and have to do action that’s when there is an issue. Must it’s alright. under my thumb. it is the easy way. No way they were going to let them escape. The guards were doubled. They couldn’t risk something happening again. Once was already bad enough. 
Seprate concert goers and those picking them up. Meet through security. Should not of been able to get the bomb into the fowler. There is your first fuck up. 

The machine that they build was something out of a Phillip K. Dick novel. It gave them the ability to arrest criminals before they commit the crime. The machines looks into deaths in the future - if it’s homaside then check footage of death and deploy bot lawyers to research the case. Arrest and trial those that are found guilty. They are only arrested if they are guility. The machine finds out before the arrest is allowed. This strips out corruption in the police force. Everyone is given the same treatment in the law. This is how the bomber is caught. He was an early case. They were extremly late in intercepting coms with the target. It won’t be long. Let’s keep this going. Once it is fixed then we can go to the river. It’s a beautiful day why cant we just sleep. It is just going to go around and around every time. I’m not sure why they have not published it yet. It’s quite weird really. If anyone else had given them something this loaded it would be on the front page. But because it’s me they have not even looked into the content. There was evidence of a machine. For years there were rumurs that this machine had been built. It allowed lawenforcment to arrest criminals before they commited the crime. It was a instant success. Years went by without a murder. Some arrested may of been innocent. The machine could be lying. Showing false information. That’s the scary thing. It got to a point when we couldn’t verify that the suspect was a criminal. There were protest to scrap the machine. This wasn’t going to happen. This conflict caused a rift in society. On one side those that want the machine to be used. the other side do not want the machine to be used. There are those that sit in the middle - allow use through greater regalation. 

Stan why couldn’t you just go away. It would make the world such a better place. But there would be one less novel. 

They want you to travel to their home country and kill their countrymen. That’s why they did it. It’s simple game theory. Have we not been over this before. Let’s continue. Stay home. Protect your country. Going over there just continues the cycle.

The arrest of Stan happened almost two months after the attack. He was spotted at an airport in Liverpool. They suspected he was trying to leave to Syria. Police were fortunate to pick him up as there had been no arrests this month. Now that the police have Stan they can question him about the attack and find out more information. This may lead to more arrests. They couldn’t look like they were letting the public down. Eyes were on them but they were sympethic. It was a balance. They were there to do a job but they needed to be protected. They were targets. Those that were targeted should not of been. People would of been more sympethic with Stan if militery/police/govt units were targeted. Those that you hit supported your cause. They didn’t like how it was carried out. The targets were wrong. They are not the people that you should be aiming at. It doesn’t make your cause look good. I can make your cause good. I can show them that it works. Together we will change this country.

ok lets see how we get on, im not sure if this is working but if it is then all good. lets not  decide on something straight away. best to wait and see what happens, if everything is legit then no issues. thats what i need to sort.

it was a gritty tale of betrayal. once something legit comes along it will be ok. the study of business is pointless, lets just build something instead. with a space that i can use to create stuff. thats how its going: to be totally legit is where it is at. lets see if we can get further ahead. oh but its a waste. sometimes im not sure how real this is or not. space marines. those that travel from country to country selling everything they can. sometimes they rip off those that they planning on helping. for a second or two.

exit music. Sadness drifted through the church. It was the final 

Less super nature elements and more just writing a solid story and characters. Since it is literary the story doesnt matter so much. It’s driven by the characters. That’s the thing that has to be remembered. Everytime I write it’s just about getting down something about the character. How they feel. What they see. It’s the only way that it will be finished. They had focused the majority of their resources into tracking down any leads   

The day following the attack was a sad day for the city. Crowds gathered to remember those that had died.

Walking down the road and witnessing mass genoside. There was nothing else in my lifetime that would be so cruel. They had opened fire on their own people. Bodie layaround me. The flesh melted and disolved. wow so much was written and lost. That's the thing about this system. It can be just freeze sometimes and nothing to do in order to fix it. I just reboot the system. Walking down the road and witnessing mass genoside. There was nothing else in my lifetime that would be so cruel. They had opened fire on their own people. Bodie lay around me. The flesh melted and disolved. wow so much was written and lost. That's the thing about this system. It can be just freeze sometimes and nothing to do in order to fix it. I just reboot the system. Once the restart happens everything is fine. The genoside is over. There is no more killing. No more death. The news never makes it. It is forgotten. Those girls grow up in a new world. A happy new fresh world where everything is ok. Do you have a backdoor? No. You are lying arn’t you. Of course. As part of our contract with the ISB all our hardware has a backdoor. It allows packet-inspection of talk users do. im not sure why this was talking so long. once it started to work it was ok. we could create a new system everyday. come on and let it go. lets let it slide. why don’t you be me. everything is fine. lets take the slow way home. there is no need to rush. when you rush it can get mixed up with some of the previous. 

Judging by the previous two comments you guys are out of touch about how this works. If a one and a two. Three. Four. lalala. Let’s go camping everyone goes camping. how did it come to this. Let’s check if there is anything else to sort. Once it is, everything is ok. Let’s go and check on the rest of the options. Come back I still need you. Let me take your. I swear. Hold on now. Going around the bend it took awhile but it was worth it. There was not alot left except for this. Please don’t do that it is very distracting. Come back now. Let’s check this out. I swear I need to all my life. Hold on I still need you. I just want to get back already. It’s been taking too long already. It’s intersting to reread why I write. Able to type in a crypto way. There were only three left. Once they were gone there was nothing left for them to do. Currently behind but thats nothing to worry about. Typing more and more. Once there is enough we will go through with the rewards. There is always many awards and paybacks for the activities.

Continue repeating of the bad habits. They never really stop. They don’t change. That’s what he told himself when he thought it was bad. It was never bad. That word was not used. There are far better words to be typing than that. More intelligent and grownup. Let’s not saying he was not grown up. By all accounts he was a well-rounded young man. His schooling had been top notch. Private schools throughout. All that was in the past now. The future was not so clear. The choice to not move state was unusual for those attending collage. But he was different. He decided to stay home and attend collage. Once there was a little girl who every  day would attend to her commercial garden. Her back lawn was covered in five glass houses - all filled with vegetation. Automatic sprinklers took care of majority of the work that needed to be done. Drones would fly from house to house clipping the fresh produce and letting it drop into the drones carrier basket. Once this basket was full the drone would return to the main factory where the produce was sorted and shipped out. The goal was to increase the production of the worlds food supply with the help of automaton computers. From the very start people had objected but as the world died due to hunger those that opposed were converted. Supply chain for food was fixed. The glass houses were able to be setup anywhere. They could handle any climate and weather patterns. They could be controlled to grow certain produce. For example bananas would require a higher temp than potatoes or onions. The drones that collected the produce also weeded the garden. Security was an issue and the drones were set to detect any external lifeforms such as snails and slugs - and deal with them. This greatly increased the amount of lost produce due to food being in a abundance. 
 
The drone were feed waste which then turned it back into soil for the garden. You didn’t have to do any gardening in order to get a freshly garden picked meals. It was a dream for everyone. You were most welcome to help the driod out. Some people liked to garden and could be employed to garden and have their actions scanned in order to teach the machines to garden. As humans learnt to garden, machines mimiced their motions. Testing lines were created. Robotic hands and arms would use a shovel to dig into the soil. 

The glass houses kept logs on what people consumed and created with the produce. The company was able to then do targeted marketing to the consumers. They had logs on everyone and their full diet information. The company began expanding the areas in which they did business. No longer were they supplying automaton gardeners and software support but they were moving into banking, insurance. 

Damn damn damn. Why did it have to go so badly. Everything was going fine until it just got too big. Too big to fail they say. That’s an understatement. Mankind had never seen such a time like it. It was risky but it’s weird that it went so overboard. One day everything was going fine and they next everyone had lost it. I’m not sure if they knew it would get so bad. It’s hard to think back before the events. Before everything changed. There was only a minority that warned us against what might happen. Of course we didn’t listen to them. Some of them were even killed for the views they had. Now we must make sure that people are not punished for the views they hold - only how they act. The extremest views spread. All over the place people were maiming others over small insufficient things. It was a battlefield. For what. For some events that happened years ago. Still every year on the day people get out of bed on weekend and pay their ‘respects’ for those that fell in the events. Really every year. This had been going on for such a long time there were questions that it was only being kept around to keep people loyal and from speaking out over the inhuman treatment that was happening. Unsure how much of this really works. But at the end of the day it doesn’t really matter. As long as the machine works when it gets activated is all that really matters. 

How to write a novel. One character after another. It is quite simple. If there is a block move onto something else. Start a new line and expand on a area from the previous paragraph. This could be a different view or shift. Whatever you choose to do it doesn’t matter. All that matters is getting down the words for another rough draft novel. Despite all the rage. They still cant believe they can be saved. The glass houses had to be rolled out worldwide. It was able to be used to save the billions around the world that were starving. They were able to create their own food supply with the glass houses.

There is nothing I can do. Wait i am coming now. That may of been the last thing she said. I wonder if she spoke to anyone on her way. A scan of the security footage showed no conversation. The last frame was her walking into an unknown building. She never left the building. A 360 degree search was carried out of the building. It showed no results. There was no body. There was nobody. It was a mystery to what happened to the girl. Most hope that she is safe. That she didn't want the life she had and decided to disappear and change it all. Others are more dark and say she was killed. it is unlikely that another will ever know what happened. Clever they thought but it wasn't going to last. Things changed. As was said before. Things went bad. Then worse. Finally the end happened. That's when everyone died. If they had changed a few of their bad habits it might of not happened. But they cant change it now. With everyone dead the world goes on but there is no activity. Everything is dried up and dead. The cycles of seasons continued like before. Creatures and animals roamed the world. A world with no humans life. Killed out by their own greed. They wanted everything and in the end they got nothing. Cities of empty waste. 

Waste was not what the little boy had been taught to do. He was an efficient person and would spend his time on productive activities. One area he focused on was his sleeping patterns. He could get on with a minimal of 5 hours sleep a night. It was important that he avoid caffeine and other drugs. Cannabis is allowed but it is suggested to monitor usage. If use falls behind a certain percent. Most patients decide to get a injection that releases cannabis to the body over a monthly period. Liberty is respected. You do not have to get a injection but its suggested by the medical production. It can also initial you to certain bonuses and perks. The injection is engineered to release certain strains at certain times. It causes a joint smoking simulation. The is fine to be used indoors - the smoke can be adjusted to not visible or remove the smell. If you didn't like the smell you could setup the ability to turn off other peoples smells. This made it great in public - you could smell a beauty of flavors or none at all. It catered for all people. it was inclusive. now that's a trigger word. who am i going to write about next. the first novel had a character in it based on a mod from r/redditgetsdrawn - itwillbemine. I made the character in my novel fat, useless, and has a string of issues. Characters in FallofCopy were inspired from computer conferences and meet ups I attend and the people I meet. Write a novel every year. nanowrimo is a great chance for this. Write regular. Short stories. Novella. Novel. Just write more. 

The boy giggled as he walked past the girl. She was sitting there with her notebook and pen. Drawing. Lists and graphs is what she should be doing. Instead she is drawing. Landscapes. Wavy green water, red hills, yellow figures and a blue sky. That is the question. What is the answer? It is hard to picture something different. He walked past her with one eye closed. Vision was always an issue. Surgery would help. It is wrong to be able to see out of one eye better than two eyes. Vision and eyes will always be important research for the boy. The mutations grew quickly. Not long the boy was growing old. Bed ridden and dying. The testing of injection had created deformities in the bodies cells. No longer were they what they were. The human DNA table was remarked. Scientists were fascinated. Never before had something like this happened. It was like the human race had involved over night. All their children were being born with the new strain. Their bodies were able to produce the injections themselves - they did not need to go to the doctors. They were more independent. It was still all the benefits. They were able to consume when they wanted or set it up to do it automate. The system had worked fine with the current vision. Why would anyone want to change things. People did take sides. Some were further than others. There were arguments and fights over how to deal with the changes. But there is only a certain amount of more words that can be applied to the results. If something goes really bad then lets not worry about what happens. If you are going to say one tech is going to make a service outdated then you need information backing up specific reasons why. Be prepared for questions.
   

Down. Once there was a little boy who every day would go out and look for a little girl. They had lost one another. Attempts were made to unite but all attempts had been a fail. 

Lets see how this new setup goes. Everything is clensed. It was a success They said. It is totally posible to just type without glasses on. It’s a bit like typing without seeing what i am typing. It doesnt matter what is written. This is going to turn into a novel at some point. Just not today. How many rough drafts will get written. zIt would be better to write more often so that when it comes to writing the novel in noveember, its not so hard. ok lets tyu ythis again. It’s onluy several more lines untill the green fills up all of the red. it is also better to look awauyy from the keyboard. im looking towards the screen butt it is Tired so tired. The smell of urine. Paants were stained yellow. it was gross but he had no reason to change them until the morning. All these things you hold inside. Lets ty this gaain. The first time it failed but they think the next time it will be better. Attempting to finished a novel in a month is totally posible. It;s just about puttinng the time in every fay. i wonder what conferences will be on this year in novembber. last year the kiwicon conference conflicedted with my writing. I will alwawys blame kiwicon for the reason i didnt finish the novel. everything was going fine will then. once the trip happened i was unable to get into the flow and it was a fail. Still managed to finish 32000 words. I have been given on feedback over the whole novel but i did take the first chapter into my writers group and got some good feedback. Will try this again. It’s hard to read with the current eyesight. Eeverything is slightly burly. If the glasses are taken off everything wiould be much clear. But it blurs due to poor eyesight. I wonder if i will get no email from the recent event. I go to these conferences but never get emails from people. Im quite bad about emeialing. A few in levin need to be sent emails. Was sent emails that mad me smile and i didn’t even reply if you want people to keep sending emails its important to. Oh I can’t stop. 

e0k4 0f once in a awhile there was a little girl who fell in love. The boy didnt love her back, He was too young. He just wanted to go outsie and play. He wasnot interested in her. Lets tyy this again oh but its not the same as whenthey were going to change it come on come on lets just get this over and done with. I wonder how much worse the spelling is this time than it was before. at leaast i know where th words go. The ereader screen blasts light into his face. The light is also coming from a Rosebus. Citizen Kne was a film that the little boy had watched many times. It was certainly his favorite. The boy had seen it so much he was able to quote the wholefilm. Its not a book. Everything that it gets written down it needs to be sorted as aa film and not book. That is the most important rule. Lets see if the novel can be finished in under forty eight hourse With both the eyes and the ears gone it was hard to comunacate. The besy option was written coms. People would writet messages on paper and wave them around the place in order to get the atenation of the person that the message is intended for. Its getting to the point where tired is tarting to kick in. It’s been greaat to be reading and wriing again. It’s been a few months since i havebeen able to finish a book. Lets stop writing and put away the glasses. if the reading goes well the writing can begin again  sometimes i woory that the text doesnt come out but it does we just need to get to the end of this line quciker. What parts of the previous two / three novels do i want to take and use them in the new nove. too far away from the city can be a large issue. Butt thankfully there are sultions to fixing the issue. Let’s see if this makes sense. He knew she wouldd be at the conference. The boy wasnt interested in the content of the conference. He would attend - make convosation with venfors m network with others there, watch a few speakers. butot over do it. Take it wasy. `
 oh weell sy ltsdy  there was snot s slot to sort after  u do baws is a service that may be used im not even sure if that is the corrrect spelling if it is wrong then i am truely screwed but if it wis working fine then it doesnt even mater. i wish that this place didnt have a tv but its hard to change things like this when there is something wrong with the oh boy there was nothing going on till the man in the mushroom house. came out and started to yell. over and over he screamed. The people on the street didnt know what was going on. 

one last time. 

  

it was just quiet. silence


Yellow. Buzzing. The force lifted me up and pushed backwards. Thud on the floor. It seemed to be a life time. Someone had grabbed me under the arms. Dragged towards the exit. The buzzing sound began to calm. Replaced with cries and screaming. Hands on my waist. Someone else was helping lift me. A stream of flashing lights. Blue. Red. Skid to a stop. Medical units sourounded. I was lifted onto a stretcher  and into the ambulence. Medical units sourounded me. A mask was placed onto my face. Darkness. 

I awoke in a white room. Flowers and cards scatted around me. Beside a nurse sat. I was expecting my Mother. She should be the one sitting with me. I chocked out the words. ‘Where is my Mummy?’. The nurse was strartled. Drifting off into another world. ‘Oh thank god you are awake’ she smiled. She called for a Doctor. Several Doctors rushed towards me. They explained what happened and why my Mother was not there. The news caused me to drift off again into the darkness.   

Na na. THE TASTE OF VOMIT. ghjdhk

i dont want to know what happened next. Lets check if anything happened. No change. Lets see what happens. There is no need to hit that button. Everything goes so wrong after. 
Oh. wow. i cant believe that it reveresed. Awake with no issues. Lets check.Once upon a time. there was a girl named COURTNEY. she was a lovely person. friendly and happy. she didnt want harm to come to anyone. rather lose her own life than someone else. rare quality. mostly people care about themselves. something was different about courtney though. 

Sign of the time. Guards stood outside houses on the street. A large gate. They were protecting the girls mostly. Rebels would try to break in and kidnap the girls. Could not have that happen. It would be a bad look. Tears still flowed from her face. She wanted to go home. Being stuck in a hospital bed was not the way she wanted to spend her birthday. Everything was planned. The baloons were already setup. People were waiting for her to walk through the door. But it was never gonna happen. Those waiting at the party got the news. It was devestating. Courtney was going to be turning sixteen years old. No one was in the party spirit. They decided to cut the cake and eat it. In her memory. Courtney would of wanted that. Whatever happens, there will always be cake.

I was there the bombs fell. The Queens rebel launched attack against ISB. They targeted militery areas but citizens were caught up in the attack. Everyone was forced to join the army, including woman. It meant the rebel forces could not trust anyone. Every one of them could be a threat. The attack was devesatating for ISB. They lost the majority of their infustrucal. Oh but it was not over the ISB. The top were driven under ground. Hidden bunkers with years supply of food and drink. Everything you would need to live out the imediatle future. 

Stop your crying. It's gonna be alright. The end is soon. 

When the explosion goes
