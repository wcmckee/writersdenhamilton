The first KiwiPyCon I attended was back in 2013. The 
location was the AUT campus in Centeral Auckland 
This year it is in Christchurch. I have been typing 
python code since 2011 so it took me 'several years 
to discover the conference. In 2013 I was living in 
Levin and took the night bus from Levin to Auckland 
on Friday night. I arrived at KiwiPyCon early on 
Saturday morning. I had paid for a student/unwaged 
ticket. I didn't attend the dinner on Saturday 
night. I had my dell laptop with me and can remember 
typing python code with IPython Notebook. I didn't 
attend KiwiPyCon last year in Wellington. Bit silly 
of me really - but I did watch the talks on YouTube. 
This year I applied for finacial assistence and they 
were very generious - my ticket was paid for along 
with $100.00 towards my travel. I am going to be 
staying at a friends of a friends place in chch. 
It's a caravan so unlikely to be anything special. 
I'm not worried though - as long as I have a roof 
over my head and a shower I will be fine. The 
caravan is located at a park where there are showers 
and such.


This year is the first year that the conference is 3 
full days. In the past its been just the Saturday 
and Sunday. Though I believe in the past they have 
had tuturials on the friday.

I've taken a look at the talks. I need to decide on what
track to go to - 1 or 2. 
Things I'll mostly be interested in hearing about:
Web Development. API, static blogs, design.
robotics. Raspberry Pi. 
Education.

I am less interested in database and cloud related topics.
Things like Openstack.

I am planning to work on Nikola on the Friday. In the
afternoon there are  beginner tuturials, and sprints.

There was a call on the mailing list for people to give a
interest of any topics to sprint on.
There was mention of pip, 
and my Nikola.
The creator of Nikola Roberia even expressed interest to 
me on Twitter that he may be advable for hours/day if it 
goes ahead. 
I'd like to see it happen. I will be working on it and
encourage others to join me.	
	
I'm not sure what types of people I would get. Some 
may be experts with static blogs. Others may never of
heard of them. 
I'll be willing to help people in getting started with
Nikola, but the best thing to do is read the site and 
use it before the spring.

In November there is the NaNoWrite. Write 50,000 
word novel. 2014 was the first year I attempted this.
I'd like to write a self biologey. Or maybe a autobiography
on someone. 
My best friend Peter could be interesting to write 50,000
words about. 
It might be better to take his character and write it 
into a fiction character

Currently sitting in Auckland airport. I have my boarding 
pass and just waiting to board. It's an overcast day, but 
it's not raining suprisinly. 
When I first arrived I had a panic attack and went through
the security without getting my boarding pass. As soon as 
I was through security I relized my mistake and went back 
to collect my boarding pass. 


Currently I am on flight to christchurch. The 
takeoff was smooth and I have an excellent window 
view of New Zealand. Just experienced a little 
turtalence but it was minor. The flight is only 
going to take an hour. We are above the clouds and 
looking down all I can see is ocean and some 
coastline. I was sitting at the wrong gate - I 
thought it was gate 30, but
but turns out it was gate 21. I noticed when someone else
was asking about Jetstar and they were redirected.
I quickly packed my Pi up and headed to the correct gate.
I was one of the last thoough the gate but I wasn't late.
There is no free food or drink on this flight.
I have a bottle of water and two sandwhichs. They are in my
bag though which is in the overhead lockers. Once I land
in Chch I will put on warm clothes, eat my food.
I then need 
The food and drink service has just closed - we have 
almost arrived in chch.

In Python related news the third and final keynote has
been announced - Alison ? who works for Dropbox.
This means that there is three female keynote speakers
at KiwiPyCon. This has to be a first. 
It's great there is such a large number but I do hope they
are not keyspeakers just because they are female. 

Katie comes from a education background so the talk will
likely not be very techniqaual. Lets hope it's not wishy
washly. 


Once they announce trays up I'm going to switch off the pi
and pack it into my laptop bag. 

The flight is almost over. It was a smooth flight but my
stomach is a bit sore. 

The mountains have snow on them. It is very mountionous.
This has to be the south island. 

Sadly I left my camera at home. I guess it's one thing
I won't lose. 

The plane is almost completely full - I'm at the back row
(30) and there is no one in the five seats beside me. '

Time to shutdown. Till we arrive.


testing the pi!

Tonight I went to CatalystIT and heled cutting volcous 
items. First was
