The Three Witches  left Pepper and headed into another  room - closing the 
door behind them. 'She seems fine', the youngest Witch spoke. The  other two
stood there and steared at the other for sometime. 'The neighour was not 
making it up though, he had  evidence of the events taking place', another  
added. The three discussed for sometime how they would deal with Pepper and 
the events that had unfolded. Finally they came to a agreement. The three
exited the room and headed towards Pepper.
Pepper stood up from her chair and looked around at her three Godmothers.

Death stood at the door. Leaning against the  woodern frame. He gazed at 
Pepper. She stood there, looking back at him.  Her  godmothers  around her. 
Death had  yet  to relized that the  neighbour had spoted him walking in the
witches home with Pepper. His jaw dropped when the three witches questioned
Pepper over the event. Death bolted. He left the building. War had failed and
now they were being punished for it. The fourhorsemen successfully killed 
Pepper parents and grandparents. For years Pepper had manovered them. 
They had  tracked Pepper down to an orphage. After her parents  were killed 
she was sent here to learn to become a Witch. She was given  a cat that she
named Carrot.   
No longer did they have the two magic houses at war with each other, with the
rest of the houses stuck in the middle. The operation was a success but years 
later they discovered left overs. Recently returned to the world and attacking
Pepper. Causing her to learn more about her grandparents and parents. 
She was the last left in the bloodline. The rest had been hunted down  and 
thrown  into Hades.  It was there they were judged in front of the gods and 
thrown to hell or allowed into heaven. There has been attempts to return to 
the world of Hevena from heaven. Several tried but failed. Once they reached
heaven, there was no escape. 
Those that were cast to hell were able to return to the world of the living 
and stread satans word. It is a horrible job and the pay is lousy. 
Some believe that those in hell are given more freedom than those in heaven.
That is until someone escaped from heaven. A rogue Angle attacked heaven 
and disabled the security used to stop people escaping. The angel was able 
to leave heaven and returned to the world of the living. It was here that 
the angel meet a wizard and feel in love. The two had three children. 
Another family Saffrons grandparents. 

Along with Peppers broom her demons had changed. They were now water and wind
based. She was learning how to control their new powers. The demonss would be
similar to what her parents controlled. Peppers great-great-great grandmother
had been an angel from  heaven that had escaped  heaven and returned to the 
world of the living. The fourhorse men were tasked with hunting down  and returning
those that were of the bloodtree. 

Safron hurried off to class. She hated being late and today was going to  be 
one of those  days. The girl had decided she needed to set her alarm spell to
activate earlier. She didn't need as  much sleep as she use to. It  was 
important  for her to focus on her studies. Though she lived in an orphage 
a large sum of her parents fortune was invested into the orphanage. No 
expense was  spared for the school. It was the very best. The tutors were 
highly trained Witches and Wizards who had spent their lives perfecting their
craft. Peppers tutors had spent their live at their home experiementing 
never leaving or achieving anything. They just said they were only 
interested in creating a true witch. 

Pepper awoke with the sun shining into her eyes. The witch thought she
had left her bedroom window open. Brisk morning breeze brushed her face.
Opening one eye Pepper could see The Great Tree in the distance. The city of 
Komonai. She remembered about the potion contest. Relizing that she must have
fallen asleep. A winged duck landed on her bed. Pepper looked at it in wonder
"QUACK", the duck asked Pepper. "You are too kind, but I have a potions 
event to attend", pepper replies to the duck. "Another time?", smiles 
Pepper. The duck flys off disapointed.
