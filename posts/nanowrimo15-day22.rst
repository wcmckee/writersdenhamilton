'What could be preping for?,' Vanessa wondered. She watches as Antony hands 
Detective a device. Then the footage stops. 'Damn it', Vanessa curses. 
Something happens that causes all the eletronic devices in the area to stop 
working. What they have created is a kill switch, even if they don't 
relize it. Vanessa stood up from her chair. The camera footage from now is useless.
She needs to find out what that substance was and how it brought Detective back to 
life. 

Detective agreed to the tasks that Antony had shown him on the paper. He didn't 
agree with them - they involved either killing or hurting innocent people - people 
that had no idea about their effect or generations after them effect on society. 
Steering at the list of names, dates and times, and event almost brought him to 
tears. He had to hold back his emotions. If Antony had any idea that he was fully 
consisious then he would be destoried. 

Vanessa had finished researching on the substance that Antony injected into 
Detectives brain - bringing him back to life. 
She stood in his surgery room. This was a hidden room in the palact that had a bunch
of terminal computers and a table for performing surgerys. There was suspession of 
something like this - but this was horrific. Humans had been going missing and 
Vanessa had just worked out what was happening - Antony was capturing them and 
performing surgery on them. He was using the computers along with the traditinal 
medical aplications. 

6b345 and Blitz had been assisting Antony in the lab. 6b345 had been riped to 
pieces when they spaceship blew up entering the Earth atmosphere. Bliz had died in
the accident. Vanessa had set the explosives on their ship to explode when it 
entered the Earths atmosphere. She hadn't expected it to blow up over the building
that she was attempting to smuggle Joey out of - leading to a quick escape.  It
happened though. 

robots and a cat. The strangest of lab assistences. 

On the wall was a framed painting of Loth'Rak. Vanessa could reconise him. Antony
looked very similar to him. Antony had more human features though. Loth'Rak was a 
full alien, welll Antony was only half.
