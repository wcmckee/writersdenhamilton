Over the past month I have been rereading the Harry Potter series of books by J.K Rowling. It is only the second time I have reread the books, though I have seen the films many times. 

This is a review on the series - what stood out, what didn't and my general feelings about the book.

Lets start with the first - Harry Potter and the philicious stone. 

This is the beginning where it all started. You can't say the first is the worse - though it doesn't standout to me as the best either. 

My least favorite is the 5th. I find very little parts of the book interesting. Harry is annoying, whinning brat though the majority of the book. Umbridge is my least favorite and the worse character in the series. There is no major plot developments. The only good points of the 5th book is Longbottoms parents and Hagrids Brother. Both quite minor considering the book is long. The length is another factor that makes it unpleasurable to read - it's too long with minimal interesting events. I managed to read the first four books non-stop without switching to a different book. I do like to switch between genres and authors so it's rare for me read a series without swithing to something else between books. It's not a hard read. 

In the third there is major plot developments with the escape of Wormtail. 

I'm still reading the 7th book. It's not going well and I don't like the fact there is no Hogwarts. The arguments between Ron and Harry is annoying. It's not as bad as the 5th book but still
