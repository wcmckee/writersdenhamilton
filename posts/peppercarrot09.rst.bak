Pepper and Carrot and Copyright

For sometime he had been searching for webcomics that could be remixed. The 
copyright works of Jem was remixed into new artworks but none of her comics
were taken into a writen form. Maybe something to explore? 

Through the site DeviantArt the webcomic Pepper&Carrot was discovered. This 
was instant inspration. Upfront he knew he could remix this as permission had
been granted in advance. If the works hadn't been under a Creative Commons 
licence then the remix wouldn't of happened. There is no way the artist whos
work is under copyright will be contacted and permission seeked to use the 
work.   

This is a novel about witches, technology, and copyright. It's a childrens
novel with fantasy, science fiction, and historic fiction infuence.  The 
fantasy comes from the witches world of hevena, science fiction for the 
copyright licences  and tech, historic fiction for creating a medievil world. 

Attempts have been made to keep true to the Pepper and Carrot universe. 
Excisting characters  and stories developed instead of fresh. This helps 
with linking the webcomic  with the  novel. Infucences have  also  been 
taken from FanFiction writing of Pepper&Carrot. 

A co-author would be fun to work work. Maybe  someone that will give a  basic
plot or  senerial and I  can expand  from there. This is why webcomic is an
excellent trigger. Able to write about images - colours, objects, chatacters,
envrioments - everything that is displayed in the webcomic  can be transfered
to text. 
 
Pepper had transformed her home. No longer was it empty with modem technology
but now devices were scatted around her home. Her main reason to use the 
tech was to improve her productivity of magic.

The spiders had decided of a one orb per orphan. It was a goal to get old orbs
refurnished and given to the orphans around Hevena that had nothing. 
The spiders ajusted his glasses with a twitch of  a nose. Out of the corner
of their eye they saw two figures enter the room. In the zone they didn't 
want to  be  distracted by intruders. Smashing the keys the bugs in the 
software  were removed. 

How people access information has radically changed. Until recently most of 
archival items weere largely unknown. Rich resource that includes photos,
newspapers,  oral histories and maps. Requests for resources that took up 
valuable staff time and "put people off using the images". Someone that leans
towards openness. Material coming in digital form only. Digitise the material
and let the doners keep the original. Building material with this system.
"Our focus  hasbeen on accessibility, rather than reuse. Releasing images of 
the collection for download is now a core part of the workflow of copyright 
assessment. Providing the  highest-resolution image file means wider scope 
for reuse. "Let's iterate!".
Start with what you  do now, at the bottom of the mountain. Don't worry at 
what's at the top. It might be solved on the trip, if it doesn't concentrate
better on solving at the top. 
Internal efficiency savings. New clearer opyright and open licensing  statements 
mean less confusion, less worry about inadvertently doing somethiing illegal,
and less time taken up processing rights requests and queries. Cut through the
copyright bureaucracy. 

Pepper wanted to become a IP and copyright witch. She would fight for justice
in the courts and side with witches that shared their creations. For too long
laws had sweep over them that didn't give them permission to share the resources
they were creating. There had been several reports of copyright infrengment
at the school. The outcome was the death of several witches - all by burning.
As they are being burnt the Hevena Copyright Law is read aloud to them. 
Not only are their last moments on the planet painful, they are also filled 
with lawyers preshing. After the final burning screams of the witches fade 
the final passage is read. "ALL RIGHTS RESERVED". 

Pepper had defencive security in place in case the ip and copyright police 
raided her. She had been recieving death threats over her latest potions. 
A large company was accusing Pepper of breaking patents. Pepper argued back
that like software spell and potion patents were wrong. She had been working
on getting spell and potion patents banned. 

It was copyright that first started the war between the two houses. One Earth
based and the other water. They accusiesed each other of copyright infrengment.
The whole case  went over the top. Billions of tax payers money was spent on 
fighting, countless lives on both sides were lost. The documents contained in
the parel being shipped  was trademark and bonds  shares of the world. 
Everything that a copyright logo could be attached to was in this file. It 
contained the meta data to all of pepper&carrot. 

The black and white C logo glowed brightly on the opening screen. It always 
appeared at this moment, much to Peppers frustration. It started it fade. 
At last it was time for Pepper and Carrot to enter the scene. Thosed with 
the logo Pepper and Carrot below their portrait. Both Pepper and Carrot had
large cleaming their  smiles. Both had shining white teeth - with Carrots
being extra sharp. The two held their pose at the scene contined. Next a 
range of stages would be setup. There were several choices. Peppers home. 
inside. bedroom. caultron. kormoda city. markets. shops. orphanage. 
contest statium. heIt was random what scene was going to happen. It could
be any of the choices - it depended on the scene. The whole show was improve.
Live actors with rough scripts - or guidelines. Nothing was truely planned
and the  actors were encourged to develop new story. 
The actress that played Pepper was recently replaced. There had been a terrible
accident and the actress had died. Whenever a actor dies they need to be  
replaced. Sometimes it can be hard to find a new actor. this time it was
easy. The company advertised the job on various actor message replied - and
got dozens of replies from young ladies  (and a few men) that believed they
would make a perfect Pepper actor. The interviews took time. Those that had
a high and low chance of the job were moved into the next process with all 
the middle thrown out.  

She had traveled with her Mother to the audition. They wanted to do it for the
experience, nothing else. It  was  a  nice Mother and daughter activity to do.
Audition for a television show. The company had thought about using lookalikes
for the actors but the  detail wasn't precise enough. They needed excact 
clones. The  company had been experiementing with cloning but it  had been
a failure. The funded was keeping the research alive. Scientists were able 
to study the process and release the results under a opene licenced document.
In the entrence foyer to the school a tv glared with sports playing. The 
sports were muted with light background music being played in the background.
It wasn't too loud and allowed people to hear each other and not boring as 
silence. There were options. Music pauses when someone speaker. This was 
popular amongst many. "GET OUT OF THE WAY", being yelled would be heard as 
the elevator jazz would be paused and the booming voice would enjected. 
There was a global channel that people were  in - off this were various
altenative channels. The system was built on the music genooue project. The
engine and data was open sourced and recieved a boost of contrubiters. 
At first they thought the project was going to fail but it was boosted to 
full health when the transistion to open source occured. 

The most merciful is the inability of the mind to correlate all its contents.
Living on a placid island of ignorance in the midsts of black seas of infinity.
This was not ment to voyage far. Sciences have hitherto harmed little
piecing together dissociated knowledge will open up terrifying vistas of 
reality and  frightful position stays. Go or flee to safety of new dark age.
Grandeur of the cosmic cycle. where worlds form transient incidents. freeze 
the blood if not masked by a bland optimism. Titan blocks and sky-flung 
monoliths. Dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror. 
chaotic snsation attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumple of
letters. Hybrid spawn were braying, bellowing, and writhing about a 
monsterous ring-shaped bonfire. 
In the  center stood a great granite monolith, of top of that a noxious carven
statuette. flame-grt monolith. Bodies of helpless squatters.
