House Elf Tower

Happy inside the house elf hadn't left their tower for months. Though they didn't miss the outside world. Being in the tower meant they were able to care for master. But poor master hadn't moved in weeks and the house elf was running out of food. Rations were created in order to preserve the little food that was left. Concern was rising about Master not moving. A regular sleeper for a long time but never slept this long without waking. The elf was  beginning to think there was something wrong with Master.
'sir wake up', the elf spoke shaking Master. He did not stir. Something must be done and the Elf attempted to pull Master from his armchair ad towards the bathroom. There he turned on the shower. Freezing cold water erupted from the nozzle. The With more force than before the Elf began shaking  Master in order to wake him up. It was no use. He wasn't waking up.
