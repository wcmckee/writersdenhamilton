ItWillBeMine and Detective together watched the camera footage.

Sarah and 6b345 stepped through the steel door at the landing pad. They had made it to Mars successfully. Sarah was now tasked with finding the
ships that had launched and landed on Mars and activating them. She was a little uneasy about 6b345. He original mission was to go to the Moon in 
order to find him as there were suspections that he had been hacked and was acting as a rogue robot. Could the friendly nature he was putting on 
just be show? 
6b345 scanned Sarah. The readings came up with an unusal high anxiety level. 'Are you feeling OK?', 6b345 asked Sarah as they walked down the 
hallways. 'Oh I'm fine', replied Sarah. She stopped holding her head. Sarah experienced a flash vision. It was a scene from Earth. She was with a 
man. Their arms were linked. They were standing outside a building door. Rain poured down. In the vision she knocks on the door twice and another
man - someone with a blured face lets them in. 
Sarah is brought back to relatey by 6b345. He slaps her accross the face which knocks her out of the flash. 'Sarah I don't think you are well', 
6b345 tells her. 'That was the strangest thing ever', Sarah explains. 'Come on, the sleeping bunkers are just up ahead', 6b345 tells Sarah. How
does he know so much about this facitiy Sarah thinks to herself. Her head still hurts but she continues down the hallway towards the sleeping 
bunkers. After everything that had happened, some sleep would be good.
