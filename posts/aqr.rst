Introduction 

By Matt McGregor, Public Lead, Creative Commons Aotearoa 
New Zealand 

A Kiwi Oppikirjamaraton 

In September 2012 a group of 30 Swedish maths enthusiasts 
got together for a Oppikirjamaraton. For non-Swedish speakers, 
this was a 'textbook marathon', in which volunteers wrote a 
secondary school mathematics textbook in a single weekend. 
The textbook was then released for free, under a Creative 
Commons licence, for anyone to adapt and reuse. 

Inspired by the Oppikirjamaraton, a group at the University 
of Otago Te Whare Wananga o Otago decided to follow suit and 
write their own textbook for undergraduate students of Media 
Studies. Erika Pearson, Senior Lecturer at Otago's Media, Film 
and Communication Department, spearheaded the project 
because, as she put it, "textbooks currently available for 
New Zealand first-year students are often produced overseas, 
usually the US, and can have a cripplingly high price tag. 

"Open texts are not only more affordable for students, they 
also are more flexible for teachers, who can pull apart open 
textbooks to find the more relevant and useful materials for 
their classes." 

And so, on the weekend of 16-17 November 2013, they 
began the Media Text Hack project: using the Pomodoro 
Technique and taking shifts of 25 minutes on, five minutes off, 
a group of lecturers and postgraduate students put together 
a textbook. Over the next few weeks, they filled any gaps left 
over from the weekend, and continued to edit the work. 



As Richard White, Manager Copyright and Open Access 
at the University of Otago, put it at the time, "This is a real 
21st-century textbook - I hesitate to even use that word - that 
harnesses the power of the web to break out of the print model 
we've had for the last several hundred years. It's Open Access, 
which means a lot of different things: it's free; anyone can read 
it, use it, adapt it; it's also open to wider scrutiny, which helps 
improve it over time." 

The textbook was quickly picked up by British Colombia 
Campus and accessed by users all over the world. In March 
2014, Erika then wrote the Cookbook, a how-to guide 
outlining the successes, failures and challenges of the Media 
Text Hack project. This, too, was made available under a 
Creative Commons licence. In 2015, the book became the 
official undergraduate textbook for a Media Studies course at 
the University of Otago, and has been used by students and 
educators around the world, from Canada to Cape Town. 

At first blush, the Media Text Hack project appears quite 
radical: it bypassed an established industry, that of textbook 
publishing; it embraced new methodologies; by utilising 
the energy of postgraduate and early career researchers, it 
circumvented conventional academic hierarchies around the 
production of teachable content; and, of course, it was released 
free of technical, price and legal restrictions on reuse. 

In the end, though, this Kiwi Oppikirjamaraton was 
fundamentally about a group of researchers and educators 
using existing technologies to create and share knowledge 
as widely as they possibly could - the core purpose of 



New Zealand's education institutions. In so doing, they will 
likely save thousands of students from buying expensive, 
closed-access textbooks. 

The Media Text Hack is one of many such projects. Taken 
at a global level, open textbook projects like this have the 
potential to save students worldwide many billions of dollars, 
and to also lead to better educational outcomes. According 
to the Student Public Interest Research Group in the United 
States, 65% of surveyed students choose not to buy a college 
textbook because it's too expensive, and 94% of these report 
that they suffer academically because of this choice. 

Figures such as these have led the United States' 
Department of Labor under the Obama administration to 
dedicate $2 billion in contestable funding to produce Open 
Educational Resources (OERs) for American community 
colleges, and have driven many other OER projects in nearly 
every country in the world. 

New Zealand's Quiet Revolutions 

Such projects depend on two twenty-first-century innovations: 
first, technologies that enable users to write, adapt and share 
educational resources; second, a global open licensing system 
that enables everyone on the planet to give and receive 
permission to use others' work in a clear and legally robust 
way. These innovations reduce or remove barriers to making 
and sharing culture and knowledge - and this, as we have 
seen from the Media Text Hack, allows for some truly exciting 
new projects. 



The second of these innovations, the licensing system 
known as Creative Commons (CC), is the focus of this book. 
At its core, Creative Commons is a suite of six copyright 
licences (remember, 'licence' just means 'way to give 
permission'). Creative Commons licence users can choose to 
restrict commercial reuse and derivative works; they can also 
choose to require derivative works to use Creative Commons 
licensing. All Creative Commons licences require those who 
copy licensed works to provide attribution. 

There are some additional legal details in the licences, 
but that's a good chunk of what you need to know. The core 
concepts of the Creative Commons licences - Attribution, Non 
Commercial, No Derivatives and Share Alike - are designed 
to be easy to understand and to use. We've included more 
information, as well as a handy chart, at the end of this book. 

But why publish a book? While at the 2011 Foo Camp, 
Jez Weston, then Policy Analyst at the Royal Society of 
New Zealand, referred to a ''quiet revolution taking place 
in the way we use, generate and transfer knowledge". As 
this book will show, we are living through many such 'quiet 
revolutions', with implications for how all New Zealanders 
access and engage with our culture and knowledge. 

Opening All the Things 

New technologies and licences have enabled projects like the 
Oppikirjamaraton and the Media Text Hack, not to mention the 
thousands of other open textbook projects worldwide. But what 




about research? What about data? What about government 
reports, culture and heritage works, music, art and literature? 

Each of these areas has its own challenges and 
opportunities. In New Zealand schools, for example, teachers 
do not own the copyright to resources they produce in the 
course of their employment (a consequence of section 21.2 of 
the 1994 Copyright Act). We believe that this means schools 
- all 2,500 of them in New Zealand - should adopt Creative 
Commons policies to allow for greater resource sharing among 
the teaching profession. 

Another example comes from the wonderfully acronymed 
GLAM sector (that's galleries, libraries, archives and museums). 
Our heritage institutions rarely own copyright to the works 
they hold. As a result, there is a focus in the heritage sector 
on opening up more out-of-copyright works and encouraging 
donors of newer works to provide more liberal permissions. 

In the research sector, the business model of scholarly 
publishing and the reliance on prestige and reputation in 
academia have proved to be major barriers to Open Access 
to publicly funded research. The good news is that several 
New Zealand universities - joining their international 
counterparts - have adopted Open Access policies, allowing 
for free public access to academic research. 

As these examples suggest, some of the greatest 
opportunities to open New Zealand's culture and knowledge 
are in the state sector, which holds and owns vast amounts 
of copyright works. Think of all the schools, universities. 




polytechnics, libraries, archives, galleries, museums, government 
departments, research institutes and crown-owned companies 
- the social, cultural and economic benefits of making these 
works openly available are truly massive. 

What’s the NZGOAL? 

This potential has been recognised by Cabinet, who, in 2010, 
approved the New Zealand Government Open Access and 
Licensing framework (NZGOAL). NZGOAL advocates for 
the use of Creative Commons licensing for public sector data 
and information. 

NZGOAL is a great piece of policy that has the potential 
to open up millions of government-funded works. Essentially, 
NZGOAL either directs or strongly encourages agencies that 
produce or fund copyright works to consider making that work 
available using Creative Commons open copyright licensing. 

It's fair to say that it will take some time to fully implement 
NZGOAL: the state sector is large, complex and can face 
competing priorities. But the open community is making real 
progress, and we have already seen many exciting and world- 
leading open releases. 

One early adopter of NZGOAL is the Ministry for Culture 
and Heritage Manatu Taonga, which has made its popular 
national encyclopedia Te Ara available under a Creative 
Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) licence, 
meaning anyone can copy and repurpose its works without 
asking the Ministry for permission. 




Another leading agency is Land Information New Zealand 
Toitu Te Whenua (LINZ), which has released truly massive 
open datasets to its award-winning LINZ Data Service (LDS). 
LDS allows anyone to view and 'layer' multiple datasets 
in their web browser. Some of the more popular datasets 
include high-resolution aerial photography of the entire 
country and aerial photography of Christchurch after the 
2011 earthquakes. 

A range of datasets from other agencies, including Statistics 
New Zealand Tatauranga Aotearoa and the New Zealand 
Transport Agency Waka Kotahi (NZTA), have also been 
released rmder an open Creative Commons licence, and have 
been put to use in a range of useful and fascinating projects. 
ANZ Bank, for example, used NZTA transport data to 
produce the 'ANZ Truckometer', which used traffic flows on 
New Zealand state highways to predict movements in Gross 
Domestic Product. 

Another more prosaic example is the use of LINZ tide data. 
The release of this data under a Creative Commons Attribution 
licence enabled a range of developers to produce apps for 
both iPhone and Android devices, including NZ Tides Pro, 
NZTides, Tideplan, Tide Prediction and Quicktide. 

It’s Time to Save Time 

Open data, though, is not only about new products; it's also 
about saving time and money. Open data ensures, in the first 
place, that datasets produced by agency X aren't duplicated 




by agency Y. (Believe it or not, government agencies haven't 
always been great at sharing data and information.) 

It also makes it easier for users to access and reuse data. 
For professionals in data-intensive fields, this allows them to 
do their job more easily; for citizens looking to access data, this 
reduces the cost (in time, money and stress) of requesting data 
from public agencies. 

The experience of Wellington City Council (WCC) bears 
this out. While council data - such as aerial photography, 
contours, parks, pipes, windzones and walkways - has always 
been available to ratepayers, in the past the process required 
both a specific request and a processing fee. According to WCC 
staff, this would lead to several data requests per week, with 
council staff having to manually extract data each time. 

This wasn't, as you might expect, a super-efficient use 
of time for either tire Council or the public and the numbers 
suggest that the process was putting off many potential users. 
After releasing their data openly, the numbers increased 
exponentially, with several datasets receiving over 10,000 
downloads since their 2010 release. 

While it can be hard to quantify these sorts of efficiency gains, 
it's easy to see how the release of open data and content can save 
time and money across New Zealand society. Looking beyond 
open data, think of 100,000 teachers looking for educational 
resources, publishers looking for images, researchers looking 
for research (and research data), artists looking for creative 
works to adapt and build on, and any other New Zealander 
who wants to use or access copyright materials. 



From Making Open to Open Making 

Some of the most innovative uses of Creative Commons 
licensing are in the maker community - that is, the community 
of people that like to use new technologies like 3D printers to, 
well, make stuff. One interesting example of this happened 
in 2014 when the Canterbury Spatial Data Infrastructure 
Programme, managed by LINZ, released 3D images of 
Christchurch before the earthquakes under a Creative 
Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence. 

Under the terms of this licence anyone could copy, adapt 
and recreate a replica of tire 36 'core city blocks' and four 
'outer CBD blocks' of pre-earthquake Christchurch. LINZ 
Chief Executive Peter Mersi says, "A benefit of the open licence 
means that anyone can download and improve the models, 
and use them in a range of ways to celebrate the heritage that 
has been lost." 

The folks at LINZ aren't the only people thinking about open 
licensing in the built environment. One of the most exciting 
projects to be developed under Creative Commons licensing so 
far is WikiHouse, a global Open Source hardware project that 
enables anyone to "design, download and 'print' CNC-milled 
houses and components, which can be assembled with minimal 
formal skill or training". 

The New Zealand chapter of WikiHouse was formed after 
the 2011 Canterbury earthquakes as a way to make the rebuild 
more efficient and sustainable. As Martin Luff and Danny 
Squires, founders of the New Zealand WikiHouse project, 
point out, "A lot of people down here in Canterbury are stuck 



in limbo because they are dependent on a whole hierarchy of 
other agencies before they can get on with things like repairs 
and replacement housing. 

“We wanted to empower people. We wanted it to be world- 
class in terms of its ability to stand up to seismic resistance. 
We also wanted it, longer term, to go beyond sustainability to 
something that could be restorative to our environment." 

Another fascinating example from the world of making is 
Bronwyn Hollo way-Smith, a Wellington-based artist interested 
in "internet culture, 3-dimensional printing, open source art, 
and space colonisation". In 2012, Bronwyn participated in 'The 
Obstinate Object', a multi-artist exhibition at Wellington's City 
Gallery. As part of this show, Bronwyn created digital files of 
other works in the exhibition and printed small 3D replicas, 
which she added to the exhibition. She then posted the files 
on Thingiverse under a Creative Commons Attribution- 
NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) licence, for 
anyone to download and print for themselves. 

Since uploading the files to Thingiverse, many of the files 
have over 3,000 views, with one work - 'After Glen Hayward's 
Open Circuit (Security Camera)’ - receiving over 750 downloads. 

Another Kiwi project came from the 2013 Mix &amp; Mash 
competition. The winner of this competition, Graeme Jenson, 
produced an online mihimihi that traced his whakapapa 
(or genealogy) back to the birth of humanity, reusing and 
repurposing images and information from the National Library 
of New Zealand Te Puna Matauranga o Aotearoa, DigitalNZ 
A-tihi o Aotearoa and Papers Past along the way. 



Professor Lawrence Lessig - one of the founders of Creative 
Commons and the 2013 judge for Mix &amp; Mash - concluded that 
"there is something impossibly difficult about the telescoping 
nature of the story this tries to tell, and the combination of the 
two perspectives - the timeline and then video - to create a 
powerful impression." 

Artists and Creators 

Creative Commons licensing is also used by more conventional 
artists, including writers, photographers, musicians and 
filmmakers. Why would they do such a thing? Reasons vary. 
Some use Creative Commons to expand their audience by 
removing the legal barriers to others' copying and sharing 
their work. This allows them to make better use of the internet 
and digital technologies to increase their audience and profile. 
Others use Creative Commons because they are committed 
to growing the Commons. And some artists also use Creative 
Commons because it supports the business model for their 
creative work. 

Consider Meena Kadri. A long-time user of Flickr (under 
the name Meanest Indian), Meena releases many of her photos 
under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial- 
NoDerivatives (CC BY-NC-ND) licence. Her most popular set 
of photos - on the Uttarayan Kite Festival, India - has received 
over 50,000 views. Other popular sets include 'Indian Street 
Art' (over 40,000 views), 'Back View Bollywood' (nearly 25,000 
views) and 'Faces of India' (over 19,000 views). 

Given the popularity of her Flickr account, her images 



have featured in countless blogs and presentations. For-profit 
companies have also paid to use her work, including Serendib, 
the magazine of Sri Lankan Airlines, and Phaidon Books, who 
included ten of her images in an Indian cookbook. 

Other artists using Creative Commons licensing include 
novelist and critic Thomasin Sleigh, who released her (print- 
only) novel Ad Lib under a Creative Commons Attribution 
-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) licence; 
musicians Richard White, Disasteradio and Jon Lemmon; 
illustrators Judith Carnaby and Jem Yoshioka; and cartoonist 
Dylan Horrocks. 

Dylan Horrocks points out that Creative Commons 
provides him with an alternative to what he sees as a narrow, 
but dominant, vision of culture and art. "When I make a piece 
of art, it's me responding to a whole lot of art and the world 
around me. When I finish it, I want it to go back into that flow 
of art and ideas, and be shared and responded to by people. 
Treating it as a single piece of property seems wrong. Lots of 
people have a relationship to that piece of art." 

The great thing about Creative Commons licences is that 
you don't need to ask anyone's permission to use them. This 
means that there are many, many more artists out there using 
Creative Commons that, as an organisation, we haven't heard 
of. In fact, according to information collected by the National 
Library of New Zealand, over 8% of music collected by the 
library under legal deposit has a Creative Commons licence. 




Creative Commons in New Zealand 

All this has happened rather quickly. Danyl Strype, a keen 
Open Source advocate, had helped set up the CC-NZ email list 
in October 2005, from which grew an enthusiastic community 
of open licence advocates. One result of these lively discussions 
was that Adam Hyde registered the creativecommons.org. 
nz domain. Then there was a large meeting at the National 
Library in Wellington about the Creative Commons project 
in 2006. Soon after that meeting, Dr Brian Opie - then Senior 
Lecturer in the Department of English at Victoria University of 
Wellington Te Whare Wananga o te Upoko o te Ika a Maui, and 
Executive Director of the Council for the Humanities - signed 
a memorandum of understanding with Creative Commons 
Headquarters, officially launching Creative Commons 
Aotearoa New Zealand (CCANZ) under the umbrella of the 
Council. 

After the meeting at the National Library, Jane Hornibrook 
was hired to help manage tire project on a day-to-day basis, and 
began advocating for the use of Creative Commons licensing 
across tire country. 

So, we had a project, but we didn't yet have any licences. At 
that point, the latest international Creative Commons licences, 
version 3.0, had been drafted by lawyers in the United States, 
which made them more complicated (and less readable) than 
they needed to be for New Zealand. To help address this 
problem, Brian made contact with a lawyer, Andrew Matangi, 
who happened to work with Brian's son. Andrew worked 




to 'port' the licences to New Zealand, building on the plain 
English efforts of lawyers in England, Scotland and Wales. 
And so, at the end of 2007, Creative Commons Aotearoa 
New Zealand launched its local 3.0 licences. 

Around this time, some people in the State Services 
Commission were looking into the possibility of using Creative 
Commons licensing for government data and information, 
following on the heels of similar work being done in Australia 
and the UK. After a long period of consultation, Cabinet 
approved NZGOAL. 

NZGOAL was followed in 2011 with the Declaration on 
Open and Transparent Government, which strengthened and 
supported the mandate for agencies to use NZGOAL. 

While this was happening, CCANZ followed the Council 
for the Humanities into the Royal Society of New Zealand in 
June 2010, where the project was housed for the next four years, 
with funding from the Ministry for Research, Science and 
Technology Te Manatu Putaiao (as it was then called). Around 
this time, the CCANZ formed its Advisory Panel, to ensure that 
the project meets the needs of its various constituent groups, 
and to provide strategic advice. 

The latest changes happened in July 2014, when CCANZ 
shifted to the Open Education Resource Foundation (OERF), 
based out of Otago Polytechnic. While CCANZ remains 
based in Wellington, the OERF provides governance and 
administrative support. Thanks to the OERF, CCANZ is in 
great health, with many exciting projects in the works. 




Towards an Indigenous Knowledge Notice 

In July 2015, CCANZ translated the Creative Commons 4.0 
licences into New Zealand's first language, te reo Maori. 
Now, with tire translation complete, CCANZ is looking to 
help individuals or groups - such as iwi or hapu - who wish 
to make their works more accessible. Creative Commons is 
planning to develop a standard notice that would provide 
basic information on how the work is to be used. 

As many indigenous peoples have long argued, copyright 
is not always an effective legal framework for indigenous 
knowledge. This is partly because copyright protection on a 
work lasts for a limited period of time, after which the work 
enters the public domain, where it can be accessed and reused 
by anyone - which may not be culturally appropriate. 

The age of many indigenous works, which may be very old, 
means that their copyright will have long expired. Also, many 
indigenous works do not have a single identifiable author. 
Instead, such works may be collectively authored, and may 
have been incrementally created over tire course of several 
generations. 

Without any legal protections, and without any standard 
notice, indigenous works that might otherwise be openly 
available are currently closed. CCANZ hopes that a notice will 
give the kaitiaki of indigenous works the option of making 
their work more openly available, where the kaitiaki consider 
this to be appropriate. 




Growing the Global Commons 

One of the great things about the Commons is that it, like 
copyright, is international. This means that everything 
Kiwi artists share under a Creative Commons licence is 
automatically shared with the world. By the same token, this 
means that everything the world shares under a Creative 
Commons licence is automatically shared with us. 

The good news for Aotearoa is that we're not the only ones 
embracing open licensing: it's happening everywhere. There 
are Creative Commons affiliate projects like ours in over 70 
countries, all with their own priorities and challenges, and 
all with their own exciting releases of great openly licensed 
content and data. A conservative estimate suggests that 
between 800 million and one billion openly licensed works are 
already available under a Creative Commons licence, with this 
number sure to grow rapidly in the years ahead. 

There are far too many exciting international projects to 
discuss in this short introduction, but some of my favourites 
include: Reijksmuseum, Project LATin, TACCCT Grants, NIH 
OA policy, Leicester Schools OER, OER Poland, BC Campus 
and Open Seoul. 

Join the Revolution 

This is all very exciting but we still have a long way to go. We 
want the takeaway message from this book to be not so much 
"look at these cool projects" as "why aren't these cool projects 
happening everywhere?" While there are valid reasons for some 
works to remain closed, such as privacy concerns or commercial 



interests, it is more often the case that works remain closed 
simply because nobody thought they could be otherwise. 

We at Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand are 
playing our small part by making it easier for institutions 
and organisations - including schools, universities, archives, 
libraries and more - to adopt Creative Commons policies, in 
order to make open licensing standard practice. 

But creating lasting change in the ways New Zealanders 
can access and reuse their culture and knowledge requires 
champions. We need people to make sure that Creative 
Commons is always considered before any organisation, 
but particularly those that receive public funding, releases a 
copyright work. 

This is where you come in. We want Kiwis interested in 
helping grow the Commons to champion Creative Commons 
in their local communities and publicly funded organisations. 
This includes your local school, council, polytech, library, 
museum, archive, gallery, academic department, research 
institute or government agency. 

You don't need to ask our permission to champion CC, but 
we are here to help out. We've developed a heap of resources 
in each of our target sectors, and can let you know how 
you can contribute to our collective efforts. You'll be joining 
thousands of New Zealanders already using or advocating for 
Creative Commons licensing, helping to grow the Commons 
in Aotearoa. 




Open GLAM 

(Galleries, Libraries, 
Archives and Museums) 



Reflecting on Open GLAiis in 
Aotearoa New Zealand 

By Thomasin Sleigh, Community Manager, and Fiona Fieldsend, 
Manager, DigitalNZ A-tihi o Aotearoa 

It is redundant to say now, in 2015, that digital technologies 
offer amazing opportunities as well as tricky problems for 
galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAMs). How 
people access information has radically changed, as has 
society's expectations of GLAMs. When making material 
available online, licensing is a ubiquitous question that the 
sector circles around. Open GLAM is a set of proposals: the 
use of Creative Commons (CC) licences, the public domain 
and other less restrictive rights statements to allow for easy 
access and the active reuse of cultural collections. 

The Open GLAM discussion started to formally take 
shape in May 2002 at the inaugural National Digital Forum 
(NDF) conference. Here, open access to online information, 
transparency about copyright and intellectual property 
issues, indigenous rights, and the concept that copyright law 
must also strike a balance between the rights of owners and 
the legitimate needs of the users of copyright works were 
all firmly put on the table. Open GLAM was then formally 
kickstarted in 2003 by the World Summit on the Information 
Society Declaration of Principles and Commitment. At 
this event in Geneva, the principle that "information and 
communication technology (ICT) should enable anyone 
and everyone to have instantaneous access to knowledge 



and information" was ratified. New Zealand GLAMs deftly 
summarised this as "information democracy" and it became 
a core theme in strategic planning across the sector. 

With that principle in hand, tire National Library of 
New Zealand Te Puna Matauranga o Aotearoa took the lead on 
the development of the content section of the 2005 New Zealand 
Digital Strategy. The key goal: "To unlock New Zealand's stock 
of content and provide all New Zealanders with seamless, 
easy access to the information that is important to their lives, 
businesses and cultural identity." 

Alongside this, the National Library publicly supported 
the emerging Creative Commons concept and fostered 
discussions with a range of experts on the need for Creative 
Commons licences to be adapted to the New Zealand legislative 
environment. 

In 2006, the National Library brought together organisations 
from across the sector for a national information meeting and 
workshop. As mentioned on the Creative Commons listserv, 
the National Library hosted "because they are committed, as 
part of the draft digital content strategy, to investigate the 
feasibility of setting up a Creative Commons for Aotearoa." 
This Digital Content Strategy was published in 2007. "Creating 
A Digital New Zealand: New Zealand's Digital Content 
Strategy" included the outcome "Digital content is being 
shared and used" and highlighted the challenges of unlocking 
publicly owned content, strengthening the public domain and 
creating a connected public digital Commons. 




These two documents, the Digital Strategy and the Content 
Strategy, as well as the introduction of Creative Commons 
in New Zealand, all raised the level of discourse about the 
digital Commons, use and reuse, and the public domain across 
the GLAM sector. However, opening up content for reuse 
remains challenging for GLAMs. Over the years. New Zealand 
institutions have raised and worked through complex issues: 
the protection of indigenous rights, existing donor agreements, 
revenue requirements of image collections, and orphan works, 
to name a few. 

The New Zealand Electronic Text Centre Te Puhikotuhi o 
Aotearoa was one of the earliest GLAM adopters of Creative 
Commons licensing: in 2008 it chose Creative Commons 
licensing on the digital surrogates of the digitised texts 
published on its website. Soon after, NZ On Screen launched, 
and applied Creative Commons licences to, its Screentalk 
interviews. The National Library was one of the early 
contributors to Flickr Commons with a collection of no known 
copyright materials launched in November 2008. Following 
this, the open source Kete Community Repository built Creative 
Commons licensing into its upload workflow for new materials. 

It was also in 2008 that DigitalNZ A-tihi o Aotearoa 
launched. Funded as a result of the Digital Content Strategy, 
DigitalNZ sought to make New Zealand digital content 
easier to find, share and use. It started out by prototyping, 
testing and showcasing new ways of doing things with 
digital content. One such prototype was the Memory Maker, 




launched in conjunction with the Auckland War Memorial 
Museum Tamaki Paenga Hira, which allowed people to make 
their own videos using a selection of materials from a range 
of collecting institutions. Participating organisations therefore 
had to provide copyright-free digital items; for some, it was the 
first time they had made collections items specifically available 
for reuse. 

DigitalNZ's core work was an aggregated search of 
collections, primarily GLAMs at first, to provide a one-stop 
shop for New Zealand digital content. DigitalNZ developed 
a licence schema that made it possible to filter search results 
by rights, and developed the Use and Reuse Guide as part of a 
suite of Make It Digital best practice guidance. 

DigitalNZ launched the Mix &amp; Mash competition in 2010, 
aiming to "show what is possible when a public agency, a 
library, a scientist or a museum gives you permission to use 
their copyright works. We want to increase the amount of 
open content and data out there, and your stories help us 
show why it's worth doing!" The competition challenged 
students, creatives and developers to use openly licensed 
digital content and data to make new artworks, resources 
and tools. Winners ranged from an illustrative re-working 
of a Katherine Mansfield poem that drew inspiration from 
GLAM pictorial collections to a Great New Zealand Walks 
smartphone application that included content from a variety of 
GLAM institutions. Collaborating with other institutions and 
like-minded sponsors, Mix &amp; Mash ran again in 2011 and 2013, 




and received many inventive, funny and surprising entries that 
reused open material from collections across New Zealand. 

Conversations around licensing, the public domain and 
heritage institutions continued in a number of fora including 
the annual NDF conferences. 2009's conference hosted a 'Fair 
Use Forum', chaired by the late Paul Reynolds, with participants 
from the National Library, the Creative Freedom Foundation 
and the Digital Publishing Forum. Successive NDFs have all 
included similar panels and presentations, and have provided 
a space for cross-sector discussion about copyright, access, and 
the reuse of collections. 

Alongside all this talk was some exciting activity: a 
growing number of GLAM institutions adopting Creative 
Commons and open licences. Palmerston North City Library, 
Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tamaki and Auckland Libraries 
Nga Whare Matauranga o Tamaki Makaurau were some of the 
first organisations to apply 'no known copyright' statements 
to relevant items in their digital collections. Later, Archives 
New Zealand Te Rua Mahara o te Kawanatanga uploaded 
digitised footage from the National Publicity Studios, and 
they applied the Creative Commons licence that is supported 
by YouTube. When Upper Hutt City Library launched their 
RECOLLECT site of digitised archival material, the majority 
of the collection was licensed under a Creative Commons 
Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) licence. 

The development of Open GLAM in New Zealand was 
considerably bolstered by the release of the New Zealand 




Government Open Access and Licensing policy (NZGOAL) 
in 2010. NZGOAL explicitly states that "opening up this 
information for reuse has considerable and widespread 
benefits to government, industry and the public" and added 
governmental heft to the argument for publicly funded cultural 
institutions to openly license their material, and acknowledge 
where content is out of copyright. For example, NZGOAL was 
a significant factor in the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa 
Tongarewa's November 2010 decision to adopt the 'no known 
copyright restriction' statement and Creative Commons 
Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (CC BY-NC-ND) 
licence for digital surrogates of collection items displayed in 
its Collections Online. 

2014 was an important year for Creative Commons and the 
Open GLAM movement in New Zealand. The National Library 
launched its Reuse Policy, which laid out a clear framework 
for identifying out-of-copyright material and explicitly 
advocated for the use of Creative Commons licences in its third 
principle: "Negotiations with rights owners and donors will 
promote and be informed by the Creative Commons licensing 
framework as a mechanism to facilitate use and reuse of in- 
copyright works." 

In mid-2014, tire WW100 Office, prompted by the Ministry 
for Culture and Heritage Manatu Taonga's Copyright and the 
Cultural Sector meeting, coordinated consistent licensing of 
tire H Series, the official World War One photographs taken by 
Henry Armytage Sanders, across several institutions that hold 




that collection. Also in mid-2014, Te Papa removed the resolution 
restrictions and enabled high-resolution download on over 30,000 
no known copyright and CC BY-NC-ND images. 

Where does this leave New Zealand's Open GLAM 
movement in 2015? Importantly, New Zealand now has a 
number of best practice examples, from both large and small 
institutions, for other GLAMs to emulate in opening up their 
collections. In particular, Te Papa, as New Zealand's national 
museum and art gallery, has been transparent, through a series 
of blog posts and the release of a data set on image download 
statistics, about tracking the impact of their image release. 
They are reporting their research back to the sector. 

Perhaps more significantly, the proliferating activity of 
digital communities points to innovative and unexpected uses 
of heritage material, and the new demands that audiences have 
of GLAM institutions: popular Facebook pages sharing archival 
images, Photoshop experts colourising WWI photographs 
and GIF-makers remixing old paintings. Responding to this. 
Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand has worked 
with GLAMs on useful tools such as a guide for donors and 
depositors to cultural institutions, and an off-the-shelf reuse 
policy for institutions to adapt and adopt. 

It has been a busy 12 years of Open GLAM in Aotearoa 
New Zealand, and the movement continues to build 
momentum. Complex issues remain, such as the protection 
of indigenous rights and balancing the sometimes competing 
interests of other stakeholders. However, as increasing 




numbers of institutions put concerted effort into identifying 
and releasing collections that are legally and ethically able to 
be openly licensed, and showcasing the value of this work, 
the Open GLAM movement can only continue to strengthen 
and grow. 




Marsden Online Archive 
at the Hocken Library 

The University of Otago Library Nga Whare Whakamarama 
o Te Whare Wananga o Otago has an online archive that for 
the first time allows researchers to search and mine Samuel 
Marsden's historic journals and letters with technological 
online tools. The documents, detailing life on the nation's 
first missions, were brought back from London more than a 
century ago by Thomas Hocken and have been transcribed by 
retired Associate Professor Gordon Parsonson. 

As reported on the Marsden Archive website: "This was a 
collaborative project undertaken by the University of Otago 
Library and the University's Centre for Research on Colonial 
Culture. This project to create the Marsden Online Archive set 
out to achieve a number of objectives including: 

• creating digital objects from historically significant, 
unique items in the Hocken Collections; 

• providing appropriate metadata for these resources, 
so as to enrich contextual information and extend 
discoverability; 

• identifying and deploying appropriate technical and 
discovery standards to ensure accessibility, preservation 
and curation; and 

• developing an appropriate platform, structure and web 
interface to make the collections useful as a research 




asset. 



Vanessa Gibbs, Business Analyst and Mining Marsden 
Project Manager at the University of Otago Library, speaks 
about the use of Creative Commons in the Mining Marsden 
Project: "The Project Sponsor for the Marsden Online Archive 
was already familiar with Creative Commons licensing. He 
recommended the use of the Attribution-NonCommercial- 
ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) New Zealand licence to Gordon 
Parsonson (the copyright owner of the transcripts). We chose 
that particular licence because we wanted to make sure 
Gordon would continue to get attribution for his work, but 
we didn't want to stop other researchers being able to build 
upon the material. 

"From there it was an easy decision to use the same 
agreement for the digital images and metadata. The Creative 
Commons licence structure provides a clear and easily 
understood framework for the application of copyright 
licences. It was easy for us to apply the licence and it is easy for 
our users to understand the terms under which they can use 
the material. 

"As we are using the same licence for both the transcripts 
and the images and metadata, we have set up a Terms of Use 
webpage. Here we detail when Gordon needs to be attributed 
and when the Hocken Collections need to be attributed. This 
way there is no confusion for our users. 

"We've had really great buy-in from staff on tire Marsden 
Online Archive. They are now more open to using a Creative 
Commons licence for other material. I guess they see Marsden 




as a test case for using a Creative Commons licence and so far 
it has been very successful. 

"There are already a number of other projects that Library 
staff are discussing using Creative Commons licensing for. 
Hopefully the success of the Marsden Online Archive will 
highlight the usefulness of the Creative Commons licensing 
framework." 




RECOLLECT: Upper Hutt City Library 

In 201 2, Upper Hutt City Library (UHCL) launched RECOLLECT, 
an online repository of materials from its community archive. 
The announcement made the front page of the Upper Hutt Leader, 
where it was celebrated as “a New Zealand first". 

The RECOLLECT platform allows users to browse and 
discuss archival materials. At present, the site has over 21,000 
photos and hundreds of other items freely available to access 
and download. 

What was not mentioned in the Leader story, however, was 
perhaps RECOLLECT's most remarkable feature: nearly all 
its heritage items - old and new - are made available under a 
Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) or Creative Commons 
Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) licence. 

The Upper Hutt Community Archive was created in 1996 to 
host heritage materials from the local community. It has grown 
into a rich resource for local residents and includes thousands 
of photos, newspapers, oral histories and maps. 

Until recently most of these archival items were largely 
unknown. Members of the public would have to request copies, 
and would be charged an administrative fee by the UHCL. As 
UHCL Archivist Reid Perkins points out, this took up valuable 
staff time and tended to "put people off using the images". 

RECOLLECT allows users to download images from 
UHCL's archive whenever they like. Reid says, "This has been a 
popular feature. People like the fact that they have easy access to 
these images, which of course if we were using a traditional All 



Rights Reserved copyright model we wouldn't be able to do." 

Reid came to the RECOLLECT project in May 2012, and says 
he was "very impressed" with the library's attitude towards 
sharing and reuse. "A lot of institutions are quite risk averse. I 
was very pleased to come here and see that they didn't seem to 
have that attitude." 

In partnership with New Zealand Micrographic Services 
Ltd, library staff agreed that the Creative Commons licences fit 
with the general ethos of the archive. Their remarkable range 
of openly licensed resources includes collections of the Upper 
Hutt Leader itself. 

Reid admits that the question of rights has given him 
some nervous nights, but that most people seem to be willing 
to allow the public to access and share their local heritage. 
"There does seem to be a good, positive attitude here. The 
main feeling seems to be that people are proud of their local 
history and want it better known. They want people to access 
their images." 

Reid points to the collection of photos by Revelle Jackson, 
a prominent Hutt Valley photographer. Jackson was the 
official photographer for local events - including A&amp;P shows, 
birthday parties and weddings - for several decades, and his 
collection of over 8,000 photos is now available for download 
for distribution and reuse under a Creative Commons 
Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) licence. 

When asked about other libraries following in the footsteps 
of UHCL, Reid points out that most libraries and archives are 
caught between two basic mandates: to protect the collections 



and to provide access. While Reid understands the dilemmas 
many librarians and archivists face, he says he's "pleased to be 
working in a place where it does seem to lean tire other way, 
towards openness". 

Reid says that he would "definitely encourage other 
institutions to go down this route". 

For smaller, regional organisations, open access and open 
licensing are a good way to encourage the local community 
to share and reuse heritage materials. "Our issue is getting 
people to use the stuff, providing access so that people use our 
collections. As soon as we are fairly sure that there aren't any 
copyright claims, we want to put the work in circulation." 

As local groups continue to donate materials to the archive, 
Reid looks forward to growing RECOLLECT. "A lot of material 
is coming in digital form only. We often digitise the material, 
and let the donors keep the original. We're building up a lot of 
material like that." 

As the collections grow, so does the range of materials 
available for sharing and creative reuse. "I've been getting 
donors' permission to use their material digitally, and this 
includes Creative Commons licensing. I make a point of telling 
people, because they might be worried or misunderstand, but 
no one seems that concerned. They want their images to be out 
there and available. 

"I've always made an effort to explain the licences to 
donors, and no one's been bothered so far, to be honest. So far, 
everyone's agreed." 




Te Papa Joins the Commons 

People at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa 
have been thinking about Creative Commons licensing for a 
while now. As our national museum, Te Papa is the kaitiaki 
of an incredible range of artistic, scientific and cultural items, 
including paintings, photos, objects, specimens articles and 
over 30,000 Taonga Maori. 

A decade ago these collections were difficult for most 
New Zealanders to access, especially for those who lived 
outside of Wellington. Since then the team at Te Papa has 
been working on digitising their collection of over two 
million items. In 2005, after years of work, Te Papa launched 
Collections Online, a search engine for Te Papa's collections; it 
was relaunched in its current format in 2009. 

Before any item can be reproduced online, the team at 
Te Papa have to figure out whether they have the right to 
do so. This can be an arduous process. As a result, Victoria 
Leachman, Rights Advisor at Te Papa, says, "Our focus at 
Te Papa has been on accessibility, rather than reuse." 

The result is an outstanding digital archive, consisting of 
over 200,000 objects. This is a fantastic resource for students, 
researchers and members of the public. 

In a digital environment, however, many visitors to 
Te Papa's collections want to share, remix and reuse the images 
and data they find. Recognising this, Victoria and her team 
have been steadily applying Creative Commons licences to 




thousands of items. The team has been "nibbling away at the 
edges of the collections". 

In 2008, as an initial experiment with open licensing, 
Te Papa applied a Creative Commons licence to 21 audio 
guides for its 'Rita Angus: Life and Vision' exhibition. 

Since then, applying Creative Commons licences has been 
a work in progress. Because Te Papa doesn't always own the 
copyright to its collections, the process of giving Creative 
Commons licences can be complex. The team at Te Papa has 
spent years researching the copyright on its images. 

Te Papa itself also produces a vast amount of material. 
These images have been easier to license: so far, thousands 
of images in its Natural Environment Collections have been 
given a Creative Commons licence. Thousands of other works 
have been labelled 'no known copyright restrictions', which 
lets users know that to the knowledge of Te Papa, the work has 
fallen into the public domain. 

The team has already seen some exciting example of reuse, 
including posts in Dr David Winter's The Atavism, hosted by 
Sciblogs. 

Other works from Te Papa can be found in its Flickr 
stream. Te Papa also holds the copyright to a few of the 
objects in its art collections, allowing it to participate in the 
Google Art Project. 

In addition to its images and artworks, Te Papa produces 
a vast amount of original research. Like other organisations, 
Te Papa is confronting the trend towards Open Access. In 
2011 researchers from Te Papa published a paper in Scientific 



Reports on the "slime defence mechanism" of the Hagfish. The 
researchers licensed the paper Creative Commons Attribution- 
NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (CC BY-NC-ND), and made it 
available on Nature.com. 

They also released, as the press release put it, "graphic 
underwater footage showing for the first time how the 
primitive hagfish - also known as the snot-eel - defends itself 
by emitting a choking, gill-clogging slime." Because both the 
paper and the footage were available under an open licence, 
the findings were covered by news organisations like TVNZ 
and Stuff. co. nz. 

There are also issues of moral rights, cultural rights and 
'orphan works' - those works that are still under copyright 
but that have no obvious copyright owner. Victoria and others 
at Te Papa are working on addressing these issues, while 
respecting the rights of those who donate their collections. 

Te Papa has now made over 45,000 images freely 
downloadable from its Collections Online digital database, 
giving the public access to the highest-resolution images it can 
and opening the way for creative reuse. 

Some of these images are no known copyright but many 
have been licensed under Creative Commons Attribution- 
NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (CC BY-NC-ND) licences. 
Releasing images of the collection for download is now a core 
part of the workflow of copyright assessment for Victoria. "It's 
no longer a one-off project. It's now a business-as-usual activity 
and providing the highest-resolution image file we can means 
much wider scope for potential reuse." 



Victoria's philosophy throughout has been one of 
incremental change: "let's iterate!" She says "GLAM 
professionals tend to be completionists, even perfectionists, 
and this isn't a project you're ever going to be able to 'finish'. 
One of the big messages I'm always trying to get across is to 
start with what you can do now, at the foot of the mountain. 
Don't worry about what's at the top. It might get solved as you 
go and, if it doesn't, you can better concentrate on solving it 
when you get there." 

The project's launch in June 2014 generated a lot of positive 
feedback for Te Papa, both nationally and internationally. There 
was a significant visitation spike to the Collections Online site. 
Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Chris Finlayson has 
recognised Te Papa's efforts and said: "These images from the 
national collection are a fantastic resource for New Zealanders. 
The Government's Open Access Licensing Framework cuts red 
tape, allowing the public to share and enjoy these thousands of 
images freely, as well as making them more readily available 
for use by professionals in the education, historical, cultural 
and creative sectors." 

"Another benefit of this work is the internal efficiency 
savings." Victoria noted that Collections Online is used heavily 
by Te Papa's own staff, and the new, clearer copyright and open 
licensing statements mean less confusion, less worry about 
inadvertently doing something illegal, and significantly less 
time taken up processing rights requests and queries. "Staff 
can cut straight through the necessary copyright bureaucracy 




and just do it themselves if they need an image for a sign, say, 
or an e-newsletter." 

But of course the main benefit is the creative and 
collaborative potential that freely available public domain or 
out-of-copyright and CC-licensed works bestow. One example 
close to home is the creation of a new artwork for the Nga Toi 
Arts Te Papa exhibition: Knowledge on a beam of starlight, a vinyl 
work by Kerry Ann Lee using found images. With Te Papa's 
permission Lee used images downloaded from Collections 
Online in her artwork. 

So what's next for Creative Commons at Te Papa? "Now 
we need to analyse the results so far, so that we can keep 
improving." Victoria wants to learn how people are using the 
images, and what effect the freely downloadable content is 
having on Te Papa's image licensing business. She is also very 
focused on spreading the word, and making sure that Kiwis 
know that their cultural treasures are emerging into the free 
digital domain. "Creative Commons is still really early days in 
New Zealand. We want people to know what's available and 
how they can use these incredible treasures." 




The National Library’s use 
and Reuse Policy 

On 20 May 2014 the National Library of New Zealand Te Puna 
Matauranga o Aotearoa published its use and reuse policy. In 
nine overarching principles, the policy aims to provide clarity 
and consistency around the use and reuse of the National 
Library's collections. 

In line with international 'open GLAM' (galleries, libraries, 
archives and museums) recommendations, principle four 
advises that "negotiations with rights owners and donors will 
promote and be informed by the Creative Commons licensing 
framework as a mechanism to facilitate use and reuse of in- 
copyright works". 

Principle five states: "Where no copyright restriction 
applies, the National Library will seek to provide the items 
for use and reuse with a statement of 'no known copyright 
restrictions', after careful consideration of cultural and ethical 
issues relating to the items." 

Other principles address the use of appropriate resolution 
size, the Government's Open Access and Licensing framework, 
and the treatment of 'orphan' works. 

Mark Crookston, Digital Collection Strategy Leader at the 
Alexander Turnbull Library at the National Library, first 
drafted the policy in early 2013. 

As he points out, "The purpose of the policy is to be able to 
have a consistent framework across the National Library for all 
of our reuse activities, from supply to management to delivery. 



"On the supply side - such as our negotiations and 
agreements with publishers and donors - the policy attempts 
to clarify what we say about reuse, and the metadata we use, as 
early in the process as possible. On the delivery side, the policy 
covers clear and consistent statements, resolution, and also 
trying to get the National Library to have more items available 
under 'no known copyright' restrictions." 

Mark notes that the initial conversations between the 
institution and the donor are critical, as this is where conditions 
around the reuse of collections' items are formed. These 
conditions "flow through the entire life of the collection while 
it's with us, which is in perpetuity," he says. 

This is why principle four advises that "negotiations with 
rights owners and donors will promote and be informed by 
the Creative Commons licensing framework". As part of the 
implementation of the principle, the National Library is likely 
to add a Creative Commons tick-box on the donor form, and 
provide donors with a range of explanatory resources. Donors 
will retain the right to restrict access to their work, if they so 
choose. 

The passage of the use and reuse policy took around 18 
months. "It was a series of conversations. It was important 
that we took our time and listened. The different perspectives 
in society around use and reuse - which can be a relatively 
contentious issue - also exist in the National Library itself. As 
an institution, we just talked our way through these issues. 

"As a collecting institution, we managed to get a general 
agreement as to the purpose of what we do: we develop 



collections, and make them accessible (including through 
digitisation), because we want people to use them. It was 
important to clarify that the accessibility and use concepts 
were different. That was a critical point for moving forward 
with the policy work." 

Now that the policy has been adopted, the National Library 
is working to implement its principles. 

"We're now establishing our process for the 'no known 
copyright' test, supporting principle five in the policy. We 
have a process to identify which collections go through the 
test, which includes considering any cultural or ethical reasons 
to restrict reuse - but still provide access. 

"A lot of great people in the National Library have worked 
hard to determine those cultural and ethical criteria. Some of 
this work is challenging those criteria, but it's also reaffirming 
some of them. We haven't yet determined all of the reasons to 
restrict reuse on a cultural basis, though the idea with the 'no 
known copyright test' is that we'll be able to determine some 
of those criteria as we go. 

"We're also developing procedures to follow when some 
works are reused in a way that goes against the restrictions 
set by the National Library or by donors. This goes to that 
amorphous issue of trust." 

The National Library is also undertaking to map the 
array of restrictions placed on works by its donors over the 
years, to ensure that online users are always made aware of 
these restrictions, while at the same time aiming for clear and 




consistent rights statements across the National Library's 
collections. 

As Mark says, “It sounds simple but there are a lot of 
current, past, and future permissions and rights statements we 
have to be able to reflect, cutting across sizeable and diverse 
collections, in different systems with differing technological 
capability." 

The National Library policy follows the release of around 
45,000 high-resolution images by the Museum of New Zealand 
Te Papa Tongarewa, under either a Creative Commons licence 
or a no known copyright statement. 

Mark believes that other collecting institutions are likely 
to follow in the footsteps of Te Papa and the National Library 
- and other international institutions like the Rijksmuseum - 
and is curious to see which approach other institutions take. 

"While Te Papa and the National Library share the same 
objectives - i.e. getting no known copyright images in high 
resolution available online - our approaches have differed 
slightly. Te Papa's approach is more to release large numbers 
of images in order to demonstrate value, which is great, they've 
done a magnificent job. On the other hand, the National 
Library took more of a policy approach to get our thinking 
and framework in place before implementing. I think both 
are relevant. It will be interesting to see how these approaches 
play out and what other institutions do. I think both Te Papa 
and the National Library have demonstrated useful paths 
forward." 




Opening New Zealand’s World war One 
Photography 

New Zealand officially commemorated the centenary of 
the outbreak of World War One with both a 100-gun salute 
and a field of 100 white crosses on the Parliamentary lawn. 
In addition to this, much of the New Zealand GLAM sector 
- that's Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums - has 
marked the centenary, both for its own sake, but also to 
draw attention to the depth and quality of our local heritage 
collections. The hub for these efforts is the WW100 website, 
which provides a range of resources, including a new search 
filter for World War One materials. 

Part of the promise of the centenary is to help remind 
New Zealanders that this is their history: regardless of 
whether one had family members in the war - or even had 
family members in New Zealand - the war shaped the kind of 
place that Aotearoa became. 

And if the events are p art of New Zealand' s common heritage, 
then so too are many of the works from that era. Recognising 
this, some of the largest organisations in the local GLAM sector 
have been working to ensure that the most significant heritage 
items from the war are made openly available to everyone, free 
of all technical, price and legal restrictions. 

A particularly interesting example of this is the work 
of the Alexander Turnbull Library (ATL) - in tandem with 
organisations across the culture and heritage sector - to release 
the H series of World War One photographs. 



The H series are photographs taken by Henry Armytage 
Sanders, and they are, as Melanie Lovell-Smith points out, 
"the most comprehensive visual record of New Zealanders on 
the Western front from 1917 to 1918". As Lovell-Smith says, 
before 1917 New Zealand didn't have an official photographer 
- due to the expense - which means that the only photographs 
before that date were those taken by the New Zealand troops 
themselves. 

The ATL has released digital reproductions of these 
photographs in high resolution, with clear 'no known copyright' 
statements. This means that anyone, anywhere, can view, share, 
download and reuse the official record of New Zealand in 
World War One, without asking permission or paying a fee. 

This follows the passage of the National Library of 
New Zealand Te Puna Matauranga o Aotearoa's Use and 
Reuse policy, principle five of which asserts that "Where no 
copyright restriction applies, the National Library will seek to 
provide tire items for use and reuse with a statement of 'no 
known copyright restrictions', after careful consideration of 
cultural and ethical issues relating to the items." 

While the release of the H Series is very exciting, it is just 
the latest in a run of Open GLAM developments. Beyond the 
publication of the National Library's open policy, Te Papa has 
also released over 45,000 open images under high resolution. 
Some of these are made available under a Creative Commons 
Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (CC BY-NC-ND) 
licence; others have been released without any copyright 
restrictions whatsoever. 




These content releases and open policies will surely be the 
first of many. There are hundreds of heritage institutions in 
New Zealand, with many millions of high-quality works. As 
these works are digitised - as they have been for the last 15 or 
so years - it's important that they are released as free of price, 
technical and legal restrictions as possible, so that as many 
Kiwis (and overseas visitors) as possible can access and engage 
with works from their own heritage. 

As was noted in some of the preliminary discussions 
behind the release of the H Series, New Zealand's culture 
and heritage sector does not have clear, standardised rights 
statements, and sometimes imposes additional price, legal or 
technical restrictions on the reuse of heritage works. Thomasin 
Sleigh, Community Manager of DigitalNZ A-tihi o Aotearoa 
and the Kiwi representative on the Open GLAM Working 
Group, tells us that heritage institutions will need to adopt 
clear policies and processes to be "clear, consistent, and open 
with our cultural collections". 




Canterbury Earthquake Digital 
Archive 

UC CEISMIC is a federated archive of materials from the 
Canterbury earthquakes, hosted by the University of Canterbury 
Te Whare Wananga o Waitaha, which launched in November 
2011. With content provided by major New Zealand cultural 
institutions, such as the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa 
Tongarewa and the National Library of New Zealand Te Puna 
Matauranga o Aotearoa, as well as ordinary New Zealanders, 
the archive is an extraordinary - and extraordinarily open - 
digital resource. 

The idea for the archive began when Associate Professor 
Paul Millar from the Department of English at the University 
of Canterbury approached Dr James Smithies, then working at 
the Ministry of Health Manatu Hauora, about what he could 
do in response to the February 2011 earthquakes. 

James pointed Paul to the 9/11 archive, organised by the 
Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. 
They also considered the Hurricane Memory Bank, a project 
designed to collect and preserve stories from hurricanes Rita 
and Katrina. Paul pitched the idea to the university's senior 
management team and received a very positive response. 
He immediately began tireless work to get James down to 
Christchurch and turn the idea into reality. 

With these projects in mind, James and Paul considered 
how they might build something similar for the Canterbury 




earthquakes. As James put it, the team soon decided that they 
"would just go out and collect everything." 

Dr Christopher Thomson, Programme Office Manager for 
UC CEISMIC, outlined the steps James and Paul had to take to get 
the archive online. 

"They put a proposal to the university and got some 
funding to set something up. From there, they started to have 
conversations with people across the cultural heritage sector, 
and saw that lots of people were asking the same kinds of 
questions about an archive for the Canterbury earthquakes. 
They then decided to set up the UC CEISMIC consortium." 

The UC CEISMIC consortium is led by the University of 
Canterbury and made up of organisations from across the 
cultural heritage sector, including Archives New Zealand 
Te Rua Mahara o te Kawanatanga, the National Library of 
New Zealand, the Ministry for Culture and Heritage (MCH) 
Manatu Taonga, the Canterbury Museum, Christchurch City 
Libraries Nga Kete Wananga o Otautahi, NZ On Screen, the 
Ngai Tahu Research Centre, the Canterbury Earthquake 
Recovery Authority Te Mana Haumanu ki Waitaha, the 
Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, and Nga Taonga 
Sound and Vision. 

Christopher says, "The idea was that each of the consortium 
members would collect their own material and archive it 
according to their own policies, and then use DigitalNZ to 
surface it in one place, so that users could search for earthquake- 
related content at ceismic.org.nz." 




So where does Creative Commons come in? Given the 
ambitions of the project, in these early stages "Creative Commons 
wasn't in the mix". Later, though, James began to introduce the 
idea of open licensing. 

James had been a Creative Commons supporter for years, 
had strong support from Paul to investigate Creative Commons 
licences, and was offered excellent advice from Jason Darwin 
at CWA New Media (later Learning Media Limited). He 
understood the problems 'all rights reserved' copyright can 
pose for heritage projects and soon found there were issues 
having multiple licensing agreements across different sections 
of the project. 

The problem was handed to Christopher Thomson when 
he arrived in the team. However, little progress could be made, 
despite his best efforts and those of a range of stakeholders. 
The problem was most difficult with research-oriented data, 
which had specific issues related to ethics and privacy. 

In the end, when approaching potential depositors, the UC 
CEISMIC team recommended the use of Creative Commons 
licences, though remained open to more restrictive licensing 
agreements, according to the specific needs of content 
providers. 

The archive launched in November 2011, with 10,000 items, 
and continues to grow. 

The University of Canterbury's specific contribution to the 
consortium is called UC QuakeStudies, and includes materials 
from Fairfax Media, Environment Canterbury Kaunihera 




Taiao ki Waitaha and Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga. 
While much of this content remains 'all rights reserved', the 
archive has added a collection by Murray Quartly, who runs 
focus360.co.nz. 

After the earthquakes, Murray took a series of 360-degree 
panorama photographs of central Christchurch, producing 
what Christopher describes as a "virtual tour of the Red Zone". 
After meeting with the UC CEISMIC team, Murray decided 
to release the photos under a Creative Commons Attribution- 
NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (CC BY-NC-ND) licence. 

Another significant part of the consortium is QuakeStories, 
which is run by MCH. This archive contains stories and 
photos of the earthquake from ordinary New Zealanders, 
and is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution- 
NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) licence. 

Both Christopher and James suggest that the biggest 
hurdles to using Creative Commons licences have come from 
researchers - especially those working through the University's 
ethics committee, which is already a complex process. 

The UC CEISMIC team continues to encourage their 
partners to use open licensing wherever possible, and Creative 
Commons licences remain a core part of the UC CEISMIC 
programme. 

Christopher says, "We don't really know how people 
are going to use our content. It makes sense to make it open 
wherever possible, because we don't know what research 
questions and methods will be like in 100 years' time. We want 
to leave that open as far as possible, for the future." 



NZ On Screen and Audio Culture 



NZ On Screen has provided online access to a wealth of 
New Zealand film, television and music videos since 2008. 
From the outset it has used a Creative Commons Attribution- 
NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) licence for all the work on the 
site where the copyright is owned by NZ On Screen. While the 
video content often belongs to third-party rights-holders, all 
the synopses, backgrounds and biographies relating to videos 
and people are licensed under CC. This material is impressive 
in its scope and quality; the introductions to tire collections, 
particularly, are personable as well as thorough. 

Clarion Coughlan, former Project Director, says their aim 
is not to put everything they possibly can online, but rather to 
choose culturally significant pieces and give them space to talk 
to each other. 

NZ On Screen is a curated website, carefully chosen and 
added to, and the context provided by the written material is 
crucial. Clarion says, "rather than just publishing videos, we 
contextualise them through our writing. As NZ On Screen has 
been paid for by taxpayers (via NZ On Air funding), it makes 
sense to make that writing available under Creative Commons: 
to give something back." 

Having that CC-licensed work reused also serves as a useful 
advertising tool; when writers reuse their pieces on blogs or 
have them published elsewhere, and actors' agencies reuse what 
is effectively a pre-written biography, the Creative Commons 
licence brings people back to the NZ On Screen website. 



Perhaps due to the popularity of NZ On Screen, May 2013 
saw the launch of a sister project, AudioCulture - the 'noisy 
library of New Zealand music'. The site aims to address the 
'digital silence' that has surrounded New Zealand music 
online, and to collect together tire stories, multimedia and 
ephemera that have contributed to New Zealand music from 
the last 100 years. 

AudioCulture kicked off with 250 pages of people, 
labels and scenes, all under searchable indexes, plus music, 
interviews and photographs, with another 300 pages following 
in the second year. It was very well-received, gaining 25,000 
page views in its first month live, and continues to grow. 

Following the successful formula employed over at NZ 
On Screen, the music on the site is licensed by PPNZ Music 
Licensing and APRA/AMCOS and the images have been 
cleared with copyright owners, but the written content in 
Profiles, Stories, Labels and Scenes all falls under the Creative 
Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) licence. 
Like the written content on NZ On Screen, these pieces are 
not brief introductions; they are well-researched and in-depth, 
written by a wide variety of contributors, often with a personal 
connection to the subject, providing an extraordinary depth of 
context. 




Ministry for Culture and Heritage 



The Ministry for Culture and Heritage Manatu Taonga (MCH) 
is dedicated to supporting New Zealand's arts, media, heritage 
and sports organisations, including Creative New Zealand, the 
New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, RadioNZ and many more. 

MCH also produces a range of public resources, including 
Te Ara The Encyclopedia of New Zealand and New Zealand 
History Online Nga Korero a Ipurangi o Aotearoa. Since 2011, 
the text for both of these sites has been licensed under a Creative 
Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC) Licence. 

Matthew Oliver, Manager of the Web Team at MCH, says, 
“We recognised that the taxpayer has paid for this content to 
be developed, and were aware of plans around NZGOAL, and 
we saw our content as part of that." 

NZGOAL is the New Zealand Government Open Access 
and Licensing framework, which encourages public sector 
agencies to use Creative Commons licences, to enable the 
public to share, remix and reuse publicly funded content. 

The team was happy to fulfil the principles of NZGOAL, as 
they had already recognised the importance of disseminating 
their content. “The more we could get our content used, the 
more we justify our work. By making our content available 
for reuse, we show that our content is important, that there 
is a need. 

“The sticking point came down to what sort of licence we'd 
adopt, which is why we ended up using the Noncommercial 
licence. We had to consider authors' rights, publishing and 



licensing deals. We were also sensitive to authors, who often 
work for very little or for free." 

Matthew believes that Creative Commons licensing could 
help to reduce some of the duplication that occurs in the 
cultural sector. "If one organisation is good at storing images, 
and another is good at writing stories about images, let's 
combine them, rather than repeating each other's work. 

"It's great that the cultural sector is starting to share each 
other's work, but we should also be sharing it with the public. 
This ties into the Government's commitment to supporting 
innovation. There are some great New Zealand companies 
who would love some good content. We've got content. It's 
there. With Creative Commons licensing, they can use it." 

Without Creative Commons licensing, some innovative 
and important projects may suffer in quality, or never get off 
the ground. "You just don't know what people will do with 
this content, if they could get hold of it. If you make the content 
available, someone with more time and more expertise is going 
to do something that a government organisation can't do." 

Researchers also benefit from open licensing, as it simplifies 
the process of clearing picture rights. "We also don't know how 
much time this is adding to their research, and what they're 
deciding not to use." 

Matthew hopes that culture and heritage institutions will 
continue to open up their collections. "I'm inclined to start 
from a default position of everything should be open, and let's 
see where the problems come up. There'll always be problems 




- privacy, donor agreements, WAI262 - but the vast majority of 
content isn't affected. Start from the other direction. 

“If you lock your content away, nobody knows about it. 
Forget advertising. You don't need an advertising budget if you 
let your content go out there and speak for you. If your image 
goes out there, and it's got a link back to your website - and 
if somebody finds that content useful and spreads the word 
about it - you're getting free advertising. You're letting the 
asset that you've got go and promote you as an organisation." 




Open 

Research 




Open Access to Research in 
Aotearoa 

By Fabiana Kubke, Senior Lecturer at School of Medical Sciences, 
University of Auckland Te Whare Wananga o Tamaki Makarua, 
and Matt McGregor, Public Lead, Creative Commons Aotearoa 
New Zealand 

Access Denied 

Stop me if you've heard this one before. You're researching 
an issue that you care about and find a link to an important 
study, a study that promises to give you greater insight about 
the subject at hand. 

Let's say you're interested in geology, and the article is in 
the New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics, published 
(with public funding) by the Royal Society of New Zealand Te 
Aparangi. It also happens to be co-authored by a researcher 
from one of New Zealand's publicly funded research 
institutions. 

You click on the link and find yourself faced with this 
message: "Sorry, you don't have access to this article." You are 
asked if you want to purchase the article - for a grand total of 
USD$48 (or AUD$146 for the whole issue). 

That, for most people, is the end of the process. It doesn't 
matter whether you are a businessperson, a policy-maker, a 
journalist, a curious member of the public, a student or an 
independent researcher - you'll need to pay to get access. And 
if you can't pay? Well, tough. 



An Untenable Situation 

If you work or study in a university or research institute, you 
might not know that this is a problem - or maybe you don't 
think it's a problem for you. 

But before you make up your mind, consider this: the 
research sector pays over $50 million on subscriptions to 
academic journals. That's about the same amount allocated to 
support research by the Marsden Fund. 

More to the point, that $50 million doesn't pay for all 
published research. University libraries, faced with flatlining 
budgets, are having to decrease the number of journals they 
can provide access to. 

And if you aren't yet convinced that this is a serious 
problem, consider this memo from the Faculty Advisory Panel 
of Flarvard University, which stated that the cost of journal 
subscriptions was "an untenable situation" and that steadily 
increasing subscription charges had "made the scholarly 
communication environment fiscally unsustainable and 
academically restrictive". 1 

How could something as fundamental to the life of 
a university as journal subscriptions - that is, access to 
knowledge - become "fiscally unsustainable" to tire richest 
university on the planet? 

As it turns out, this issue has been bubbling away for some 
time. In 2004 the Association of Research Libraries in the US 
revealed that the average cost of a journal subscription had 
risen 315% from 1989 to 2003 for its member libraries - that's 



i http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k77982&amp;tabgroupid=icb.tabgroupi43448 




compared to a rate of inflation of only 68%. Since then journal 
prices have continued to rise by 9% per year. 2 

The Public Interest 

Academics, then, don't often have immediate access to the 
research they need, and it continues to cost more and more 
just to maintain the access they currently have. But for those 
who work outside the research sector, the current system is 
even worse. 

Journalists, for example, are often unable to go beyond 
press releases when covering science. As Peter Griffin, 
Manager of the New Zealand Science Media Centre, says, 
“Newsrooms today don't have the resources to subscribe 
to academic databases that would be useful in the process 
of generating news content. For journalists, this can be 
extremely frustrating." 

Similarly, non-government organisations (NGOs) and 
policy-makers often lack access to the latest academic research, 
as do the individuals and groups that contribute to the policy- 
making process. 

Lillian Grace, Chief Executive of Figure. NZ, notes that open 
access to research will enable Aotearoa to get more from its 
publicly funded research. She says, “The value realised from 
publicly funded research will be hugely increased by making 
it open for others throughout our country to learn and apply 
findings to business, social, economic and environmental 
endeavours."

Siouxsie Wiles, Senior Lecturer at the University of 
Auckland Te Whare Wananga o Tamaki Makarua and recipient 
of the Prime Minister's Award for Science Communication, 
notes the broader public importance of Open Access. "Science 
can empower people to make informed choices that shape their 
future for the better. This is the message I want to communicate 
and why I believe unrestricted access to the science we fund is 
in everyone's best interest." 

The Growth of Open Access 

The basic definition of Open Access is simple. As Harvard 
University Librarian Peter Suber puts it, "Open Access 
literature is digital, online, free of charge and free of most 
copyright and licensing restrictions." The basic principle of 
Open Access is also simple: namely, that everyone should be 
able to freely access and reuse the research outputs that are 
the result of public funding. This includes everything from 
books and journal articles to research data. 

There are two basic models for enabling access: either the 
publisher makes the research article available, sometimes for a 
fee (the 'gold' model); or the researcher deposits an accepted 
version of the article in an institutional or discipline-specific 
repository (the 'green' model). There are currently over 700 
funders and institutions across the world with Open Access 
policies. 

Four New Zealand universities (Lincoln, Waikato, 
Canterbury and Auckland) have policies in support of 'green' 




deposit, with Lincoln University's policy also including 
teaching resources and encouraging the use of Creative 
Commons licences. 

One of the world's leading research institutions, MIT, has 
had an open research policy since 2009 following a unanimous 
faculty vote, and they've been collecting stories from the 
members of the public who have benefitted. Their stories are a 
powerful reminder of why Open Access is essential. 

A private researcher from Australia, for example, writes, 
"[I am] a disabled engineer researching gravity and inertia... 
My research is hampered by one thing alone, paywalls." 

A student in India points to the barriers that exist in 
developing nations: “It's really disheartening when a site 
asks for money to display their research work. This initiative 
will . . . accelerate research in the emerging nations." 

A researcher from the US notes the importance of Open 
Access to economic development: "I'm attempting to hire and 
fund research in energy production. I have a lot of trouble 
getting to the bottom of scientific understanding due to the 
publishing industry paywalls. MIT's effort to make good 
science that the public helped pay for be available to the public 
has helped me a lot building the clean energy economy." 

Make It Open? No, Make It Libre! 

My institution - the University of Auckland Te Whare W ananga 
o Tamaki Makaurau - like other academic institutions around 
the country, has an Institutional Repository (IR). It is called 




'Research Space' and I suspect many of my colleagues might 
have never heard of it, and many might not know how to make 
use of it. 

As we've pointed out above, Open Access is usually des- 
cribed as gold or green. I don't personally find this distinction 
palatable, because the gold/green definition says more about 
mechanisms of delivery and less about liberties for reuse. 

I prefer to think about free Open Access (where the article 
is provided free of charge) and libre Open Access (where the 
article is provided free of charge and there are few restrictions 
for reuse and repurposing). The copyright agreements we enter 
or the licence we choose when publishing Open Access defines 
where in the free-libre spectrum the article will sit. 

If we wish to communicate our findings as widely as 
possible, shouldn't we be opting for libre Open Access, where 
they can be reused, redistributed and repurposed? 

“Limiting Potential Readership Does Not Increase Actual 
Readership" 

Unfortunately, research publications do not solely serve 
the purpose of communicating our findings. They are also 
perhaps the most important contribution through which our 
worth as academics will be measured when we apply for a job, 
apply for promotion, or seek to be granted tenure. We may be 
forgiven many things by staffing committees, but never a poor 
publication record. We have been taught that how we brand 




our publications (i.e. where we publish them) will be a major 
factor for that assessment. 

It is not surprising, then, that most of us will feel the need to 
do our best to place our article in the better branded journals. 
Many of these will charge hefty Open Access fees, but will 
publish our article sometimes at a lower price or free of charge 
if we are willing to give our rights as authors away to them. 
Because this decision of where to publish is so intricately tied to 
career progress, the cultural inertia is hard to overcome. 

These days, it is rare that I will find someone who doesn't 
think that Open Access is 'a good thing' (progress!). As soon as 
the term 'Open Access' enters the discussion, however, I can 
see the $-shaped tears rolling down someone's cheeks. Most 
frequently the discussion veers towards a standard list of 'buts' . 

Many of these 'buts' are myths that seem to persist even 
in the face of evidence against them. Once someone has the 
mindset that Open Access is not a 'viable' alternative to be 
embraced by them, by their immediate community of practice 
or even by their institution, it does not seem to matter how 
much data is presented - the response will inevitably be "Oh, 
ok. [pause] But..." If we cannot change scientists' minds 
when confronting them with evidence, how will we be able to 
persuade our agencies and institutions? Until we overcome our 
apprehensions about Open Access, should we just stick to the 
status quo? 

Institutional Repositories (IRs) provide a place where 
authors who choose to publish in the traditional way can 




deposit their peer-reviewed, accepted article for anyone to 
access free of charge - and thus massively increase their 
potential readership. All the authors need to do is to contact 
their librarian and they will happily show them how to do this. 
In New Zealand, articles that are deposited in these IRs are 
given a second life, free of paywalls and indexed by Google. 
In New Zealand the articles (and other research artifacts) are 
aggregated in http://nzresearch.org.nz/. 

I can't help wondering whether, if we were asked to 
identify at our annual performance review (or continuation, 
or promotions) the proportion of our output that was 
deposited in IRs, we might see some progress. 

My personal position is that research outputs that result 
from public funds should be made available under a copyright 
licence that minimises the restrictions on distribution and 
reuse. I also understand that authors may base their choice 
of where they publish on different kinds of reasons (some of 
which I understand and others of which I don't). But even 
when authors choose to publish under traditional pay-walled 
schemes, the value of depositing in the IR far outweighs the 
reasons not to do so. 

As Bjorn Brembs put it, "No matter what field (or planet): 
limiting potential readership does not increase actual 
readership ." 3

ePreSS: Open Access Publishing 
at Unitec 

ePress is an Open Access scholarly publishing house at Unitec 
Institute of Technology Te Whare Wananga o Wairaka. It 
works from the philosophy that the global political economy 
is one of the key barriers to human social process. Information 
should be free and not a market commodity with a profit 
attached to it. 

Evangelia Papoutsaki, Editor-in-Chief, says, "At ePress we 
believe that knowledge should be accessible to all. Academics 
are paid by taxpayers to research and produce knowledge, and 
the idea that students and the general public must pay for that 
knowledge does not sit well with us. It should be available to 
anyone who has the desire to read and use it. Citizens have the 
right to learn; access to information and knowledge should not 
be through their wallets." 

ePress is an online, quality-assured, in-house publisher 
for authors and researchers working at, or associated with, 
Unitec. As well as there being research produced at Unitec that 
needed a publishing home, there were other outputs such as 
performances, mixed media, design and art installations that 
all had potential as non-traditional publications. 

The idea of ePress emerged out of a desire to harness 
the publishing potential of all these outputs by providing a 
platform from which they could be shared. Launched in late 
2011, ePress started off with the more traditional conference 
proceedings and reports, and quickly grew to embrace 



eMedia and books. In 2014 ePress really hit its stride with the 
publication of two books, Press, Politics and People in Papua 
New Guinea 1950-1975 by Philip Cass and Nga Reanga Youth 
Development Maori Styles by Josie Keelan; an edited collection, 
Communication Issues in Aotearoa New Zealand edited by Giles 
Dodson and Evangelia Papoutsaki; two wonderful eMedia, 
Rosebank: Cabbages, Horses and Science by Paul Woodruffe and 
The Moveable Feast Collective Teach Design by Susan Jowsey, as 
well as publishing conference proceedings for the 31st Annual 
Society of Architectural Historians Australia and New Zealand 
(translation edited by Christoph Schnoor). 

At the beginning of 2015, ePress unveiled new layouts 
and cover art for their regular series, launched a new series 
titled Perspectives in Biosecurity Research Series edited by Dan 
Blanchon and Mel Galbraith, and announced the production 
of a forthcoming collection titled Conceptual Works in Sports 
Studies, edited by Lesley Ferkins and Mieke Sieuw. 

The academic perception of Open Access scholarly 
publishing has definitely changed over time. It used to be very 
much one of scholarly snobbery. If your work wasn't in the right 
journal, or published to certain standards, it was of no merit to 
academia. However, things are changing, and fast. The methods 
for producing knowledge are changing and so too should our 
method of dissemination. More and more scholars are accepting 
and embracing the idea that there are other ways to prepare, 
produce and disseminate information. ePress has a strong 
focus on eMedia publications and they are a great example of 
alternative ways to share that knowledge. With these methods 




have come new researchers, authors and producers who believe 
that Open Access is the way forward for them. This new way of 
thinking is producing some truly fun and unique publications 
that might not have found a home anywhere else. More 
traditional publishers would not have been able to control 
their distribution and make a profit. 

When authors submit to ePress their processes are 
explained along with the Creative Commons licensing system. 

"We automatically assign new publications with the 
Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY- 
NC) licence and give authors time to investigate the other 
licences, should they wish to change," says Evangelia. "The 
response to the licensing, and the one we auto-select for them, 
has been well received by all of our authors. For those who 
are new to Creative Commons, they have really embraced the 
goals of Open Access publishing - though they are publishing 
with ePress so to an extent they are probably Open Access 
supporters already!" 




Anatomy Teaching Model Patterns 
Licensed with GG 

Using her background in fashion and design, Fieke Neuman, 
Teaching Laboratory Manager, Department of Anatomy 
Te Tari Kikokiko, University of Otago Te Whare Wananga 
o Otago, has created anatomy teaching models of various 
human body parts using fabric, metals and other materials. 
She has released the patterns for these models under a 
Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-Share Alike 
(CC BY-NC-SA) licence. 

It started at the December 2012 combined Australasian 
Institute of Anatomical Sciences/ Australian &amp; New Zealand 
Association of Clinical Anatomists (AIAS/ANZACA) 
conference in Coogee, where Fieke gave a talk about some 
fabric models she had made for teaching anatomy. She 
promised to send the patterns to people she'd talked to at the 
conference, once she'd sorted out copyright issues. 

She had known of the University of Otago's policy regarding 
intellectual property for decades, without considering that it 
would ever apply to her. The policy meant that Fieke couldn't 
copyright her work without the permission of the university. 

She raised the issue with her colleagues in the Department 
of Anatomy. They briefly discussed the possibility of selling 
the patterns but decided that they would get more benefit, as 
a department, by sharing them. They recognised that it would 
require quite a bit of time, money and effort to set up a system 
to sell such items - more than it would be worth. Fieke has run 




a fashion business in the past and knew how difficult it would 
be to make sales to cover all of the costs involved. They also 
saw the benefit of strengthening bonds with their community 
by being generous and not hiding away information that 
others could use. Sharing meant using Creative Commons but 
it also meant getting formal permission from the University 
to give away the standard copyright. So, in 2013, Fieke got 
permission from her Head of Department and he wrote to the 
Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Health Sciences who also gave formal 
permission. 

They chose the CC BY-NC-SA licence as it allows others to 
remix, tweak, and build upon their work non-commercially, as 
long as they credit the originator and license their new creations 
under identical terms. It suits the spirit of the scientific and 
teaching community of which they are a part. 




Canterbury’s Mandatory 
Research Deposit 

By Anton Angelo, Research Data Coordinator, University of 
Canterbury Te Whare Wananga o Waitaha 

In 2014 I had an email discussion with the developer for our 
university research information system. My request was to 
make a file upload field required rather than optional. It, 
in the scheme of things, is a tiny change - a couple of lines 
of code in an application that is going to be used by a few 
hundred people at a medium scale university. 

In this case though, the change that this represents is 
huge. It is the bleeding edge of a change in the way that we 
understand intellectual property, and realigns the academy 
with its original intention of being a university. 

Canterbury, like well over 200 other universities, is 
adopting an 'institutional mandate' for depositing research 
into its Institutional Repository (IR). We have purposefully 
kept the word 'mandate', as the implication of imposing 
something on scholars provoked the discussion we wanted - 
positive engagement with what we were proposing. In reality 
the policy suggests that, in the absence of a good reason, every 
time a scholar publishes something it should be made freely 
available, and we provide a mechanism to do that with our IR. 
If a scholar wishes to opt out, they should feel free, but we're 
curious to know why. 

The small technical change we are making is that we're 
requiring a copy of a research output submitted for the 



Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) process to be 
made available and openly accessible for the entire world, by 
uploading it to our IR. Currently, University of Canterbury 
scholars can volunteer to upload articles, and about 8% of our 
research output is put on the web and openly accessible. By 
making the file upload field required, we hope to see a tenfold 
increase in deposits. 

As usual, there are historical precedents. The Library of 
Alexandria had a mandate to take all the books arriving in 
the port, copy them, keep the originals and return the copies. 
This way - along with an excellent and aggressive collections 
budget - the biggest library in the world was created. 

Reaction to the suggestion of the policy in the community 
was interesting. The vast majority of faculty research 
committee meetings and private conversations ended with, 
"Why are we not doing this already?" It underscored the 
importance most researchers seem to place on having 
the widest possible audience for their work. There were 
exceptions, usually based on the culture of a particular 
academic discipline. For example: high-energy physicists 
(and others) already use a repository, ArXive. Why should 
they bother with another one? 

I admit that uploading things to tire IR is a faff for a lot of 
reasons. For example, because of the copyright most publishers 
take when they agree to print an article, scholars have to upload 
a version that is not the final published one. Academics are not 
always great administrators, and can lose their manuscripts. As 
well as that, it is an extra button to push, a file to hunt down on 



their hard drive, and then, finally, troubling thoughts of "Am I 
allowed to do this?" can overwhelm all but the most robustly 
legally minded. That last one - what are you allowed to do 
with your own work? - is a doozy. A scholar in the humanities 
admitted to me that on being offered the loan of a book his first 
thought was, "Is he allowed to loan me that?" So entrenched 
are our anxieties on copyright that even the thing that lets 
libraries exist can be questioned by people who should know 
much, much better. 

I make no apologies for the faff, for it is not faff of our 
making. We pay researchers to do research, and their 
research needs to be available for that most old-fashioned 
of reasons: the common good. You can quantify the good all 
you like in terms of innovation and product development 
and state corporate bottom line maximisation, but for me 
the qualitative argument comes first, and looms largest. It's 
the right thing to do. So why is it hard? Wherefore the faff? 
Traditional academic publishers are on a bit of a losing wicket 
on this one. Made gigantic on the economic imperatives of 
globalisation and the efficiencies of the library 'big deal', they 
now have profits they are legally bound to protect for their 
shareholders. Faff is their stock-in-trade as a way of slowing 
down the opposition - the IR. 

Here are a few ways academic publishers try to slow down 
deposit into IRs: 

• Most standard publisher-author agreements allow only 
an obscure version of the work to be added to the IR. 




• They confuse the Open Access (O A) landscape by offering 
their own version of openly accessible articles, and play 
divide and conquer with their customers by making the 
academic pay a charge (often in the thousands of dollars) 
to publish under an open licence. 

• Additionally, sometimes they offer their own 'open' 
licences, resulting in even greater uncertainty. 

• They employ third parties to scour IRs to find material 
that could be non-compliant, and send threatening 
letters. Libraries, being excellent corporate citizens, 
respond to these by removing material. 

• Knowing that old data is less sexy data, they require 
embargoes on the release of IR versions of articles, 
knowing that makes the IRs less useful. 

• As well as this, at least one publisher requires embargoes 
on IR content only if the institution requires its scholars 
to submit their research outputs to its IR, an open 
recognition that IRs threaten publishers' business 
models. 

It may seem with all those tactics that there is a great 
conflict going on, but there really isn't. It is not a war. The 
arbitrary exclusions and hoops above are the artefacts of a 
rapidly changing (and potentially failing) business model. 
New publishers, like PeerJ, Hindawi and PLoS among many, 
many others, are simply starting with the assumption that the 
material will be OA, and they are a low or non-profit business 
and can undercut the old guard entirely. 




At Canterbury we have made a tiny technical change. 
Instead of asking scholars to volunteer their work to be made 
openly accessible, we ask why they would not. That little thing 
signals a mighty change for the availability of new knowledge 
to the world. 




Lincoln University’s Open Access 
Policy 

In July 2013 Lincoln University Te Whare Wanaka o Aoraki 
passed a wide-ranging Open Access policy, becoming the first 
New Zealand university to do so. Coverage includes research 
outputs such as data, teaching materials and the university's 
business records. 

The policy states that “as an organisation Lincoln University 
has a policy position which endorses making content openly 
and freely available as the first and preferred option". It goes 
on to state, "Lincoln University takes a broad ethical position 
which asserts that if public funding has supported the creation 
of an idea, research or other content then it is reasonable and 
fair that it be made publicly accessible." 

The policy also encourages copyright owners "to apply 
a Creative Commons Licence to their intellectual output to 
determine how material may be used, reused or repurposed". 

Penny Carnaby, the University Librarian at Lincoln, had 
been aware of the benefits of Open Access and open licensing 
since her time as National Librarian at the National Library 
of New Zealand Te Puna Matauranga o Aotearoa, where 
she participated in the Chief Executives' steering group on 
Open Data and information during the development of the 
New Zealand Government's Open Access and Licensing 
framework (NZGOAL). 

Approved by Cabinet in 2010, NZGOAL supports and 
advocates for the uptake of Creative Commons licensing 



for copyright works produced or funded by State Services 
agencies. 

From her experience at the National Library, Penny 
became particularly interested in opening up copyright 
works produced by the university sector, including journal 
articles, datasets and educational resources. She also noted 
the growing importance of Institutional Repositories (IRs) in 
research libraries around the world as a way of ensuring much 
greater public access to the intellectual output of an academic 
institution. Penny had been at the National Library when 
the network of IRs was established, along with the National 
Library-managed NZResearch, which uses a DigitalNZ- 
powered harvester to gather information from research 
deposited in repositories across the New Zealand research 
sector and make it easier to find. 

Noting the strength of Lincoln's Institutional Repository, 
LURA, Penny began to investigate what it would take to 
develop New Zealand's first Open Access policy at Lincoln, in 
line with other universities around the world. The policy was 
given strong support from the Vice Chancellor, Dr Andrew 
West, who nominated Open Access as a business driver for the 
university in 2013. 

This strong institutional support enabled a process 
of consultation across the university, which gave staff an 
opportunity to voice concerns before the policy was approved. 
The university also developed a joint union and management 
working party, which spent six months working through issues 




and developing a final policy that the university community 
could be comfortable with. 

Penny notes that research staff were, generally speaking, 
comfortable with the principle of open scholarship, as they 
could see the inherent benefits of Open Access to disseminating 
their research to a broader audience. 

The same was not true of open educational resources, which 
was a relatively novel concept to most teaching staff. "Academics 
are generally dual professionals," Penny says. "Each profession 
- teaching and research - has different drivers. Researchers 
are often fundamentally motivated by the desire to see their 
published works have a broad public impact. We found that 
the same is not necessarily true of academic teaching resources. 

"In the end, we developed an elegant and respectful solution: 
the copyright to educational resources would remain with the 
creator, while the university would retain the right to use these 
resources for the educational purposes of the institution - such 
as using them as open educational resources in Massive Open 
Online Courses (MOOCs)." 

Penny notes that this process of discussion and consultation 
was both the most important and most difficult part of 
implementing Open Access across the university. 

In order to support the implementation process, Lincoln 
held its Open Access Week in July 2013, holding several public 
events, including a talk by Dr Mark Hahnel, CEO of Figshare, 
and a debate on Open Access, with the moot 'Open Access or 
Open Slather?'. 




These events helped expose awareness gaps in the 
institution which a university-wide implementation group is 
helping to address. 

Penny advises other institutions developing an Open 
Access policy to "make the policy itself as broad as possible - 
including not only research articles but educational resources 
and even public records. Institutions will also need to develop 
the policies alongside other existing policy settings, such as 
data management and intellectual property." 

"And then think very carefully about implementation. 
Implementation is everything." At Lincoln, this process of 
implementing the policy has led to - at last count - 87 discrete 
activities across the university. 

"Open Access changes every conversation you have," says 
Penny. "Rather than arguing why works need to be open, the 
focus at Lincoln University is on why certain works need to 
be closed. This requires a massive cultural shift to take place." 




Open Access at the University 
of Waikato 

On 4 March 2014 the University of Waikato Te Whare Wananga 
o Waikato announced the passage of an Open Access mandate, 
becoming the first university to adopt a direct deposit mandate 
in New Zealand, and the second university, after Lincoln, to 
adopt an institutional Open Access policy. 

The primary principle driving the adoption of the policy, as 
stated in its opening line, is that: "Freedom to exchange ideas 
and to publish acquired knowledge are fundamental to the 
purposes of a university." 

The policy represents the University of Waikato's 
commitment "to the concept of Open Access to knowledge 
through the deposit of full text of academic publications into 
the University's digital repository, the Research Commons, 
wherever possible". 

The momentum for the policy was established during Open 
Access Week 2012, when Open Access advocates Fabiana Kubke 
and Alex Holcombe spoke at a panel entitled 'An Open Access 
Mandate for the University of Waikato?'. The panel generated 
interest in Open Access from the university community, and 
led to David Nichols, Senior Lecturer in Computer Science, 
and Ross Hallett, University Librarian, developing a detailed 
paper outlining the benefits, risks and options for an Open 
Access policy at the University of Waikato. 

In that paper, David and Ross gave the university many 
different ideas about how an Open Access policy might look. 



David says, "We deliberately provided the university with a 
range of options and wording for the policy. We also made 
sure that we explicitly laid out the costs and benefits." 

In presenting the policy to groups within the university, 
David emphasised the importance of the digital visibility of 
the institution and noted the successful deposit mandate in 
place for student theses since 2006. 

In terms of benefits, David and Ross pointed out the 
increased download rates and potential citation advantages. 
They also noted the broader importance of making the 
university's research available to society in general, including 
industry, university alumni and professional groups, such as 
teachers and journalists. 

David notes that higher ideals, such as the need for the 
public to have access to publicly funded research, were also 
emphasised during the consultation process. This ties in 
nicely with the motto of the university "Ko Te Tangata - For 
the People", which, in the context of OA, is expressed as the 
university's "commitment to disseminating the fruits of its 
research and scholarship as widely as possible". 

After releasing the paper, it travelled for several months, 
with David and Ross, through the various committees of the 
university, a process which enabled staff from every school 
and faculty to provide comments and raise potential concerns. 

One such concern was the question of what happens if 
infringing material is uploaded to tire Institutional Repository 
(IR). Some academics were concerned about possible liability 
should they mistakenly upload material for which they do not 



have the rights. They were reassured when told that library 
repository staff would continue to offer a mediated deposit 
service, checking publisher copyright agreements for potential 
infringement before adding items to the repository. 

The consultation process also provided the opportunity to 
clarify confusion around green and gold Open Access ('green' 
Open Access is self archiving journal articles in an Open Access 
repository; 'gold' is publishing in an Open Access journal), 
as well as the names publishers give to document versions 
at different stages of the review process, such as 'preprint', 
'postprint' and 'published'. 

David noted that it was also important for Waikato to 
include a waiver in their policy for those publications that may 
not be appropriate for deposit in the IR. "It was important that 
the policy wasn't seen as entirely black and white." 

Waikato's policy is green Open Access, with no references 
to gold (or publisher-implemented) Open Access or Creative 
Commons licensing. David points out, "We've restricted the 
definition of Open Access for this policy to 'read-only'. The 
policy doesn't engage with reuse rights at all. These are issues 
that we may be able to address in future revisions, though it 
was important that this policy took the simplest first step. 

"A general notion of incrementalism was essential to 
the whole process, especially given the fact that scholarly 
publishing is a changing landscape, with many moving parts, 
including requirements from external funders." 

This incremental approach followed those taken by 
comparable institutions overseas, such as Queensland 



University of Technology (QUT), which has had a deposit 
mandate since 2004. David and Ross consulted with QUT 
during the development of the policy. 

"QUT has also made public useful information about the 
progress of its policy over time, including graphs of the effects 
on deposit rates. Its model suggested that we needed to take 
a long-term approach to implementing the policy - there was 
never going to be an instant change. Progress will be gradual." 

This is one of the reasons Waikato didn't follow the example 
of another leading Open Access institution, the University 
of Liege, which mandates that only works deposited in the 
Institutional Repository will be considered during internal 
promotion and review. While this is a good model for 
increasing the number of works in the IR, it is potentially less 
helpful for gaining support from researchers. 

David is now working with the National Library, Research 
Office and Information Technology Services to implement a 
new research information system - called Symplectic Elements 
- to help reduce the transaction costs of depositing research into 
the university's repository. 

As David pointed out, while the policy is important, the 
means of technically implementing tire policy must be as 
smooth as possible. With the new system, the time commitment 
required by the academic to deposit an article should be no 
more than the time required to respond to an email request. 

The new system will also help Waikato determine the 
baseline number of Open Access articles currently published 




by university staff, which will make it easier to chart progress 
in the years to come. 

Ultimately, David underlines the importance of basing 
the Open Access efforts at the library. He also advises other 
institutions looking at Open Access to factor in a lot of 
consultation and listening to staff. As different disciplines have 
their own norms and terminology, it's also important to find 
advocates across the university's various schools and faculties. 

David also reiterates not trying to solve all the problems 
with scholarly publishing in one fell swoop: ''The policy is just 
the first step." 




Open Arts and 
Culture 




Open Arts and Culture in Aotearoa 
New Zealand 

By Elizabeth Heritage, Communications Lead, Creative Commons 
Aotearoa New Zealand 

Let's say you're an art student. You've found an artwork online 
that you want to download, print out and use in your art project. 
You're not sure who created the artwork, or what that artist 
might think about you using their work. Do you take a copy? Or 
look for something else? 

It can be difficult to know. Kiwi artists and creators have 
a problem: copyright law is getting in the way of realising the 
potential of the internet in creating and promoting their work. 
Why is this? And what kind of digital copyright culture should 
we be working towards to best support the arts? 

Let's start with what copyright in Aotearoa actually is. 
Copyright is a form of intellectual property that is granted 
by the law automatically upon creation of a work. It prevents 
people other than the creator from making copies of (including 
adapting, sharing or performing) that work without the 
creator's express permission. It is unregistered - unlike 
patents or trademarks, you don't have apply for copyright; 
you don't even have to use the little © symbol. And it lasts 
for a really long time: in Aotearoa, this is tire life of the creator 
plus fifty years, after which point the copyright expires and 
the work enters the public domain. Copyright laws were 
originally written to protect the rights of creators in their work 
and to foster a culture that rewards and promotes creativity. 



including protecting the ability of creators to earn money from 
their works for a certain period of time. 

So, for example, at the point at which you publish your 
artistic work (let's say a photograph) online, tire law grants 
you an exclusive right to control the copying and reuse of that 
work for the rest of your life plus five decades afterwards. If 
someone wishes to republish your photograph, the law says 
they must ask you for permission; that is, they must license 
your copyright from you, possibly for a fee. The law does not 
distinguish between commercial and non-commercial reuse: 
even if someone just wants to put a copy of your photograph 
in a small community newsletter, the law says they still have 
to have a licence (i.e. permission granted by you, the creator). 

The only exceptions to this rule are under what the law 
calls 'fair dealing': someone may copy your artistic work for 
the purposes of research or private study (e.g. they can print it 
out at home), they may quote from it publicly (if it's a written 
work) for purposes of criticism or review, and journalists 
can copy works for the purposes of reporting current events. 
(There are also special exceptions for specific uses like public 
administration, libraries and education.) But that's it. 'Fair 
dealing' has a very specific, narrow technical definition; it 
does not mean - as the general public seems to increasingly be 
assuming - that you can copy anything you like as long as you 
personally feel it's fair. And, unlike the US legal provision of 
'fair use'. New Zealand copyright law does not allow copying 
for the purposes of parody or satire. 




In practice - partly because the law is so restrictive and 
potentially complex and partly because making digital 
copies is just so easy - the general public tends to ignore or 
misunderstand copyright law. Unfortunately, the reaction of 
the law thus far has been to crack down, criminalising common 
behaviour, rather than seeking to distinguish between harmful 
copying (e.g. piracy) and creative, socially beneficial reuse. 
We end up with situations where people - including artists, 
or people who could become artists - are too afraid to create. 
In addition to this, because one of the fundamental technical 
functions of the internet is to create copies, digital technology 
means that copyright law applies to exponentially more 
day-to-day activities than it ever has before. As anyone who 
has ever cut and pasted an image online knows (or perhaps 
doesn't), it's become trivially easy to infringe copyright, which 
means that lots of us are technically criminals. 

All of this massively gets in the way of the extraordinary 
creative gift of tire internet: the ability to access, reuse and 
build upon the intellectual and artistic history of humanity; 
to critically and creatively engage with tire best that has been 
thought and said across the world. Not just those works that 
are available in physical copies in your local library, or have 
been chosen for you in advance by others - now everyone with 
an internet connection can access all works that have ever been 
digitised (and track down works that haven't). The internet 
has made it easier than ever before for artists to get their work 
into the world, and has also made it easier for anyone to share 




and build upon it. As we have seen, though, at the moment, 
copyright either criminalises or gets in the way of new (and old) 
forms of creative practice. 

Take gifs, for example. Gifs are a new form of digital 
art that involve animating and adding to images or video 
clips. Although based on existing artworks, they are a new 
and original form of artistic expression. But, because they 
technically involve making copies of images, copyright law 
applies. This means that the artist is legally obliged to check 
the exact provenance, rights status and licence conditions of 
each image before using it - and this is often almost impossible. 
Because you don't have to register for copyright, or even write 
your name on your work in order for copyright to apply, it can 
be incredibly difficult (and time-consuming) to track down the 
owner. And because of copyright's long-lasting nature, even 
images that are several decades old, with long-dead creators, 
may still be in copyright. 

The good news is that help is at hand. Creative Commons 
open copyright licences were designed to help creators realise 
the extraordinary potential of the internet. They are built on 
copyright law and are designed to make the most of it, cutting 
through the current situation of confusion and constriction. 
Artists can use these free licences to give a range of permissions 
in advance to anyone wishing to share or build upon their work, 
using clear rights statements that everyone can understand. 
They can also use them to forbid commercial reuse by others, 
thus retaining an exclusive right to any revenue generated by 
their works. Crucially, they can also save their works from 



entering a kind of post-commercial limbo, for example by 
choosing to let their work enter the Commons (that is, the pool 
of cultural and artistic resources available to everyone) after 
sales have died off. 

Let's think more about that aspect of copyright: the fact 
that it expires, at which point creative works enter the public 
domain, and become available for everyone to use, reuse or 
adapt - including artists. It's worth noting that public domain 

- like fair dealing - has a specific technical definition: works in 
the public domain are those whose intellectual property rights 
have expired, or been forfeited, or which never had any to 
begin with. It does not mean 'anything the public has access to' 

- and it definitely doesn't mean 'anything you can find online'. 

While the length of copyright has increased dramatically 
over the last century (it was originally just 14 years), its basic 
purpose remains the same: to incentivise creators to make new 
works that will, after a period of time, enter the Commons. 
This temporary nature recognises that, just as it is fair that 
artists be able to derive commercial gain for the works they 
create; so too it is fair that society as a whole - including the 
next generation of artists - benefits from the enrichment of the 
public domain. Framed in this way, the purpose of copyright 
is to grow the Commons. 

Many creative works have an important first, or commercial, 
life: the time during which the work is for sale and the artist 
earns revenue for it, thus enabling them to create further 
artworks. Many other creative and cultural works, though, are 
not intended to be commercial in nature. Even for those that 




are, the reality is that, for the overwhelming majority of artistic 
works, this life is very limited. Works are created; copies are 
sold to tire public; some publicity is generated; but soon, partly 
because of the sheer numbers produced every day, interest dies 
off. When sales inevitably decline, it stops making commercial 
sense to keep producing and marketing copies of the works 
for sale. And then the works enter a sort of limbo, when the 
artist (or publisher) isn't making the work available or deriving 
commercial use from it, but copyright law says that - possibly 
for the next century - no one else can use it either. Suddenly, 
without anyone intending it to be this way, huge quantities of 
artworks are buried and lost. 

Of equal cultural importance, then, is the works' non- 
commercial life, sometimes called their 'second' life: their life 
in the Commons, and of being creatively reused in new ways 
completely unimagined by the original creator. In order for 
society to grow and develop, it is vital that we all have access 
to information about the world around us and knowledge of 
others' experience - including artistic expression. This is where 
places like libraries, archives and other record-keeping bodies 
come in. These are the places that keep works alive long after 
their commercial potential has been exhausted. Importantly, 
they are also places where people who can't afford to purchase 
the works can still access, learn from, and be inspired by them. 

So far, we've just been discussing creative works produced 
by individual artists, with copyright that is privately 
owned. But what about state-funded creative works? TVNZ 
programmes, for example? Currently, most of New Zealand's 



publicly funded or publicly housed cultural heritage is 
unavailable for reuse by Kiwis. Despite ongoing digitisation 
projects, these works are neither commercially available 
nor publicly reusable. This means that creators who want 
to build on the works of the past - from student filmmakers 
to non-profit documentary producers - are either forced to 
reinvent the wheel or go through a difficult process of asking 
permission, even when the original works are publicly funded 
and publicly housed and its creators are long deceased. 

A better system would ensure that publicly funded copyright 
works were, after a period of time, made publicly available 
under an open Creative Commons licence. This would provide a 
window of time for works to be commercialised, while ensuring 
that older, no longer commercially viable works were able to 
be shared and reused by the New Zealand public - effectively 
giving publicly funded culture a second life. 

Artists and creators are increasingly turning to Creative 
Commons copyright licences - especially online - because they 
provide an easy and legally robust manner to declare what 
kinds of copying and reuse the artist permits, and which they 
do not. There are both philosophical and practical motivations 
for this: artists want to participate in the Commons, and 
they also want to harness the power of the internet to get 
their works to their audience. In an increasingly crowded 
marketplace, obscurity is a bigger problem than piracy . 1 The

licence is particularly popular - this means that casual reuse is 
permitted, which helps spread the word, but commercial reuse 
is not, which helps protect the artist's revenue. 

Part of expecting people to respect your copyright is to 
respect the copyright of others - and here again, Creative 
Commons can help. There are now hundreds of millions of 
openly licensed artistic works online, which means that artists 
have an extraordinary pool to draw from when creating their 
own remix artworks, from digital collages to electronic music 
sampling to meme-worthy gifs. Google now allows you to 
search by licence condition, so artists can seek out and use 
resources online, confident that they are acting legally and are 
respecting the rights choices of their fellow artists. The rise of 
Creative Commons as an everyday part of internet culture also 
means that everyone gets used to checking the rights status of a 
work and obeying the licence conditions, rather than seeing 'All 
Rights Reserved' and just choosing to ignore it because it's too 
hard. Everybody wins. 

This part of the book examines some of the ways Kiwi 
artists are using Creative Commons to navigate the complex 
terrain of copyright in the digital age. Keep reading to learn 
why, what benefits these are bringing, and how you can enjoy 
some wonderful homegrown talent. 




Illustrating with Creative Commons 

By Judith Carnaby, Illustrator 

I first became aware of Creative Commons through reading 
about Lawrence Lessig and his work. The more I read about the 
development of Creative Commons and the copyleft movement, 
the more interested I became in the Creative Commons licences 
as a less restrictive and more inclusive way to license my work. 

My first illustrations published under a CC licence were 
for Sam Muirhead's 2013 Year of Open Source swimsuit 
calendar, created as a part of his crowdfunding campaign. 
My illustrations for the calendar were of the heroes and 
heroines of Free Software, Open Hardware and Free Culture, 
depicting some of the people who have done the most to 
exemplify or further the cause of a more open, collaborative or 
more freedom-conscious approach to working, thinking and 
licensing. 

It was sent as a thank-you to Sam's crowdfunding donors, 
and due to his focus on Open Source, he also wished to release 
the images online, with a Creative Commons Attribution- 
Share Alike (CC BY-SA) licence, so that people could download, 
remix and distribute the images. Working with Sam and 
learning about the people I was illustrating made me think 
a lot more about the licensing I used for my own work, and 
since then I have licensed my personal (non-commercial) work 
under an Attribution-ShareAlike licence. 

I chose that particular licence because I like that the 
Attribution-ShareAlike licence gives others the freedom to 



be able to use my work in any way they wish to, but only if 
they then allow others to use that work in the same way. By 
including the ShareAlike restriction in the licence, if someone 
wishes to use my work commercially then they must also open 
up their own work, which I feel is a positive thing. 

One of the most interesting recent developments for 
illustration has been the large-scale and high-resolution releases 
of public domain images from the collections of institutions in the 
Netherlands, the UK and New York City. Having a huge wealth 
of unrestricted imagery that can be used and remixed opens up 
new ways of working, as well as deepening understanding of 
the history and development of illustration as a discipline. More 
broadly, these online collections of illustrations give us greater 
and important access to the world's cultural history. 

In my personal work I can choose to license as I wish, but 
my commercial work is often restricted due to tire different 
needs of my clients. Copyright of commissioned illustrations 
usually belongs to me, the author of the work, unless there is an 
agreement for specific use of the illustration. This can depend on 
how clients want to use the work, and for what length of time. For 
example, they may wish to use the image online for two months, 
or two years, after which I can resell or republish it as I wish. 
Contracts can include agreements that I, or the client, cannot 
use the illustration for any purpose other than what was agreed 
upon. Using copyright agreements often protects an illustrator 
from being taken advantage of, but most businesses have a 
limited view of what copyright means and can unnecessarily 




restrict an illustrator's right (or sometimes need) to reuse, remix 
or resell an image. 

I like to work with clients who are aware of Creative 
Commons licences and use them in their own businesses. For 
example, I created the cover design for Thomasin Sleigh's novel 
Ad Lib, which was published under a Creative Commons licence. 
Another example is the info-video for a bicycle sharing platform, 
BikeSurf Berlin. To me it makes complete sense to license my 
work in this way. 




Ad Lib: Novel Published Under GG 



Author Thomasin Sleigh has published her debut novel Ad 
Lib under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial- 
ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) licence, with the publishing 
collective Lawrence &amp; Gibson. 

Thomasin's work at DigitalNZ A-tihi o Aotearoa to open 
up Aotearoa's cultural treasures for sharing and reuse has 
informed her decision to license her own work under CC. 
"Publishing Ad Lib under a Creative Commons licence was 
very much an ideological decision. I am an advocate for 
unlocking cultural resources and, even though my book is 
published in paper format at the moment, and so is relatively 
difficult to copy compared to an ebook, I wanted to contribute 
to the Creative Commons." 

Thomasin has chosen a licence that gives people advance 
permission to use her work in their own creations, as long as 
they attribute her and don't make money from it. "Because I 
don't write fiction for a living, I have the freedom to release 
my work in a way that might be more difficult for professional 
novelists." She is also concerned with future-proofing. "The 
media landscape is only going to change, and keep changing 
ever more rapidly. I don't want there to be any confusion in the 
future about how my work is to be treated." Fundamentally, 
Thomasin sees potential reuse as a compliment, not a threat: 
"If anyone wanted to use or copy from Ad Lib, I would be 
genuinely flattered." 




Publishing a paper book under a Creative Commons 
licence is relatively unusual, and Thomasin was lucky to 
be published by Lawrence &amp; Gibson, a Wellington-based 
publishing collective that is open to new and experimental 
ways of doing things. The cover for Ad Lib was designed by 
Berlin-based illustrator Judith Carnaby, who licenses her work 
under Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike (CC BY-SA). 

The printing for Ad Lib was done by hand at Rebel Press, an 
anarchist publishing collective that also offers printing services. 
Thomasin says that the print irregularities resulting from this 
handmade process are "love letters from me to the reader". 

If Ad Lib were to be published as an ebook in the future, 
Thomasin says she would definitely license it CC BY-NC-SA 
as well. As well as opening up her own work, Thomasin's 
licensing decision has exposed publishers at Lawrence &amp; 
Gibson to the possibilities of book publishing with Creative 
Commons, so hopefully we will see more of that from them in 
the future. 




Meena Kadri: Creative Commons 
and Photography 

Meena Kadri is a Wellington-based photographer, designer 
and Community Manager for OpenIDEO, a collaborative 
innovation and design platform. 

A long-time user of Flickr (under tire name Meanest Indian), 
Meena releases many of her photos under a Creative Commons 
Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives (CC BY-NC-ND) 
licence. Her CC-licensed images have appeared in a variety of 
newspapers, magazines, blogs and books, and have been licensed 
for commercial use by companies like Phaidon and Apple. 

Despite this success, Meena confesses, "I never actually 
intended to sell my photos - 1 just wanted to put them online. 
But pretty soon I realised the potential." 

While teaching at India's National Institute of Design in the 
mid-2000s, Meena started using Flickr to source high-quality 
images for her presentations; by 2006, she was using Flickr to 
share her own photos. "Flickr was the first social network I'd 
ever used. I realised pretty quickly how to optimise traffic to 
my site using tags, especially because I was taking photos of 
events that were both in demand but under-photographed, 
such as the Uttarayan Kite Festival in India. It didn't take long 
to get my photos on the front page of Flickr image search for 
certain topics." 

A direct result of the popularity of Meena's Flickr account 
is that her images have featured in countless blogs and 
presentations. For-profit companies have also paid to use 



her work, including Serendib, the magazine of Sri Lankan 
Airlines, and Phaidon Books, who included ten of her images 
in an Indian cookbook. Meena explains, "What I usually do 
in these situations is negotiate. For those people with little or 
no money, such as NGOs, I usually say go for it. For others, I 
ask, 'Are you getting paid?'. The implication is that if they are 
getting paid, then I should be getting paid as well. For them, I 
charge my standard rate." 

Meena even licensed one of her CC-licensed photos to 
Apple, her biggest sale so far. At the same time, Meena ensures 
that images sold to for-profit companies like Apple and Phaidon 
remain available for reuse under their original non-commercial 
Creative Commons licence. 

As Meena's images grew in popularity, she experimented 
with using Getty, a stock image service. While she made a small 
amount of money from the service, Meena "didn't like that they 
required you to use All Rights Reserved. I tried it, because they 
do move a lot of images, but in the end I decided that I preferred 
using Creative Commons on Flickr." 

One reason for this is that Creative Commons licences require 
attribution, which is not the case with stock image services like 
Getty. As Meena explains, "The Creative Commons licences 
mean that I receive a lot of traffic from having lots of sites - from 
major technology blogs like Wired to smaller community blogs 
with loyal followers - link back to my Flickr page." 

While Meena is keen to emphasise that the upsides of using 
Creative Commons licensing greatly outweigh tire downsides, 
she has noticed her images being used without proper 



attribution. "Every now and then, I'll find unattributed images 
and send a nice email asking for attribution. It's important 
to be nice, as a lot of people genuinely don't know how the 
licences work. I tend to assume it's a mistake, and send them a 
link to the licence page." 

Other uses have been more problematic. While visiting 
her father's hometown in India, Meena opened a major local 
newspaper to find one of her images used - for commercial 
purposes and without attribution - to advertise the upcoming 
Kite Festival. Meena got in touch with the newspaper, pointed 
out that they did not have a licence for commercial reuse, and 
was eventually paid her standard rate. 

To prevent unlicensed commercial reuse, Meena only puts 
web-quality images on her Flickr page. This means that her 
images are good enough for blogs or slideshow presentations; 
those wanting to use her images for books or posters, however, 
will need to ask for a higher resolution. 

As a Google Image search for 'Meanest Indian' reveals, 
Meena's CC-licensed photos are being freely reused all over 
the web. At the same time, for-profit companies are continuing 
to pay to license her work for commercial purposes - a great 
example of artists making money using Creative Commons 
Noncommercial licences. 




Richard White: Openly Licensing 
Music 

Richard White is an interesting example of an artist using 
Creative Commons to make his own creative output available, 
while working in a job that clearly demonstrates the pitfalls 
and possibilities of copyright and Open Access (OA) day in 
and day out. 

Richard has made two of his albums available for download 
on Bandcamp, under the name Mermaid Guitar. He began 
by offering his earlier album. Me for a Day, with a five dollar 
price tag, and then decided to offer Barry Starr for free, with 
the 'name your price' function, where users choose how much 
they'd like to pay. 

Despite being available for free, the second album has had 
more downloads and more sales - so he's now offering the 
earlier album under the same terms. For Richard, this makes 
the process of selling an album more exciting. As he puts it, 
''People have paid a lot more than I thought they might, more 
than the five dollars I initially offered the first album for." 

Plenty of others have downloaded his music for free, but 
Richard says that he's totally happy with this. "Ultimately I 
just like the idea that someone's listening to my music on their 
iPod on the other side of the world." But he's also careful to 
point out that he doesn't try to make a living from his music and 
concedes that, for those who do, there are greater challenges. 

As part of the production process, Richard sourced all 
artwork for Barry Starr from Public Domain or Creative 



Commons sources, but he says finding images which could 
be used with the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 
(CC BY-SA) licence he used for the album, which also fit his 
purpose, was trickier than he thought. 

"There were some great images I really liked, but they 
had either ND (NoDerivatives) or, more commonly, NC 
(Noncommercial)," Richard says. "Given that people could 
pay, I couldn't use NC. I guess the difficulty I had finding good 
stuff showed me that Open Access is still at the 'evangelical' 
stage in many respects and we need more converts for it to 
become more self-sustaining." 

By day, Richard works as Copyright Manager at the 
University of Otago Te Whare Wananga o Otago, addressing 
any copyright issues or questions encountered by staff and 
research students there. This can be a challenge: while most 
staff have an understanding of the broad concepts of copyright, 
it can be a complex web of legislation, licences and rights. 

Richard has found himself a staunch advocate of Open 
Access in the tertiary sector and Creative Commons as the 
main vehicle for that. "Creative Commons licences simplify a 
lot of things from a copyright point of view," he says. "Often 
a staff member or a PhD student will come to me or one of our 
library staff with questions about permission for something 
they want to use in a piece of research. One of tire most 
common problems is that they just don't hear from someone 
they've contacted to get permission." 

He says accessibility is often the last tiring researchers and 
academics are thinking about. They're used to things being 



done a certain way and aren't necessarily aware of the Open 
Access alternatives. Their reputations as academics are affected 
by how often they're being published in scholarly journals, and 
the quality of those journals is taken into account too. 

"That's the major roadblock for Open Access publications, 
just getting enough visibility and usage to attract good quality 
research, to gain a name as a good journal, not just an Open 
Access journal. I mean, I'd love it if all research was open." 

Other countries are mandating that all publicly funded 
research should be open - the US Government, for example -but 
New Zealand isn't making any moves yet. Instead academics 
do their research, write it up, submit it for publication, go 
through tire peer review process and are accepted into these 
big journals where they're published, which universities 
around the world then pay subscription fees to access. 

He appreciates the freedom Creative Commons licences 
give both creator and reuser, academic and artistic. "When 
someone has used a Creative Commons licence they've 
declared up front what they're happy for others to do with 
their work. So part of my work is helping people understand 
the implications of their choices with their own work as part of 
the knowledge ecosystem. 

"In that respect it's no different from choosing Creative 
Commons in an artistic medium: you're sharing your work for 
others to use and build on. I can't claim that my music has 
informed great cultural achievements but there are people 
who've put it in compilations or used it in their films, which is 
immensely satisfying." 



The Vertical Cinema Manifesto 



In June 2012, YouTube user 'gloveandboots' released "Vertical 
Video Syndrome - A PSA", a video poking fun at filmmakers 
who hold their camera-phone vertically. Common across 
YouTube, videos shot vertically have two black bands of empty 
space framing tire video. 

"Vertical Video Syndrome" quickly went viral, picking up 
over three million views on YouTube. Noticing the popularity 
of the video, Miriam Ross - an academic and filmmaker based 
in Wellington, New Zealand - decided to respond. With 
research assistant Maddy Glen, Miriam produced "Vertical 
Cinema Manifesto ", arguing that vertical cinema was, in fact, 
a legitimate cinematic form. 

As Miriam explains, '"Vertical Video Syndrome' was very 
humorous, but when you see it getting circulated online, it's 
used as a form of policing. 

"We wanted to get away from that. We wanted to say, we 
have all these new tools, let's see what can happen. It's all very 
experimental. Hopefully the manifesto is a celebration of what 
can be done." 

Replete with quotes from feminist film scholar Laura Mulvey, 
the result was a close parody of "Vertical Video Syndrome " . The 
film closes with six recommendations, the fourth of which reads: 
"A Creative Commons licence must be used." 

The ideas around the manifesto tied into an Honours film 
course Miriam was teaching at the time on DIY filmmaking. 
"That paper framed the project. Part of that is trying to move 



away from the hierarchies around filmmaking - the idea that 
there's a 'best way' to make films. 

"We were looking at how people use the technology they 
have in their hands to make films with no budget or resources. 
Obviously, with DIY filmmaking the Creative Commons 
licences became very interesting. It tied into both tire courses 
I teach and our project. Because we've got no money, we've 
been wanting to find material we can use for free. But we also 
want to take part in this Creative Commons culture that's going 
round now, where people are licensing their work for free." 

Miriam is also interested in how DIY filmmakers remix and 
reuse other cultural works. "There's a lot of debate now, because 
video essays are becoming more popular. Film academics are 
using video clips, and sometimes using voiceover to narrate 
the clips, and that could come up against copyright." 

As Miriam points out, one of the problems is that 
New Zealand lacks the broad 'fair use' allowances enjoyed 
in the US. Even "Vertical Cinema Manifesto" itself, which 
uses small parts of several copyright films, could occupy a 
grey area, despite New Zealand's 'fair dealing' exceptions for 
criticism and review. 

"It is tricky. One of the things I teach in my course is 
mash-ups and video remixes. They are a huge part of our 
contemporary culture, and they're all operating in this grey 
area. It's strange because the companies, especially film 
companies, want their films talked about. The mash-ups 
are often a form of advertising for them, but they still aren't 
promoting this sort of use." 



More recently, Miriam and Maddy produced Heaven, a 
short 'vertical' film. "It's an exploration of what we can do 
with very little resources and money, using new technologies." 

This film, like the manifesto itself, was made collaboratively 
with friends and colleagues and carries a Creative Commons 
Attribution (CC BY) licence. 

"That's what's great about Creative Commons. It 
encourages people to take something and just see what they 
can do with it. That's the kind of spirit I want to see more 
of. Instead of trying to be an auteur starting from scratch to 
make something unique and singular, why not build on what 
other people are doing to create something that's maybe more 
hybrid, but maybe more exciting as a result?" 




Jem Yoshioka: Openly Licensed 
Digital Art 

In 2010, Jem Yoshioka decided to enter Mix &amp; Mash, then a new 
initiative from DigitalNZ A-tihi o Aotearoa and the National 
Library of New Zealand Te Puna Matauranga o Aotearoa. 
Reusing Katherine Mansfield's poem 'An Opal Dream Cave', 
Jem produced a short comic of tire same name. 

With this entry, Jem won the Creative Commons category 
of Mix &amp; Mash. As Jem relates, "That was when I began to 
think about how I could use Creative Commons material in my 
work, and also start licensing my own work under Creative 
Commons." 

"I then decided to open up my Flickr stream. Now, 
everything I put online I license under Creative Commons." 

The comics on Jem's website, including 'An Opal Dream 
Cave' and 'Sunshine', are all made available under a Creative 
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) licence. Many 
more photos, illustrations, comics and sketches are made 
available under the same licence on her Flickr stream. 

As Jem explains, "I use Creative Commons for many 
reasons, one of them being that I really do believe that 
copyright is outdated, especially given the way we can share 
things online. It becomes more of a burden than anything. 
Instead of encouraging creativity, it begins to block it. 

"By using an open licence, it actually gives me a lot more 
freedom to say what I want done with my work. I don't have 




to worry about people infringing my rights, as if s very clear 
what can be done with my work." 

Jem chose to use the ShareAlike licence so "everyone that 
uses my work is also contributing to Creative Commons. It's 
a way of increasing the pool of work and encouraging the 
conversation. 

"The ShareAlike licence is a way for me to contribute to the 
Creative Commons environment." 

Unlike some artists, like Dylan Horrocks, Jem chose 
not to apply a Noncommercial licence to her work. As she 
explains, "People can make money off my work. I'm really 
not too fussed about that; as long as it's got my name on it, 
they can do whatever they like. I'd rather it be shared. The 
ShareAlike aspect of the licence means anything that is made, 
even commercially, also has to be ShareAlike. If a big company 
wants to use my work, they're doing so while contributing to 
Creative Commons. 

"Being a part of a community also helps me to get a bit 
more traction for my freelance work. This model doesn't take 
money away from me. It engages and connects people even 
more with what I do." 

Jem is also a trustee of the Creative Freedom Foundation, 
joining other Creative Commons supporters, including Dan 
Untitled, Bronwyn Holloway-Smith, Matthew Holloway and 
Luke Rowell of Disasteradio. 




Open Source and Creative Commons in 
the Pine Arts 



Bronwyn Holloway-Smith is an artist and arts advocate based 
in Wellington, interested in "internet culture, 3-dimensional 
printing, open source art and space colonisation". 

In 2009 Bronwyn produced 'Ghosts in the Form of Gifts', 
a permanent installation at Massey University Te Kunenga 
Ki Purehuroa, which won the 2010 Award for Open Source 
in the Arts. The installation presents replicas of artefacts 
imagined as "lost, hidden or misregistered" from the Museum 
of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. The objects were made 
using an Open Source 3-dimensional printer known as the 
'RepRap'. The digital files were licensed as Creative Commons 
Attribution-Share Alike (CC BY-SA), and were made available 
for download on her website. 

Bronwyn also uploaded the files to Thingiverse, an online 
repository for digital design. Within a month, someone from 
Chicago's What It Is gallery had been in touch. Without the 
usual fuss of shipping and handling, the gallery had printed 
an object for inclusion in their 2012 show, 'Improbable Objects' 
- all without Bronwyn having to leave Wellington. 

As she puts it, "Using Creative Commons licences has 
opened up new opportunities for connecting with and 
engaging audiences and getting my work seen around 
the world ... Traditional copyright can be a brick wall that 
discourages people from engaging." She points out that while 




New Zealand is geographically isolated, Creative Commons 
licences can link artists to international communities. 

Bronwyn believes that more exciting uses of Creative 
Commons in the arts have yet to be discovered. She says, "I'm 
really interested in the new potential it represents. Its potential 
in the arts hasn't been fully realised." Bronwyn points out 
that Creative Commons licences are still relatively new. She 
describes her projects as "experiments", with the licences 
a way of "allowing others to discover new exciting uses for 
creative works that I can't predict". 

Her 2011 project 'Pioneer City', which imagines future real 
estate opportunities on Mars, was re-imagined by tire kids in 
Room 11 at Lyall Bay School, after reading an article on the 
project in local newspaper the Wellingtonian. 

For the exhibition 'The Obstinate Object: Contemporary 
New Zealand Sculpture', at City Gallery Wellington, Bronwyn 
returned to 3D printing, developing a new work titled 
'Whisper Down The Lane'. For this piece, she collaborated 
with designers Ant Pelosi and Nick Graham, using Autodesk 
123D Catch and Xbox Kinect programme ReconstructMe to 
make digital files of other works exhibited in the gallery, 
releasing the files for free download on Thingiverse and 
creating miniature 3D prints of the works with the RepRap. 
For this project, she chose a Creative Commons Attribution- 
NonCommercial-Share Alike (CC BY-NC-SA) licence, as 
using a non-commercial licence "helped keep the other artists 
comfortable with the project". 




In 2008, Bronwyn co-founded the Creative Freedom 
Foundation (CFF), anon-profit organisation that represents over 
10,000 New Zealand artists. The CFF works with government 
officials and politicians to ensure that New Zealand artists 
have a voice in discussions over New Zealand's intellectual 
property legislation. Bronwyn says, "Many New Zealand 
artists rely on the internet ... Any changes to legislation may 
mean a huge deal to these artists." 

While using Creative Commons licences primarily allows 
her work to be reused and remixed, it also introduces issues of 
copyright and digital technology to artists and arts audiences. 
"Creative Commons starts a conversation about intellectual 
property, which can be really useful." Referencing artists like 
Marcel Duchamp, Bronwyn explains, "Art is not an island, 
operating independently of what's been made in the past. 
Remix, appropriation, parody: these techniques have been 
used in art for centuries. We're always building on works 
we've had access to." 




Jon Lemmon: Creative Commons 
Music in Aotearoa 

Jon Lemmon is a songwriter and musician based in Wellington, 
New Zealand. His album, Demos/Sketches, was released in 2011 
under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC 
BY-NC) licence. 

Jon then used the same licence to release his other albums, 
including Singles, Kindling EP and Steppenivolf, also available 
for free download. 

Jon says that he uses Creative Commons for "everything, 
really. I'm a bedroom producer, and do all of it on my computer 
- recording, writing songs, singing, all of that - and to me, it 
didn't really ever seem like a question whether or not I'd use 
Creative Commons." 

Jon was encouraged to use Creative Commons licensing by 
VBC radio host Kim Wheatley, host of 'Compulsory Ecstasy', 
who was living with Jon at the time. Kim was reading Cory 
Doctorow and saw open licensing as an interesting way for Jon 
to release his music. 

Jon points out that most bedroom artists don't spend much 
time thinking about copyright. "If you're young enough, you 
just assume everything's fair game, especially if you grew 
up with bands like GirlTalk. In the underground scene, the 
blogosphere and stuff like that, if it's not mainstream, it seems 
like people don't really care about copyright. 

"As an artist, I find copyright really obnoxious. I'm really 
interested in the idea of people sharing their music, so that 



people can do whatever they want with it, and what you end 
up producing is a great mix of a whole bunch of work. 

"There was no question there, I wanted to open the 
album up for remix." 

Opening up the album, however, required more than just a 
Creative Commons licence. "You still only have a full song, and 
you don't have the individual tracks and parts to sample. One 
of the most recent songs - 'Exodus' - 1 released the individual 
tracks for it as well, just in case anyone wanted to do anything 
with any of it. 

"No one ever commented on it, and I didn't even know if 
anyone even saw it or used it at all, but then randomly I was 
at a show, and some person came up to me and said, 'Hey, I 
really like your music. It was so awesome that you released all 
the tracks for that one song. I've been playing around with it.'" 

Jon, however, is quick to point out that the purpose of 
Creative Commons is to provide a legal framework for a culture 
of sharing, remix and reuse that already exists. As Jon puts it, 
"Cultural protection always works better than legal protection." 

Other examples of reuse include Jon and New Zealand duo 
Wet Wings remixing each other's openly licensed work. 

In 2011 Jon found out that "someone had done an edit of 
my song and put it on YouTube, which was cool." 

"I agreed, so he said, 'We'll put your original on, my remix 
on and then we'll do a version together and put that on, too.' 
So that's what we did." 

The record was released by Car Crash Set in 2011. "That's 
the only one of my tracks that's available from a record label." 



Jon found Creative Commons particularly useful in 
specifying exactly what kinds of permissions he wanted to 
allow. "I want to be able to make sure everyone can edit this. 
But if someone tries to profit from my music, I want to be able 
to set the terms. That was actually really nice - it meant that I 
was safe, legally." 

On the topic of whether the culture of remix among 
bedroom producers included providing attribution, Jon says, 
"You'd be stupid not to. It's about building relationships. 
Creative Commons - that concept - is just sensible . . . It's the 
sensible way to do things." 




Dylan Horrocks: Creative Commons 
Cartoons 

Based in Auckland, Dylan Horrocks is best known as the 
author of the award-winning Hicksville, a story of a small, 
comics-obsessed town on New Zealand's East Coast. Hicksville 
was named a 'book of the year' by Comics Journal and features 
in Auckland University Press's Anthology of New Zealand 
Literature, alongside canonical New Zealand writers James K 
Baxter, Maurice Gee and Katherine Mansfield. 

Dylan is also a long-time supporter of Creative Commons . In 
fact, since 2009, Dylan has been releasing his work on his website 
under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC 
BY-NC) licence. Readers can find finished stories and ongoing 
serials, including Sam Zabel and the Magic Pen. 

Dylan first became interested in the relationship between 
copyright and culture when, as a young comics reader, he 
saw how many authors had lost the rights to their works - 
including Siegel and Shuster, the creators of Superman, who 
sold their work to National Periodicals (later, DC Comics). 

Dylan relates, "When freelancers got paid in the early 
comics industry, they had to sign the back of the cheque to 
cash it. On the back of the cheque, though, was a printed 
statement, which basically said, 'All rights to this story and the 
characters contained therein are hereby handed in perpetuity 
to the publisher.' 

"The key lesson was: never sell your copyright to a company. 
For a long time, my view of copyright was that it was very. 



very important for the artist and that you must hold on to it, no 
matter what." 

Dylan's view of copyright changed when, in the process 
of researching a guest lecture for Auckland University, he 
realised the potential effects of the internet on the production 
and distribution of culture. 

"I kind of had this revelation: the ease with which media 
can be copied when it's digital, and the ease with which it can 
be distributed through the internet, offers us an extraordinary 
historic opportunity. 

"Surely we've always dreamed of a civilisation in which 
everyone has access to ideas, without the constraint of 
shipping piles of paper around tire world. As an afterthought, I 
considered how that would affect the economics of distribution. 
Having thought about that, I concluded that it might mean the 
end of royalties. I think it took me two minutes to decide that 
I was fine with that." 

Dylan realised that the internet had the potential to expand 
public access to our rich cultural heritage, including comics. 
"I've spent much of my life hearing rumours of a really 
interesting comics project, or catching a glimpse of it in some 
history book about comics, and thinking, I wish I could get my 
hands on that, and then working so hard looking for ways to 
access it." 

Dylan talks about Finnish writer and cartoonist Tove 
Jansson, best known as the inventor of the Moomins. For years, 
Dylan was unaware that Jansson had drawn a comic strip, until 
he came across a reference to her in a German history of comics. 



After receiving a photocopy of the comic from historian Paul 
Gravett, Dylan decided to run off 30 more copies and give them 
away to other cartoonists around the world. 

“Eventually, a few years later, my publisher, Drawn and 
Quarterly, started republishing those comics. They're selling 
really well and it's rewriting the history of comics." 

With the internet, these practices of sharing and reuse are 
becoming increasingly common. As Dylan puts it, "This is 
a fantastic gift to the whole culture. I have access to a vastly 
greater landscape of recorded culture than any previous 
generation, and that's going to change the way artists work. I 
already see it in the work of younger artists." 

By using a Creative Commons licence on his own work, 
Dylan hopes to encourage younger artists to remix and adapt 
their own version of The American Dream or Sam Zabel and the 
Magic Pen. 

As Dylan puts it, "I don't object to people sharing my work 
and I don't object to people using my work as an inspiration 
for new work, because both for me are really gratifying. It 
shows that people are engaging with my work and they're 
excited by it. 

"If people are sharing it around, more people are reading 
it. The idea that it's inspiring other people to do new work is 
gratifying, especially because my work in turn is inspired by 
other people." 

Creative Commons provides Dylan with an alternative 
to what he sees as a narrow, but dominant, vision of culture 
and art. "When I make a piece of art, it's me responding to a 



whole lot of art and the world around me. When I finish it, I 
want it to go back into that flow of art and ideas, and be shared 
and responded to by people. Treating it as a single piece of 
property seems wrong. Lots of people have a relationship to 
that piece of art." 

Dylan decided to apply a Noncommercial licence, to 
ensure that commercial publishers wouldn't distribute his 
work without his express permission. 

"Part of what appeals to me about Creative Commons is that 
the Creative Commons licence that I prefer - which tends to be 
Attribution-NonCommercial - far more accurately reflects my 
preference as an author about how my work is used. The idea 
of some 14-year-old getting to read their work and not paying 
them really doesn't bug most writers. We don't want to put 
walls up around our work. We just don't want people getting 
rich off it without us. 

"Creative Commons doesn't actually take any of the rights 
I care about as an author. If someone wants to make a big 
Hollywood film or sell t-shirts, they can get in touch, just as 
they can under all-rights-reserved copyright. And if there is 
going to be money changing hands then some of that money 
should be coming to me." 

Currently, Dylan's printed comics are not released under 
a Creative Commons licence. While acknowledging that open 
licensing could actually increase sales, he notes that many 
publishers continue to be cautious about copyright. "The fact 
that I'm serialising stuff online while I'm working on it does 
cause problems with publishers. It's an ongoing process. That's 



something for the Creative Commons community to help with 
- helping artists who want to use Creative Commons to find 
ways to bring publishers and traditional distributors onboard." 

Dylan hopes that his use of Creative Commons licences on 
his website will encourage young artists to share and adapt his 
work. "If my comic is photocopied or scanned by a teenager 
and given to their friend - man, I love that. Or if someone 
wants to make a t-shirt of my comic to give as a present for 
Christmas, go for it. Creative Commons reflects my own 
personal ethics about how my work is used." 




Open 

Government 
and Data 



Open Government Information and 
Bata in New Zealand 

By Keitha Booth, Director, New Zealand Open Government 
Information and Data Programme 

Open government, which holds that citizens have the right to 
access the documents and proceedings of their government 
to allow for effective public oversight, has three important 
aspects: transparency, participation and collaboration. Many 
countries, including New Zealand, now embrace these 
through their international Open Government Partnership 
commitments. 1 

The history of open government in New Zealand 
Aotearoa began in the latter half of the twentieth century. 
The Parliamentary Commissioner (Ombudsman) Act 1962 set 
the scene by giving the Ombudsmen wide rights of access to 
departmental files, and making failure by a state agency to 
give reasons for any decision to refuse information one of the 
grounds on which an Ombudsman could intervene. At that 
time, the Official Secrets Act 1951, which made the release of 
information held by Government agencies an offence, was still 
in force. 

During the 1970s many civil society groups argued for 
more public debate on government business and better access 
to government-held information. The Coalition for Open 
Government played a leading role in the development of the 
Official Information Act 1982 (OIA). 2

The OIA was foreshadowed by the 1980 report of the 
Committee on Official Information, known as the Danks 
Committee (named after its Chairman), Towards Open 
Government. 3 The Act implemented most of its recommendations. 
It repealed the Official Secrets Act 1951 and it promotes access to 
information held by various government agencies. Its guiding 
principle is that information should be made available unless a 
good reason exists under the Act for withholding it. 

The New Zealand Open Government Data and information 
movement built on these foundations and has also paralleled 
international activities, particularly in the US, UK and Australia. 
Important international measures include President Obama's 
Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government, 
issued on 21 January 2009, and the development of the public 
data directory data.gov. Australia and the United Kingdom 
followed quickly with their own statements and also set up 
websites listing their governments' public data. 

In New Zealand there was pressure from civil society 
groups who were watching international developments. 
Active users of technology and the internet expected to 
participate in public policy development and to have 
government services reorganised around their needs. In 
particular, they wanted to find and use government's public 
information and data online - in the same way as they used 
online content in their personal lives - and to use it to create 
new apps, tools, services, research and knowledge. In other 
words, these developers wanted to innovate using publicly 



3 www.teara.govt. nz/en/freedom-of-official-information/page-i 




funded data. To illustrate what they wanted, they created a 
catalogue of government's public datasets. 

Around the same time, OECD ministers set international 
public sector information policy promoting wider use and 
reuse of public sector information in 2008. 4 This provided the 
catalyst for New Zealand to move ahead formally. 

Government's first response in November 2009 was 
the website data.govt.nz, developed by the Department of 
Internal Affairs Te Tari Taiwhenua, which lists government's 
public datasets. All data listed on this site is in an open format, 
although much of it in 2015 has still to be released in fully 
open data formats. Some is downloadable as Application 
Programming Interfaces (APIs) or web services. 

Between 2010 and 2011, Cabinet also approved three 
information policies, with this work initially led by the State 
Services Commission, then the Department of Internal Affairs 
and more recently at Land Information New Zealand. 

The Declaration on Open and Transparent Government, 2011, 
states that: "Building on New Zealand's democratic tradition, 
the government commits to actively releasing high value 
public data" and that "the government holds data on behalf of 
the New Zealand public. We release it to enable the private and 
community sectors to use it to grow the economy, strengthen 
our social and cultural fabric, and sustain our environment. We 
release it to encourage business and community involvement in 
government decision-making." 5 Government departments are

Sector Information. [C(2oo8)36]

transparent-government 



directed to release high-value public data that their users wish 
to reuse and all other government agencies are encouraged or 
invited to do so. 

The New Zealand Data and Information Management 
Principles, 2011, state that "Government data and information 
should be open, readily available, well managed, reasonably 
priced and re-usable unless there are necessary reasons for its 
protection. Personal and classified information will remain 
protected. Government data and information should also be 
trusted and authoritative. Whilst fully requiring personal and 
classified information to be protected, remaining government- 
held information and data must be open." 6 

The New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing 
framework (NZGOAL), 2010 7 is "guidance to assist government 
agencies publishing information and data for legal reuse. It 
was prepared to encourage full use and re-use of this material 
for economic, environmental, creative or cultural purposes 
and to encourage experts and others to contribute to improved 
policy development and more efficient financial performance 
by government." 

NZGOAL recommends that agencies apply Creative 
Commons licences to the copyright works they are releasing 
for reuse, and a no known rights statement to non-copyright 
works. The Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence is 
the recommended default licence. Use of this internationally 
adopted suite of Creative Commons licences allows agencies

information-management-principles 

7 www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open- 
access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework 



to encourage widespread legal reuse of open government 
information and data without any need to draw up their own 
contracts. Agencies are guided through a review and release 
process that helps them to assign the appropriate licence. 

In 2013 the New Zealand government released its first 
Open Government Partnership Action Plan 2014-2016, stating 
that: "New Zealand works hard to maintain and build upon 
the foundation stones that foster trust in government. We 
continuously strive to: maintain high levels of integrity; 
foster a culture of openness and freedom of information 
and public accountability; and protect personal information 
and confidential government information. We also require 
a culture of service to the public and responsiveness to 
the public's needs, concerns and complaints; merit-based 
appointments; free and frank advice and unbiased action; and 
ensure judicial independence. We expect public officials and 
institutions to be free from corruption and conflicts of interest; 
make ethically based decisions and provide leadership. This 
continued vigilance contributes to New Zealand's reputation 
for integrity, openness and a corruption-free government." 

This first plan sets out a series of actions, and will be 
updated regularly in collaboration with civil society. 




who is using Open Government Bata? 



Since the adoption of the Declaration on Open and Transparent 
Government in August 2011, New Zealand's government 
agencies have been releasing their high-value data for 
innovative reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC 
BY) licence. By June 2012, 75% of all government departments 
had already released their data, and the majority had plans to 
do so in the future. 

And yet, as the open government folks like to say, you're 
only as good as your last reuse. This is why Creative Commons 
licences are so important: they allow members of the public 
to share, remix and reuse public data, without having to ask 
permission in advance. Going by download figures from 
platforms like Koordinates, more people are viewing and 
downloading publicly funded data. But what about reuse? 

There are a few great examples coming to light, such as 
the ANZ truckometer. Using traffic volume data released by 
the New Zealand Transport Agency Waka Kotahi (NZTA), 
"ANZ selected key routes and applied statistical techniques 
to smooth out anomalies and gaps. The result is a strong 
correlation between traffic flows and predicting economic 
growth or decline as measured by GDP data from Statistics 
New Zealand. ANZ has found that, in general, light traffic 
flows give a six month heads-up on the direction the economy 
will take and heavy traffic flows give an even more accurate 
picture six months later". 1 



i www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/case-studies/open-data/anz-truckometer 




Another case study looked is the Charities Register, a 
tool released by the Charities Commission in June 2011. 
The Register offers information from over 25,000 registered 
charities for reuse under a Creative Commons Attribution 
licence. Since this initial release, the Register has been used by: 

• funding bodies like The Southern Trust; 

• government bodies like the Ministry for Social 
Development Te Manatu Whakahiato Ora and the 
Families Commission; 

• media organisations; 

• students and researchers; 

• local government bodies, like the Manawatu District 
Council; and 

• volunteer portals, such as that under construction by 
Student Job Search. 

More recently, the Open Government Data and Information 
Programme published the following case study on Dumpark: 
"When the Human Rights Commission wanted to track equality 
at work and provide an evidential basis for monitoring fairness 
in the workplace, it was no easy task. Instead of a manual and 
time-consuming process, they engaged Dumpark to access 
open data, open up other data, and build a web-based tool. 

'"Tracking Equality at Work' brings together a suite of 
employment data so that fairness and equality of outcomes at 
work can be compared. Dumpark helped the Human Rights 
Commission organise and open up relevant data to supply the 
tool. Further indicators and datasets will be added over time. 




"The disaggregated data uses four key aspects of work and 
the interactive tool allows analysis of equality by sex, ethnicity, 
age, disability, and over time. The web-tool makes it possible 
to track the persistence of inequality over time, and whether 
or not progress towards equality is being made. It also makes 
it possible to track the outcomes of a particular group across 
multiple indicators. The tool can also be used to disaggregate 
groups across several demographic characteristics. 

"Since Dumpark opened their doors in 2012, their 
primary goal has been to provide tools that allow people 
and organisations to understand and communicate data and 
complex information. 

"Co-founder Timo Franz says 'Our primary focus has been 
on opening up data and creating data visualisation tools as a 
public service. We believe governments represent the citizens 
of the world, and data can be used to drive transparency and 
accountability, as well as inform the democracy we live in.'" 

These are, of course, just a couple of examples of how 
government data is being released and reused - there are 
many, many more. Some of these are up at Open Data Stories.

and Information Programme website www.ict.govt.nz to

New Zealand Electronic Text 
Collection 



The New Zealand Electronic Text Collection (NZETC), a free 
online archive of New Zealand and Pacific Islands texts and 
heritage materials, was created in 2002 as part of the University 
of Victoria Library Te Pataka Korero. Since then, its accessible 
collection has grown to over 2,600 texts that feature in an 
online library. 

Their four main objectives are: 

• to create a digital library providing open access to 
significant New Zealand and Pacific Island texts and 
materials, encompassing both digitised heritage material 
and born-digital resources 

• to effectively partner with other organisations, as 
a collaborator and service provider, on a variety of 
digitisation and digital content projects 

• to build a wider community skilled in the use and 
creation of digital materials through teaching and 
training activities and by publishing and presenting the 
results of research, and 

• to work at the intersection of computing tools with 
textual material and investigate how these tools may 
be used to make new knowledge from our cultural 
inheritance. 

The NZETC works with many partners in the cultural 
heritage and ePublishing sector, such as National Library of 
New Zealand Te Puna Matauranga o Aotearoa, the Alexander 




Turnbull Library, the Auckland War Memorial Museum Tamaki 
Paenga Hira, and the State Library of Victoria. Projects have 
also been developed within Victoria University of Wellington 
Te Whare Wananga o te Upoko o te Ika a Maui with the 
International Institute of Modem Letters Te Putahi Tuhi Auaha 
o te Ao; the School of English, Film, Theatre and Media Studies 
Te Kura Tanga Korero Ingarihi, Kiriata, Whakaari, Papaho; 
Va'aoman Pasifika; the School of Biological Sciences Te Kura 
Matauranga Koiora; Victoria University Press; J C Beaglehole 
Room; and Wai-te-ata Press. The NZETC is an active member 
of the National Digital Forum, the Text Encoding Initiative 
Consortium, and the Australia and New Zealand Digital 
Encyclopaedia Group. 

The NZETC provides free access to a range of materials in 
multiple formats for download or online browsing. In situations 
where the original text is out of copyright, the NZETC provides 
a digitised version under a New Zealand Creative Commons 
Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) licence. This allows the 
sharing and remixing of the digitised text, even for commercial 
reasons, as long as the NZETC is credited and users license 
their new creations under the Creative Commons Attribution- 
ShareAlike Licence too. 

“We hope this will encourage more use of the resources by 
making it obvious to our users that, in many cases, they can 
take the digital editions to share and transform as they like," 
says Alison Stevenson, NZETC director. 

So far there are 433 titles available under the New Zealand 
Creative Commons licence, including Walter Buller's A History 



of the Birds of New Zealand, the 1914 edition of the Edmond's 
Cookery Book, Katherine Mansfield's fiction, Elsdon Best's 
monographs, and the many 19th-century New Zealand novels 
in the archive. 

Much of the material handled by the NZETC cannot 
be released with Creative Commons licences because full 
copyright is retained by others, although these parties will 
have the option of choosing Creative Commons for their work 
from now on. Alison says, "In terms of Creative Commons 
licensing for original works which are in copyright, now that 
we can demonstrate the licence in use on the site it will be 
easier to offer it as an option and we'll certainly talk to authors 
about this in future projects." The centre regularly received 
requests from remix poets for permission to republish text, and 
from journalists and exhibition organisers for permission to 
reproduce NZETC images. By applying a Creative Commons 
licence to some of the collection, users no longer have to contact 
the centre for permission on this material. 




LINZ Bata Service 



In June 2011, Land Information New Zealand Toitu Te Whenua 
(LINZ) launched the LINZ Data Service (LDS), a web-based 
tool that allows users to map and download LINZ data. LDS 
licenses most of its data under a Creative Commons Attribution 
(CC BY) licence. 

LDS was born, Manager Jeremy Palmer says, out of 
the need to do two things: "First, to drive innovation in the 
private sector to get better reuse of our data, and second, to 
drive efficiencies within government agencies." One of the 
operation's key requirements, Jeremy says, was the open 
licensing of data. 

Thanks to the New Zealand Government Open Access 
and Licensing (NZGOAL) framework, deciding to license 
with Creative Commons was a relatively simple process. "We 
brought NZGOAL into the equation early on, which allowed 
us to analyse our methods of licensing - previously, each 
dataset had its own terms, conditions and restrictions based 
on various levels of complex copyright. 

"We concluded pretty quickly that we could relicense most 
of our datasets under Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) 
licences - bar a few which have legal restrictions on them." 

Vicki Lindsay, Support Advisor, described the LDS 
experience as a "bit of a test pilot" for the implementation of 
the NZGOAL framework. "It was really good for us because 
we didn't need to develop any licences, but could adopt a 
licence recognised both nationally and internationally." 



LINZ's Chief Executive at the time, Colin MacDonald, was 
intimately involved in the cross-government programme for 
data and information re-use. The adoption of the NZGOAL 
framework was a strategic decision on LINZ's part - an 
opportunity for LINZ to show leadership in tire open data 
space. Jeremy says that stakeholders and partners that 
contributed to the design of the service would also chip in with 
advice: "We were working in partnership with Koordinates, 
who provided the technology for LDS and who are heavily 
involved in the open data movement." 

Before the launch of the LDS, access to LINZ datasets was 
primarily done through manual requests and provided on 
DVDs - a labour-intensive and time-consuming process. While 
some of these "legacy services" are rumring alongside the LDS 
currently, Vicki notes they will be streamlined into the LDS in 
the long term. As with any major change in service delivery, 
the transition can take time to negotiate. 

But Jeremy says the change has been for the best: "The 
service is a professional service, enabling easy online access 
to our data via a sophisticated set of tools and functionality. 
In a typical week, LDS gets upwards of 500 file downloads of 
our datasets - which is much, much more than when our data 
distribution was manually administered." 

Not only has opening the datasets increased usage in 
numbers, it's also invited a more diverse user-base, says Vicki. 
"Because it's much more accessible now, and free to access, 
we are seeing our customer base grow to include smaller 
organisations that may not have used LINZ data before. 



whereas customers who used our previous services were 
generally professional organisations who could consume that 
complex data quite easily. 

“It was generally very complex, so it was quite a shift in 
philosophy for us to go from being a raw bulk data distributor 
to taking that data and making it accessible to that wider range 
of users," adds Jeremy. 

Landscape architect Nigel Cowburn, of Growplan Ltd, 
uses the LDS datasets to arrive at worksites to meet clients 
“fully armed" with information about the property and 
landscape as it currently exists. He says the LDS enables him to 
prepare ahead of time. “It's free and reliable, and helps me ask 
intelligent questions," Nigel says. "It makes the remote part of 
my work possible, as I have a good idea of the landscape before 
I go - the more information I can access online, the better." 

LDS is frequently updated to meet the needs of its 
customers. But as with any large operation, the project didn't 
come without its obstacles. “The release and simplification of 
large datasets were a big challenge for us to manage - from 
the outset, however, by partnering with Koordinates, they had 
already solved some of the issues." 

Jeremy notes that the service is really showing results. 
The number of registered users of the LINZ Data Service 
continues to climb by several hundred users every month. 
These customers, spanning government, geospatial, survey, 
utility, contracting, and engineering sectors and beyond, are 
using the LINZ Data Service to realise efficiencies, innovation 
and improved decision-making. 



The LDS's efforts haven't gone unrecognised. LINZ was the 
recipient of the JK Barrie Award for Overall Excellence at the 
Asia Pacific Spatial Excellence Awards - the premier forum for 
recognising the spatial information industry's top performers. 
Of the award, LINZ Chief Executive Peter Mersi says, "It is 
recognition of tire highest order of the value of developing and 
implementing an easy-to-use geospatial data sharing service." 
Mersi says LDS has played a part in "revolutionising the way 
people can discover, use and share New Zealand public data". 

Jeremy notes that Australians are "envious of the openness 
of the whole ecosystem" that LDS uses. "In Australia, the 
multiple levels of government have imposed a model where 
they're trying to still do cost recovery for their assets. The fact 
that we were able to remove barriers with Creative Commons 
licences really made an impact and helped us win that award. 
Over there, a lot of their data is still very locked up." 

Quizzed about their advice to other government agencies 
considering using open licensing, both Jeremy and Vicki are 
supportive of the measures. "I'd definitely recommend opening 
access to public, non-private information across government. If 
there's a mandate to adopt open licensing, and you want to get 
it done, NZGOAL and Creative Commons licences get really 
good results and can reduce timeframes to actually just get the 
data out there." 




Statistics New Zealand 



On his blog Econometrics Beat Canadian economist David E 
Giles describes the open presentation of Statistics New Zealand 
(SNZ) Tatauranga Aotearoa's data online: "This isn't just a 
collection of boring spreadsheets. It's a valuable and serious 
piece of data research." 

He's right: SNZ have been pioneers in maximising 
transparency through the open licensing of many of their 
datasets, which they release online through web-based 
applications NZ.Stat and Infoshare. While SNZ is best known 
to the public for their management of the census, their remit 
stretches beyond just this - and they use open licences on 
much of their data to ensure it has maximum reach. 

The logic for SNZ is simple. Releasing data in an open 
framework helps for a range of reasons: 

• it makes it easier for government agencies to work 
together; 

• it reduces the cost of providing an existing government 
service, with decreased paperwork and hoops to jump 
through; 

• it maximises access and visibility to users, attracting new 
customers; and 

• it reduces the cost of accessing and processing 
information for existing users. 

Census data is what most of the public know SNZ for. 
Through their website, SNZ has released blocks of census 
data from 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2013 under Creative Commons 




Attribution (CC BY) licences. These datasets - which include 
information on age, ethnicity, income, workplace, dwelling 
size and geography - can be organised online and then 
downloaded in a variety of formats for remix and reuse. 

A dedicated team works to develop census datasets for 
phased release. They are constantly looking for ways to 
improve: for each new census recorded, changes and improve- 
ments in the range of datasets available are made based on 
user feedback. 

SNZ also releases economic datasets, which detail 
New Zealand's gross domestic product, consumer price index, 
balance of payments and productivity - all on a quarterly basis. 
This data is freely available for public and business through 
web-based tools that aid in the preparation and formatting of 
datasets for open use. 

Opening economic indicator data has been a great step 
for SNZ's visibility and usefulness to Aotearoa. Businesses, 
government agencies, community organisations and research 
institutions use the data to direct their research and develop- 
ment and to inform their decision-making at all levels - making 
New Zealand a more savvy, better-informed, and ultimately 
more prosperous place to live. 

These Tier 1 statistics, released online through SNZ's 
web-based applications, describe New Zealand's economy, 
environment, population, society, culture, international rela- 
tions, and civil and political rights. Government, businesses and 
members of the public use these statistics to make informed 
decisions and monitor the state and progress of Aotearoa. 



So, what makes them Tier 1? They are consistent, of high 
quality, and have integrity. This is why they are the priority 
for the government's statistical production. Tier 1 statistics 
are optimal for public, wide use, which is why it's important 
that they are published in a way that allows for equal and 
open access. Like the other data services, Tier 1 statistics 
are delivered through a broad range of formats, including 
in reports, as aggregate data and (with some restrictions) as 
microdata. 

In order to actually get data from their systems into 
customers' hands, SNZ uses its online data tools Infoshare 
and NZ.Stat, which were implemented through the Making 
Information Freely Available programme in 2008-09. Infoshare, 
designed in consultation with users to facilitate open databases, 
was the successor to INFOS, a closed subscription system that 
had only 90 consistent subscribers. 

SNZ's decision to open up its data through web-based data 
retrieval applications has seen user numbers increase from just 
90 to over 100,000 in 2011-12. Not only are these web-based 
applications user-friendly, they allow customers to organise 
data to suit them - presenting information in different formats 
to meet the needs of a diversity of users. 




Ministry for the Environment 



In July 2009 the Ministry for the Environment Manatu Mo 
Te Taiao started to release its datasets under a Creative 
Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence, becoming one of the 
first New Zealand government agencies to do so. 

The process started in 2007, when the Ministry found itself 
with a range of expiring licence agreements for the distribution 
of some of their datasets. These databases were distributed and 
managed by a third party, who would charge a fee, register 
users, then get people to sign a licence agreement before 
receiving the data. It was, in the words of Karl Majorhazi, 
Geographic Information Systems Professional Asia Pacific 
(GISP-AP) Senior Analyst, simply “the way things were done". 

“But it's not what we wanted," Karl explains, "because 
when you invest in a database, the value of that is related to 
the number of users and uses it's put to. So in the five years 
that that distribution agreement had been running, there were 
99 registered users. And when you are looking to fund an 
update and you've only got 99 users it doesn't make the maths 
look good." 

At this time, the State Services Commission (SSC) was 
beginning to look into the use of Creative Commons licences. 
Karl sat in on SSC meeting with Creative Commons Australia 
Project Lead Anne Fitzgerald, of the Queensland University of 
Technology Faculty of Law. 

Following this meeting, the decision to move to Creative 
Commons licensing was rather straightforward. "We tested it 



out, got some advice on what it is, what it could be used for, 
what it couldn't, and eventually we came to the decision that 
this was the way to go." 

The second piece of the puzzle was an online data platform 
Koordinates, launched only a few months earlier, which 
provided an easy way to search, sort and share the datasets. 

The Ministry's first release was on 1 July 2009, and it didn't 
take long for the data to be used in unexpected ways. 

"We had a request from a company in Germany who were 
making a flight simulator app for the iPhone, who wanted to 
know if they could use the Landcover database in their system 
to give a more feature-rich environment for anyone that's 
flying over the country." Of course, they didn't need to ask us, 
unlike as with past arrangements, because "the licence terms 
and conditions mean there's no reason why they can't". 

The Landcover database quickly went from 99 registered 
users to over 2,000 downloads, as researchers, students and 
members of the public began to freely use the data. 

Karl had a phone call from someone "who was looking 
at the watershed data that we provide as part of the Marine 
Environment Classification. He was using that for a search and 
rescue project, using the watersheds to determine where people 
get lost and found. That's one of these unintended reuses that 
you don't plan for when you are developing this database." 

Karl notes that one of the downsides of open data platforms 
is that you are unable to track users. Nevertheless, there have 
been several other exciting examples of high-value reuse of 
Ministry for the Environment data. 



As Karl explains, “I turned up at a seminar and a colleague 
of mine came bounding over from the other side of the room 
with a big smile on his face and said, 'I've got a good news 
story for you!' He operates a small consultancy and he was 
asked to turn around a quick analysis for parliament on how 
much it would roughly cost to dig trenches alongside roads 
and motorways to lay broadband cable. 

“He couldn't get access to the soil information from 
Land care at the time because it was under wraps commercially, 
but he found a piece of research that tied to it the attributes in 
the Land Environment dataset. He managed to download that 
dataset, use it in his analysis and turn that job around. 

“That is a case where people could do the job they needed 
to do because the data was already there - it's an argument for 
being proactive, not waiting until somebody requests it." 




Flgure.NZ 



Figure. NZ (formerly Wiki New Zealand) wants New 
Zealanders to make informed decisions. To this end, Lillian 
Grace, Founder of Figure. NZ, and others have uploaded 
graphs and thematic maps based on public data to Figure. NZ, 
a collaborative website. 

While some of the data is used with permission, all of the 
content by Figure. NZ itself is made available under a Creative 
Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence. 

Lillian had the idea for Figure. NZ in February 2012 while 
working for the New Zealand Institute. While giving talks 
to community and business groups, Lillian realised, “Every 
single issue that we addressed would have been easier to deal 
with if more people understood the basic facts. 

“That's one of the driving forces for me behind Figure. NZ. 
I'm concerned for New Zealand's future and I think that the 
best chance we have of getting the best outcomes is if more 
people are informed and can make informed decisions. 

"I've seen the power of informed decisions. I've seen the 
light go on in people when they learn something that they 
didn't know." 

To help more New Zealanders find out about their country, 
Lillian decided to apply a Creative Commons Attribution (CC 
BY) licence to all Figure. NZ content. This licence allows users 
to share and adapt Figure. NZ content, as long as they provide 
attribution. 




As Lillian puts it, "Creative Commons seemed like a 
natural fit because it seems like its purposes are very aligned 
with ours. I never actually considered not using it. 

"I really believe in sharing data and information. I like 
Creative Commons. Part of it is the language that it uses. 
It seems like its purpose is very clear. It's a very sensible 
structure. It's not scary to use. I felt very safe and responsible, 
like I was doing the right thing. This is very important when it 
comes to copyright, which can be quite daunting." 

Figure.NZ has licensing statements for each graph, to 
ensure that users know exactly what they can do with its 
source data. While most content is sourced from New Zealand 
government agencies using Creative Commons licences, some 
of the content is made available under a more restrictive 
licensing agreement. "Some of the sources are fully open, like 
Statistics New Zealand, but some sources only let their data be 
reproduced for free if it's not for commercial use. 

"Imagine a scientist in the South Island collecting bacteria 
samples in fresh water - that's great information. I'd be interested 
in knowing about that. But there has not been any mechanism to 
easily and regularly share such data with the public. Figure.NZ 
enables them to submit their data in an online visual form that 
can be viewed and valued by tire rest of the country. 

"The process is audited for content accuracy and 
impartiality, and the graphs are dynamically generated with 
a consistent look and feel to make them as easy as possible to 
make and digest." 




Lillian is hoping for a wide range of innovative reuse. 
"Anyone can do anything with the information Figure.NZ 
provides, as long as they abide by the licensing of the original 
sources. We're providing our graphs in a range of different 
formats. Journalists can download the graphs and add their 
own branding, as long as they attribute the sources and Figure. 
NZ. They can repackage it how they like." 

To help promote the site, Lillian has introduced a 'Know 
Your Country' feature, which tests users' knowledge about 
New Zealand. 

While the site will be extremely useful for teachers 
and journalists, Lillian hopes that it will appeal to all New 
Zealanders. "It's hard to pinpoint specific users, as it really is 
for everyone. 

"I want it to infiltrate the culture, to make it cool to know 
your country, to make it normal to know your country." 




GNS Science and GeoNet 



In March 2001, GNS Science Te Pu Ao, in partnership with the 
Earthquake Commission (EQC), launched GeoNet, a website 
providing real-time information on a range of geological 
hazards, including tsunami, volcanic activity and earthquakes. 
Since 2009, all GeoNet's data has been made available under a 
Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence. 

The idea for GeoNet came in the mid-1990s, as GNS started 
a process to get funding to re-establish the old scientific 
monitoring system. Several years into the process, EQC 
suggested a partnership. 

As Ken Gledhill, who manages the GeoNet project, points 
out, EQC realised the intrinsic benefits of opening up public 
earthquake data. In discussions with GNS, EQC insisted that all 
aspects of the data be made publicly available. "The idea was 
that the data would be available to all who wanted it, and that 
wouldn't just be restricted to New Zealand. It was international. 
It was intended to increase research and then lead to better 
knowledge of our geological hazards." 

At this early stage, EQC and GNS agreed on a user licence 
that was similar in principle to what would become, several 
years later, Creative Commons. As Ken puts it, "The essence 
of Creative Commons was already there. The reasons EQC 
got involved were the same reasons that underpin Creative 
Commons today: if you hoard it, nothing happens. If you get it 
out there, there are all sorts of benefits." 




Peter Barker, General Counsel for GNS, agrees: "EQC 
showed a lot of foresight in going in that direction." 

In 2009, the GeoNet contract between GNS and EQC was 
renewed, and at that stage it was decided to apply a Creative 
Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence to the data. "It was a 
convenient means of doing what we were already doing, and 
was consistent with government policy. "The whole intent of 
the contract between GNS and EQC for GeoNet was public 
good. It wasn't about any particular financial benefit to an 
organisation." 

Peter points out that the cost of producing data and the need 
for GNS to operate as a business will continue to complicate 
the drive to make all scientific data accessible at no cost. 

"We don't believe in hoarding the data, for any reason. We 
believe in the economic benefit to the country of having the 
data available and this is how science works. At the same time, 
in a significant area that we work, the collection of data is quite 
expensive. We need to see what's under the earth or seabed. 
Drilling, for example, is very expensive, so the financial 
ramifications have to be considered. 

"Also, the Crown Research Institutes Act requires that we 
run a viable business and profit is the way we pay for salary 
increases and scientific equipment. Our model is therefore to 
make data freely available but sometimes not for free. The cost 
will reflect our expenses and should not be a barrier to access." 

Ken adds that it is much easier for a consortium of 
organisations to open up for free data produced by high-cost, 
capital-intensive public good projects like GeoNet, where the 



costs incurred by GNS are covered. An ongoing example of this 
kind of collaboration is the effort by GNS and LINZ to measure 
the gravitational field for science and survey purposes. The 
raw data they produce from this project is made available 
under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence. 

For other projects, including some involving an inventory 
of extremophile biological material, GNS have used more 
restrictive Creative Commons licences. GNS has also licensed 
a number of the databases on its website under a Creative 
Commons Attribution- ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) licence. 

Peter explains that the organisation wanted to use 
ShareAlike in order to "perpetuate the concept of Creative 
Commons. A lot of the scientists here are very supportive, 
as they use open source material in their own research. They 
believe in it." 

GeoNet remains their most successful example of open 
data. The GeoNet site receives up to 16,000 visitors a second. 
There have also been many examples of innovative reuse of 
GeoNet data. Ken remembers in particular in the aftermath of 
the Canterbury earthquakes: "A lot of what we saw in those 
first few months was people grabbing the data we were making 
available and presenting it in completely new ways. We didn't 
like all of it, but that's tough. Some people did some neat 
animations, others did 3D imaging. It was really very good. 

"There are bright people out there, and if you make it 
discoverable, they grab onto it really quickly." 




Open Licensing and the Christchurch 
Earthquake 

This case study is reproduced from a 2011 post on the Open 
Data Stories website. 

The New Zealand Government's need for imagery, film 
footage and data after tire recent Christchurch earthquake to 
help in the various relief efforts and the need for it to be freely 
available for reuse by individuals and organisations alike has 
brought the utility of the New Zealand Government Open 
Access and Licensing framework (NZGOAL) and Creative 
Commons licensing into sharp focus. In "Post-quake imagery 
of Christchurch carries Creative Commons licence", Creative 
Commons Aotearoa New Zealand published a timely piece that 
showcases some of the initiatives across government to apply 
NZGOAL and licence material for reuse using open Creative 
Commons licences, such as aerial photography published by 
Koordinates and footage from Civil Defence. 

Those assisting with such government initiatives have 
learned a couple of things from the experience. On the one 
hand, some agencies and officials within agencies are well 
aware of NZGOAL and are both willing and able to apply 
it to enable the legal re-use of government owned copyright 
material. On the other hand, other agencies and officials have 
limited awareness of it. That is no criticism. It's simply a 
statement of fact. 

What was most illuminating, in one case involving film 
footage of the post-earthquake CBD, was that a request to assist 



with licensing of certain material assumed (understandably) 
that there might be legal documents to draft and sign as a 
prerequisite to releasing the material for reuse. The official 
concerned wasn't familiar with the detail of NZGOAL but, once 
explained, he was most interested. He was after a quick and 
efficient solution to enable the licensing of valuable material, 
with tire express purpose of enabling others to reuse it in a 
hassle-free way, and was pleased to learn that we could rapidly 
apply a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence to it, 
and without requiring prospective users of the material to sign a 
single document. Using NZGOAL's review and release process, 
we were able to undertake tire requisite legal analysis quickly 
and provide him with rapid turn-around of the copyright and 
licensing statements he needed to apply to tire material. From 
start to finish, the whole process took little more than an hour. 
Shortly thereafter we saw the material springing up on multiple 
websites around the country. 

The purpose of this story, then, is that it shows that open 
data - in this case open licensing of film footage - was helpful 
for both the agency concerned and those who wished to re-use 
the film footage for their own purposes (whether they were 
the media or otherwise). Can we put a monetary figure on this 
particular example of open data and open licensing? Not really, 
no. Was it in the public interest in the wake of a major disaster 
to make this film footage freely available? It certainly was. 




Koordinates 



Koordinates is a New Zealand-based company that provides 
clever platforms for hosting and viewing geographic datasets. 
Map layers are visualised online and can be downloaded as 
professional data in a way that has been described as “Google 
Earth for professionals". Koordinates often relies on, and indeed 
encourages, providers of its geographic datasets to be published 
under a Creative Commons licence to streamline reuse. 

Koordinates currently provides datasets about all kinds of 
things, from feral goat distribution to Wellington windy zones, 
all sourced from outside parties like Government departments 
and independent business listing services. 

The Koordinates website offers the information as 
"layers" which users can visually layer together over a map 
as they choose. "When you add a map layer, the actual data 
is converted into a simple Google Maps view and displayed 
in your web browser," says Ed Corkery, co-founder and CEO 
of Koordinates. 

A piece of information that can be associated with a 
geographic location comes alive when working with maps. 
Property buyers, for example, can pull together layers 
displaying high-resolution aerial photos, building footprints, 
street locations, kerbs, school zone boundaries, parks and 
electoral ward boundaries to learn more about the context of 
their future house. 

The sorts of datasets it would be useful to see layered on a 
map are often collated and updated by Government agencies 



and are subject to crown copyright. Although some datasets are 
of a commercial nature and retain an "all rights reserved" status, 
most are provided for public reuse via Koordinates under the 
Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence. New Zealand 
councils and Government agencies are embracing Creative 
Commons for their datasets on Koordinates as encouraged 
by the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing 
framework and its strong endorsement of the CC BY licence 
for non-personal copyright materials. 

But it's not just policy that is driving early uptake of Creative 
Commons licences in this area. Koordinates has actively 
encouraged its providers to consider open access as part of their 
publishing practices. 

According to Ed, a "lack of clearly understood licences 
is a big road-block to reuse of public data. We recommend 
the Creative Commons licensing system as an easy way for 
councils and Government agencies to avoid that roadblock by 
using an off-the-shelf licence system reaching critical mass." 

If we're given enough layers and enough access, the uses 
for this platform are endless. 

It's not just hobbyists or researchers who can benefit from 
this knowledge - industry and professional practitioners 
gain value from readily available geographic datasets too. 
Upfront information about a location's soil content, for 
example, can streamline planning and decision making 
processes for farmers, builders and civil engineers. 

While Koordinates can host and make such information 
available as layers, it is providing commercial opportunities 



for third-party application developers to package up certain 
information in user-friendly ways for many different types of 
people. 

"A developer can combine datasets from Koordinates and 
turn them into more useful services, such as iPhone apps," 
says Ed. 

It's foreseeable that a Government agency's initial decision 
to release geographic data under permissible licences is not 
only benefiting nonprofit activities, but is also stimulating 
healthy new business opportunities. 

The datasets themselves need to be freed up from technical 
and copyright restrictions so that people can fully utilise 
the resources with fewer administrative burdens slowing it 
all down. Off-the-shelf copyright licences, such as Creative 
Commons, solve this problem. 




New Zealand Transport Agency 

The New Zealand Transport Agency Waka Kotahi (NZTA) is 
one of New Zealand's largest producers of spatial data. Since 
August 2012, the organisation has been uploading its aerial 
imagery to Koordinates, a platform for geospatial datasets, 
under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence. 

The spatial team has been considering how to open its data 
since the release of the New Zealand Government Open Access 
and Licensing (NZGOAL) framework, approved by Cabinet in 
July 2010. According to Geospatial Specialist Chris Worts, "We 
realised that this is something we should be doing more. There 
was nothing stopping us." 

NZTA produces a range of datasets, many of which were 
available on request. For members of the public, though, this 
wasn't necessarily obvious, nor was the process of disseminating 
the data straightforward. 

When NZTA received a request, someone in the spatial 
team - often Chris himself - would have to manually extract 
the data. "It would be a case of emailing data or copying the 
data onto hard drives and sending it out, which can be labour 
intensive." 

With hosting platforms like Koordinates - coupled with 
free open licences like Creative Commons - it has become 
much easier for the public to find and reuse publicly funded 
datasets. Koordinates provides an ideal platform for NZTA to 
start releasing their own spatial data, as it is both popular and 
easy to use. 



Before uploading the datasets to Koordinates, Chris had 
received only a handful of enquiries. Since then, the datasets 
have received tens of thousands of views and several thousand 
downloads - an exponential rise in the reuse of NZTA's datasets. 

Their experience supports a 2009 report from Land 
Information New Zealand. As the report concludes, the financial 
benefit of opening publicly funded spatial data is enormous: 

“Had key barriers [to the reuse of publicly funded spatial 
data] been removed, it is estimated that New Zealand could 
have benefitted from an additional $481 million in productivity- 
related benefits in 2008, generating at least $100 million in 
government revenue." 

While it's hard to argue with such a conclusion, the process 
of actually releasing the datasets can be quite complex. Not all 
datasets produced by NZTA are suitable for public reuse. 

Some datasets, for example, might not be accurate in two or 
three years' - or even two or three days' - time; also, many are 
designed for a specific use, and are therefore not suitable for 
wide release. For this reason, Chris highlights the importance of 
“providing accurate metadata, so that users know the limitations 
of a dataset and how, when and why the data was created". 

While the spatial team has no concrete plans to release 
more datasets, Chris says that the team will continue to release 
datasets as appropriate in the future. 

Other areas of NZTA have also started to embrace 
Creative Commons licensing. Like many public agencies, 
NZTA produces an enormous range of content, including 
advertisements, reports, videos and images. NZTA's Education 



Team ran a successful remix competition. The winners included 
Tawa College's Drink Driving Website and Darfield High 
School's "Shakespearean Warrant of Fitness" Advertisement. 

"It is something different that's rumring through your 
mind now, it's not just, what can I use it for? Instead we ask, 
what are the potential wider benefits?" 




Open 

Education 




Open Education 

By Matt McGregor, Public Lead, Creative Commons Aotearoa 
New Zealand 

Max Riley is a maths teacher at Nayland College in Nelson 
whose departmental website, Nayland Mathematics, provides 
high-quality resources that are reused by teachers all over 
the country. As of August 2015, the website has received over 
two million hits - a truly extraordinary number for a school 
department's homepage. 

It's worth pausing to consider the amount of time and energy 
that Max's website has saved maths teachers across Aotearoa. 
The teachers using the resources on Nayland Mathematics - 
unlike many of their colleagues in other subjects - no longer 
need to reinvent the wheel. They can, instead, spend their 
time adapting Max's resources to meet the needs of their own 
students. 

There is, of course, only one Max Riley. But there are many 
thousands of New Zealand educators who have spent their 
careers developing a range of high-quality resources. And 
there are many more thousands of teachers who would benefit 
from being able to easily find, use and adapt these resources, 
without having to worry about legal or technical restrictions. 
With over 100,000 teachers in the compulsory education sector, 
the potential savings in time and energy are enormous. 

This is why so many New Zealand educators are starting 
to make and use Open Educational Resources (OERs). OERs 
are resources that have been made available free of technical. 




price, and most legal restrictions on reuse, for the benefit of 
every teacher in New Zealand (and the world). By removing 
the barriers to accessing educational resources, we can allow 
Kiwi teachers more time to do their jobs, and less time building 
resources from scratch. 

The Price of Education 

OERs aren't only good for teachers. In the tertiary education 
sector, we're seeing an enormous, prolonged increase in the cost 
of textbooks. While we don't have figures for New Zealand, 
those coming from the United States beggar belief. According 
to the US Bureau of Statistics, the cost of textbooks has risen 
1,500% since 1970 - that's three times the rate of inflation. The 
cost of textbooks has risen faster than medical services and 
property prices (even in Auckland). 

Asa result The New Zealand Union of Students' Associations 
has found itself lobbying for an increase in the borrowing limit 
for course-related costs. And with textbook prices as high as 
they are, it's not hard to see why. Take, for example, a common 
undergraduate economics textbook. Principles of Economics: 
Australia and New Zealand Edition (sixth edition) by N Gregory 
Mankiw et al. According to the publisher's website, this book 
goes for AU$152.95. 1 The equivalent for psychology students, 
Psychology (8th edition) by Gleitman et al., has a list price of 
NZ$179.99. 

Tertiary Education Institutions - and schools - also 
pay a large amount for the right to copy closed educational 



i https://cengage.co.nz/product/division/university/title/principles-of-economics-australia- 
and-new-zea/isbn/9780170248532 



resources beyond the very limited rights granted under the 
1994 Copyright Act. While these fees are often justified in 
terms of supporting independent creators, they also go to 
textbook publishers (and the publishers of academic research). 
With greater use of open resources, and greater Open Access 
mandates, institutions (and their students) could pay less in 
copyright licensing fees. 

It's not just a problem of cost. Textbooks are also notoriously 
closed - that is, they are unable to be legally copied or 
revised. Because New Zealand is a small country, many of 
our textbooks are written and published overseas but cannot 
be legally adapted by Kiwi educators for our own students 
(without paying expensive licensing fees to tire publisher). 

The solution to this problem is twofold. Firstly, we need 
more educators and departments actively choosing to use 
OERs for their courses and moving away from the closed and 
(remarkably) expensive alternatives. Over the last decade, we 
have seen the production of an increasingly large Commons 
of educational resources in almost every nation on the planet, 
ranging from small book-sprints to large funding projects, 
including President Obama's US$2 billion open education 
grant programme. 2 We need more New Zealand educators to 
assign these open textbooks instead of their closed, expensive 
alternatives. 

Secondly, change needs to come from those who set policy 
for the sector, which includes both the institutions themselves 

2 The Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training (TAACCCT) Grant 
Programme provides grants to community colleges to produce open educational resources for 
training courses in high-demand, high-wage industries. For more information, see: www.doleta.gov/ 
taaccct/ 



and central government agencies. These policy-makers need 
to ensure that all publicly funded educational resources are 
made open by default. In addition, they need to provide strong 
incentives to educators to adopt and reuse open textbooks that 
have already been produced. 

As the pieces in this chapter suggest, we are already seeing 
the first signs of movement. The Open Educational Resources 
universitas (OERu), based at Otago Polytechnic, is working with 
dozens of institutions in New Zealand and around the world on 
the development of courses using open educational resources. 
Some forward-thinking educators, like Erika Pearson, Tim Bell 
and all the folks who wrote Media Studies 101 and the Computer 
Science Unplugged textbooks, are producing high-quality local 
OERs. But these projects are still in the minority, and the 
New Zealand tertiary education sector is still lagging behind its 
international counterparts. As our student debt levels continue 
to rise, New Zealand students are paying the price. 

□pen Schools 

The move to OERs in schools is looking rosier. In fact, with 
the increasing availability of digital technologies and tire rise 
of centralised resource-sharing portals like Pond, tire Network 
for Learning portal, there's no longer any technical reason why 
every school in New Zealand can't replicate the success of 
Nayland Mathematics. 

But here's the rub: under New Zealand copyright law, 
employers have first ownership of copyright works produced 
in the course of a teacher's employment. This means that 



teachers who share copyright resources outside of the school 
are legally infringing their school's intellectual property - even 
resources they have themselves created. As more sharing takes 
place online, copyright will become harder and harder to ignore 
and is already causing teachers considerable uncertainty. No 
teacher, after all, wishes to break the law. 

To head off this uncertainty, schools have started to clearly 
adopt policies in favour of open educational resources. At the 
time of writing, over 100 New Zealand schools have adopted 
a Creative Commons policy, openly licensing their copyright 
works and thus enabling their teachers to legally share their 
resources for adaptation and reuse. These schools, including 
Taupaki School, Albany Senior High School and Hutt Valley 
High School, passed their policies to address some of the 
thorny legal and moral issues of sharing copyright works, and 
to ensure that all works produced by their teachers are added 
to the global Commons of OERs. 

A Creative Commons policy provides a clear statement of a 
school's position on copyright resources produced by teachers 
employed at the school. Simply put, the policy allows teachers 
to use Creative Commons licensing to share their work for 
reuse. It ensures that when teachers leave, both the teacher and 
the school retain access to all teaching resources. 

With Creative Commons licensing and great online sharing 
portals. New Zealand has the opportunity to ensure that all 
teachers, no matter the subject or year level, have access to the 
best resources produced by their colleagues in other schools 
around the country without having to worry about any 



technical or legal restrictions. As Max Riley puts it, "The more 
we share, the more resources there will be for all." 

Hungry for Knowledge 

This is not just a New Zealand issue. The global demand for 
education is skyrocketing, and OERs are the most efficient way 
to meet this demand. According to estimates from UNESCO, 
the world will need approximately 98 million extra places to 
meet growing demand from qualified students. As Stamenka 
Uvalic-Trumbic of UNESCO puts it, accommodating these 
students "would require more than four major universities 
(30,000 students) to open every week for the next 15 years". 3 

This is the aim of projects like the OERu, discussed later in 
this chapter: to find new, open ways to provide educational 
opportunities to anyone who wants them. As Wayne 
Mackintosh and the OERu team recognise, there's no longer 
any technical reason why anyone in the world with an internet 
connection shouldn't have access to education. And with 
Creative Commons, we have the legal tools to provide these 
resources free of legal and price restrictions on access, sharing 
and reuse. 

What we need are more of the projects outlined in this 
chapter: educators, librarians and institutions actively working 
to make, reuse and adopt open educational resources.

The Media Studies Text Hack 

By Richard White, Copyright and Open Access Manager, 

University of Otago Te Whare Wananga o Otago 

On the weekend of 16-17November 2013, a group of academics 
and librarians across Australia and New Zealand got together 
virtually to collaboratively write (or hack) an open textbook 
for the field of media studies. 

The team was inspired by a group of Finnish mathematicians 
who wrote an open mathematics textbook in a weekend, 
and the ideals of Open Educational Resources (OER): high- 
quality, free-to-access and free-to-reuse educational materials. 
Given the specific terrain of the discipline of media studies, 
alongside the small student populations, there is only a 
limited range of texts available for students of media to use, 
thus the area seemed ripe for a new approach, such as OER. 
The project is, as far as we know, the only hacked textbook 
where participants were so geographically dispersed and 
connected only virtually. 

An important part of the project has been to write up our 
experiences so that others can learn from our mistakes. We've 
developed a set of resources, which together form what we've 
called the Hackpack. This comprises a Cookbook (which 
describes how the project developed and was run, including 
the tech platforms we used), a sample MOU for participants, 
a project plan, reflections from the librarians involved, and 
notes on the process - what worked and what we might do 




differently next time. This information is provided to help 
others plan their own hacks. 

As is the way with open projects, it is the unintended 
consequences that are often the most interesting. Almost 
immediately upon release in February 2014, a message came 
from the folks at BCampus, who said they'd love to host the 
text on their site and they had a cool tool that could transform 
our Wordpress version into mobile-friendly formats. Some 
of the content and most of the Hackpack have also found a 
receptive audience at University of British Columbia. We've 
also seen, through stats from the Wordpress site, a good level 
of access from some schools in New Zealand, which is an 
unanticipated but most welcome form of engagement. Perhaps 
most gratifying was an email from an academic in the School 
of Journalism at Cape Peninsula University of Technology in 
South Africa, who was grateful that his students - many of 
whom struggle to buy textbooks - were able to use Media 
Studies 101. Indeed, leaving aside the heavy use from students 
at Otago, the text is being used all around the world, with 
people from more than 200 countries having at least visited 
the site (the main countries include: Australia, Canada, South 
Africa, the US and a variety of places in Eastern Europe) - and 
the text has been downloaded over 10,000 times! 

The media studies text is now the core resource for the 
Introduction to Communication Studies at the University of 
Otago Te Whare Wananga o Otago, as well as supplementary 
material for other first-year courses. Unsurprisingly the 
students love the fact that it's free - "serious levels of 




enthusiasm" says Erika Pearson, who runs the paper. And 
there's no such thing as students being disadvantaged by 
out-of-date editions anymore. Erika is doing some research 
on the effects of using an open text in her class, the results of 
which aren't in yet, but early data suggests that there has been 
interesting side effects here too. While it was really intended 
for first years, references are turning up in the bibliographies 
of more senior students, who have never been assigned the 
text but who have heard about it through word of mouth 
and use it to help refresh themselves on key concepts in the 
discipline. Another result that may lead to changes in future 
versions is the fact that students have been raised on a diet 
of highlighting-key-points-on-printed-documents: one of 
the most common questions from students is still "How do 
I print it?" 

Erika has been experimenting with the EdX Open Source 
learning management system (LMS) for this course and because 
the text is in an open format, she can embed the Wordpress 
textbook right inside the LMS. This means she can see which 
chapters get the heaviest use at which times; she can even see how 
long an individual student has spent on a page! 1:00 a.m. seems 
to be tire optimum time for her students to access the text and 
3:00 a.m. is not uncommon when an assignment is due. Given 
the aims of the project, one of the most encouraging outcomes 
has been a dramatic increase in local examples cited by students 
in assignments; previously they tended to come up with US- 
centric examples, since students tend to learn behaviours from 
their textbooks. Now, through the use of the open platforms. 



current, topical and local examples can be quickly shared with 
the entire cohort. 

The next step is to evaluate how the content is working 
in practice with real, live students. Then the plan is to run a 
second hack sometime in 2016 to improve the design, fill 
gaps in the content and increase the local content, such as 
developing some more content with a Pacific focus. The 
experiment in open resources and hacking has proven not 
only useful to students locally and globally, but also to the 
staff that took part - links have formed between academics, 
students, postgraduates, librarians and designers who might 
otherwise have never encountered each other. The Media Text 
Hack has become the seed of a wider community of scholars 
pursuing interests in more open models of research, teaching 
and scholarship. 




The Computer Science Held Guide 

By Tim Bell, Department of Computer Science and Software 
Engineering, University of Canterbury Te Whare Wananga o Waitaha 

Imagine as a high school teacher needing to teach a subject 
that you have barely heard of, has never been taught before 
in schools and it counts towards a student's graduating 
assessment! 

This happened to many teachers in 201 1, when New Zealand 
became one of the first countries in the English-speaking world 
to offer Computer Science as a formal topic in high school. As in 
many other countries, prior to this computing had been taught 
in a way that viewed students as users rather than developers. 
However, due to New Zealand being an early adopter, there 
were very few resources available for teachers, and those that 
were available were disparate, generally being pitched at a 
level that was too high (e.g. university courses) or too low (e.g. 
the CS Unplugged activities for primary school children). 

In response to this, the Computer Science Education 
Research Group at the University of Canterbury (also known 
as the 'Department of Fun Stuff') started work on the Computer 
Science Field Guide, an online 'textbook' to serve as a resource 
for high school students and a guide for teachers. The demand 
for the resource was so high that it was already getting heavy 
use while it was still being developed, to the point that we 
now just call it a 'beta' release, and are constantly working to 
improve it. 




The online book has been designed to be engaging and give 
a quirky approach to the topics, making good use of genuinely 
interactive activities to enable students to experience the 
concepts first-hand. It generally uses a constructivist approach, 
where we aim to lead students through experiences that 
enable them to construct concepts in their own minds, rather 
than us simply giving them information. We have developed 
short videos for the start of each chapter to raise some of the 
questions that the topic addresses, usually in a humorous 
way, and presented by a Computer Science student so that the 
material is authentic and approachable. 

Following in the footsteps of its sister site Computer 
Science Unplugged, which is intended for primary-aged 
students, the CS Field Guide does not require the students 
to do any programming. This is to prevent learning 
programming being a barrier for students to engage with the 
exciting and surprising ideas in Computer Science; in fact, for 
some students, finding out what Computer Science is will be 
a motivator to learn to program. 

The guide is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution- 
NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) licence, so users 
are welcome to take copies and modify them. The material is 
produced using the Open Source Sphinx system, which was 
originally designed for writing Python documentation, and 
works from plain-text source files using the reStructuredText 
format (although we are in tire process of changing to a 
more manageable format). The interactives are written using 
JavaScript and HTML5, and the videos are released on Vimeo 



so that teachers can download them. All of these components 
are released with the Creative Commons licence so that the 
entire book can be reconstructed independently. Many people 
have contributed to different parts of the guide with videos, 
interactive activities, images and ideas, although most of the 
writing has been done by just a few people, which has kept it 
more consistent and coherent. 

The guide is currently presented as a website, and the 
various components are carefully configured to work on as 
many systems as possible, especially bearing in mind that 
some schools operate using very old computer labs or old 
versions of software, while others may primarily use tablets, 
which places a lot of restrictions on the technologies that can 
be used effectively. Often if a teacher encounters something 
that won't work, they need to apply for new software to be 
installed, and even if it's approved it may take some time, so 
our goal is to put in as few barriers as possible. 

The system we're using can also generate pdf and ebook 
(epub and mobi) versions of the text. Teachers appreciate 
being able to print a copy (although this obviously loses the 
video and interactive components). The ebook versions are 
still under development as our priority has been to fill out the 
online web version first. 

There were several reasons for choosing to keep the 
resource as open as possible: 

• Open Source is natural for the Computer Science 
community. Programming languages tend to be open 
source, or at least available at no cost. From a teaching 



point of view, this means that students can use the 
resources on any computer and at home without 
restriction. Teachers and students come to expect 
Computer Science resources to be free, and any that 
aren't may be overlooked. The approach we're taking is 
modelled after (and in cooperation with) the Runestone 
Interactive project, which offers several interactive open- 
source Computer Science books. 

• We have limited resources (both time and money), and 
don't want the book to be limited by our capacity, yet we 
needed to get something out quickly. 

• It's important for the resource to be adaptable. 
New Zealand has been leading the world in Computer 
Science in high schools, and there is strong interest in our 
resources, so by making it open it can be readily adapted 
for overseas contexts where the curriculum may be similar 
but not exactly the same. This also makes translation 
simple - no special permission is required. 

• We can use other open resources as part of the guide; for 
example, some xkcd comics relate well to the topic, and 
can be used in this context. 

• Being open gives teachers security that the resource 
won't go away or date, since someone else can pick it up 
if we are unable to continue with it. 

Teachers have reported copying sections of the guide 
to their own local school pages, and making selected parts 
available to students to help them focus; being open gives the 




flexibility for them to customise it for their students, or simply 
use it as it is. 

Writing a school 'textbook' with shared authorship and 
open content creates a number of challenges. 

One of these is how to deal with 'secret' parts of the book. 
Many textbooks have a teachers' version that includes answers 
to questions. Teachers appreciate having these answers 
available so they can be sure they've got tilings right and then 
help stimulate discussion about the question. Openness brings 
the concern that a student might download the teacher version 
and subvert their own learning by simply reading off answers 
instead of thinking through the questions. Our approach has 
been that the teacher version contains a lot of material that 
teachers value but students would find uninteresting, and the 
hope is that students won't be interested in delving into it for the 
wrong reasons. In the end, students need to realise that the goal 
is for them to learn, rather than to look smart in class or annoy 
their teacher. 

The teacher version is generated from the same source file 
as the student version, which makes editing and consistency 
a lot easier than having two versions. The Sphinx system has 
commands for the conditional use of sections of text; this can 
be expanded in the future to accommodate other versions, 
perhaps for slightly different curricula or year levels. 

Another challenge is keeping the resource consistent. 
Authors have a remarkably wide variety of styles, and we 
have gone for a slightly quirky and constructivist style. 




Another author might see the constructivism as not giving all 
the information, and in an Open Source environment could 
come in and 'fill in the gaps', inadvertently undermining the 
pedagogy. Everyone has opinions on how education should be 
done, and if the material ends up being done 'by committee', 
then it's hard for it to be vibrant and have character. Also, the 
author needs to understand the audience (in this case, Kiwi 
teenagers and their teachers). 

To date, diverse authorship hasn't been a major problem, 
because all the writing has been done within a small close-knit 
group, but it's possible that other versions may fork from ours. 
Our hope is that if a new version is better it will flourish, and if 
not, it will have been a useful experiment. 

Translation of open books is also a challenge that we 
have yet to tackle properly. An Open Source textbook can be 
copied by others who want to add a fork in the content. If the 
original guide is changed, the copy becomes out of date. The 
same applies to translations of the guide, since each translation 
is also a new version, and later updates may need to be re- 
translated. This is a wide challenge in open publishing - for 
example, until recently, Wikipedia simply allowed different 
translations of articles to appear independently, so inevitably 
they would get out of sync. 

Another challenge is that the software behind a site needs 
to be open to make the content truly open. In our case, the 
main text processing is all done by open-source software, but 
there are elements (such as the video production) that use 
proprietary software. The sister site, CS Unplugged, has a 



similar issue, where currently the source of the main book is 
available in MS Word. The content is open, but users are forced 
to use proprietary software to edit the document. They could 
use OpenOffice, but the formatting gets badly messed up. Of 
course, the document is available as a pdf as well, but that can't 
be edited easily. Ultimately we may revert to a similar system 
to the field guide, a plain-text markup language as the source, 
and then many different formats generated from it. 

Developing an open source 'textbook' has many challenges, 
but the benefits of getting it to schools quickly and giving 
teachers confidence that they can have some control over the 
content (in principle at least) has been worthwhile. 




The Waikato Independent 

The Waikato Independent is an online newspaper produced by 
journalism students at the Waikato Institute of Technology 
(Wintec). All stories published on the site are made available 
under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial- 
NoDerivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND). 

The Waikato Independent is edited by Charles Riddle, 
Lecturer in the School of Media Arts. Charles explains, “We 
use the The Waikato Independent as a teaching tool. What we're 
really interested in is getting our students' work published as 
widely as possible. 

“We put their work up under an open Creative Commons 
licence so that any of the community newspapers or websites 
that like the work can feel free to republish it, as long as they 
acknowledge the student as the author. 

“The idea was that other media would pick it up, because 
the more widely a student can get published, the better it looks 
on their CV." 

Other media are paying attention. In February 2013, a 
story about a local talent show contestant, written by Caitlin 
Wallace, was picked up by Hamilton News Live; that story, in 
turn, was picked up by The New Zealand Herald, New Zealand's 
largest newspaper. “It can have that knock-on effect that we're 
not even always aware of." 

Another example of reuse was a story about a local 
Motocross rider, written by Corey Rosser, which was 
republished in SunLive. 



Faculty at Wintec's School of Media Arts have introduced 
Creative Commons licensing as part of their wider focus on 
media law and copyright, specifically in their third-year Web 
Media course. 

Most students, Charles says, are happy to give their work 
an open licence. Occasionally a photographer will want to 
maintain 'all rights reserved' copyright; otherwise, Charles 
says, ''We keep everything open." 

But what about when students graduate? Charles notes 
that his students may not always have the choice to use open 
licensing, especially if they work for more conventional news 
organisations. "But if they're going to end up in Public Relations, 
using Creative Commons makes a lot of sense, really. We have 
quite a few that go into that. I would expect that they would 
write under Creative Commons." 

While noting that Creative Commons licensing is still a 
new concept for many, Charles points out that the licences 
have been a success for Wintec's journalism students. "It works 
fantastically for us." 




New Zealand’s Open Educational 
Resource Foundation and Universitas 



by Wayne Mackintosh, Founder, Open Educational 
Resource Foundation 

The Open Educational Resource universitas (OERu) provides 
free learning opportunities for all students worldwide using 
courses based solely on Open Educational Resources (OERs) 
and Open Access materials with pathways for learners to 
earn credible degrees. The OER Foundation, headquartered 
in New Zealand, is leading an international innovation 
partnership of accredited universities, polytechnics and 
community colleges committed to providing more affordable 
education for learners currently excluded from the formal 
higher education sector. 

OERs are materials used to support education that may 
be freely accessed, reused, modified and shared by anyone . 1 
Creative Commons licences are enabling an international 
network of accredited universities and polytechnics to 
widen access to more affordable degrees. The OER Tertiary 
Education Network, the driving force behind the OER 
universitas collaboration, have adopted the Free Cultural 
Works approved licences (CC BY and CC BY-SA) as the 
default for OERu courses. 

With OER, the marginal cost of replicating digital learning 
materials is near zero, and sharing development costs improves 
cost efficiencies. Consequently, an international network of 




1 WWW.downeS.Ca/pOSt/579i5 



accredited institutions can create significant savings in the 
cost and time required for the assembly and maintenance of 
OER courses, combined with significant efficiency gains when 
operating at scale. Moreover, OER provides a viable solution 
for educational institutions to respond to their educational 
mission of social inclusion. 

The scale is guaranteed because of the unsatisfied global 
demand for higher education. Researchers at UNESCO and 
the Commonwealth of Learning conservatively predict that 
over the next 15 years the post-secondary education system 
will need to provide for an additional 100 million places. The 
conventional model of higher education provision is simply 
not able to respond to this level of demand for education. 

The confluence of these economic and digital technology 
enablers provide fertile ground for designing a sustainable 
open education ecosystem whereby institutions can provide 
free access to learning opportunities. Building on Professor 
Emeritus Jim Taylor's 2007 ideas to provide assessment on 
demand, the OERu concept was conceived. 

Individuals are free to learn from digital materials hosted 
on the open web. The problem is that learners who access 
digital OERs on the web and acquire knowledge and skills 
either formally or informally, alone or in groups, cannot 
readily have their learning assessed and subsequently receive 
appropriate academic recognition for their efforts. 

OERu learners gain free access to high-quality courses that 
are designed for independent study using OER. OERu learners 
receive student support through a global network of volunteers 



and peer support using social software technologies. Students 
can be assessed for a fee by participating institutions and earn a 
credible credential. Using OER it is possible to build a parallel 
learning universe to provide more affordable education for 
learners currently excluded from the formal education sector. 

With a healthy dose of our Kiwi "can do" attitude, which 
favours pragmatism above pretence, in November 2011 the 
OER Foundation convened an open meeting of founding 
anchor partners to plan the practical implementation of the 
OERu. With funding support from UNESCO, this landmark 
meeting was streamed live on the internet, modelling open 
participation and collaboration on a global scale. Five tertiary 
education institutions in New Zealand have embraced their 
responsibility to ensure more sustainable education futures 
by joining the OERu network as founding anchor partners. 
Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology Te Whare 
Wananga o Te Tau Ihu o Te Waka A Maui, NorthTec Tai 
Tokerau Wananga, the Open Polytechnic Kuratini Tuwhera, 
Otago Polytechnic Te Kura Matakini ki Otago, and the 
University of Canterbury Te Whare Wananga o Waitaha are 
the New Zealand institutions that are leading open education 
futures in Aotearoa. The OERu network, now numbering 20 
contributing institutions, can accredit OER learning on five 
continents mapped to the credentialing frameworks of 20 
different countries. 

The vision of the OERu collaboration became reality 
in 2012 with the launch of the first OERu course, Regional 
Relations in Asia and the Pacific (AST1000), developed by 



the University of Southern Queensland (USQ). Professor 
Jan Thomas, Vice Chancellor and President of USQ, noted 
that: “USQ is proud to give students worldwide the ability 
to access university-level courses and where cost has been 
removed as a barrier to learning." 

University leaders and administrators are concerned with 
how to ensure sustainability of OER initiatives on campus. 
Indeed, if OER projects are managed as an add-on to existing 
operations, the sources of funding to sustain OER projects can 
be a challenge. However, the strategic solution is to embed OER 
development as an integral component of business as usual. 

From an investment-decision perspective, participation 
in the OERu does not require new money, but rather a 
reallocation of existing staff time to releasing selected 
development outputs under open content licences for the 
OERu network as part of mainstream operations. The OERu 
model anticipates that no more than 1% of existing budget time 
would be required for release under open content licences. 
The institutional costs of assessment and credentialisation 
services are recouped on a cost-recovery basis from student 
fees and/or other sources. 

Consider for example that the average tuition fees for a 
four-year bachelor degree at a public university in the United 
States is US$26,312, excluding accommodation and textbook 
costs. At Otago Polytechnic, the full tuition cost of a four- 
year degree equivalent is approximately US$19,452. The 
summative assessment and credentialing services for the first 
OERu prototype course would equate to a four-year bachelor 



degree costing US$6,759. As the OERu network grows and 
begins to leverage economies of scale, it is feasible that further 
cost reductions can be implemented. 

The OERu network has succeeded in shifting the strategic 
focus of open education from how to achieve sustainable OER 
projects to how institutions will remain sustainable without 
the mainstream adoption of OER. 

The OERu model is inspired by the concept of "smart 
philanthropy". While the OERu is primarily designed to 
widen access to learning in higher education through the 
social inclusion and community service agenda, our approach 
encourages member institutions to reintegrate the lessons 
learned into mainstream operations. Tacit knowledge and 
capability gained through the OERu's open design and 
development model can be reinvested back into the core 
business operations to improve effectiveness of the higher 
education sector and generate new business opportunities 
now possible with the OERu model. The OERu network is an 
exemplar for low-cost, low-risk, but high-impact innovation. 




Otago Polytechnic 



Otago Polytechnic Te Kura Matatini ki Otago is a publicly 
subsidised vocational education and training organisation 
located in Dunedin, in the South Island of New Zealand 
Aotearoa. It provides a range of vocational courses, offering 
certificates, diplomas, degrees and postgraduate studies in 
everything from Travel and Tourism, through Automotive 
Engineering, to Midwifery. 

Taking an open view of teaching, learning and research, 
Otago Polytechnic has reconsidered its stance on access to 
educational resources, then governed by traditional views 
of ownership and intellectual property. Stakeholders were 
consulted in a 2008 review, the resulting feedback from which 
said that the institution needed to be more open to support 
creative thinking and the application of theory to practice. 
This culminated in the announcement in March 2008 that 
Otago Polytechnic was releasing its training materials under 
Open Access terms on Wikieducator. 

As stated in its current intellectual property policy: "Otago 
Polytechnic wishes to foster research and development that 
advances knowledge and scholarship; and to support projects 
where that leads to marketable products or services. The 
Polytechnic: 

• has a preference for the open sharing of information, 
knowledge and resources; 

• recognises that intellectual property (IP) is owned by 




the creator, unless there are specific agreements to the 
ownership of IP by others; and 
• wishes to foster the empowerment of individuals in 
their endeavours in a protective and/or promotional 
framework for individual creators associated with Otago 
Polytechnic." 

Otago Polytechnic now offers its Open Access courses 
under the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence, 
with the application: "Creative Commons Attribution (Author 
name) for Otago Polytechnic". 

Individual lecturers own their own intellectual property. 
Encouragement and support is given by the institution to use 
CC BY for copyright statements. Where tire Polytechnic is 
used to publish or promote work, a CC BY licence is applied 
wherever possible. Exceptions are made for works where third- 
party content is not or cannot be cleared. Other restrictions (if 
any) are time-based and explained. 

Encouraging open content licences at Otago Polytechnic 
by way of its intellectual property policy has assured 
employees and contractors that they are free to use and 
develop open content, and that they are free to participate in 
Open Educational Resource development initiatives. Many 
staff have now developed independent skills in publishing 
and managing their own content, as well as locating and 
reusing third-party open content, and collaborating in content 
development. The proliferation of open content and associated 
practices has helped to promote the Polytech as well as the 




expertise and services of the individuals in its employ. A more 
independent and participatory culture within the organisation 
is beginning to develop. 

Free and open source software first inspired thinking 
about free and open source educational content. The success 
of Wikimedia Foundation projects proved the idea viable. 
Support from many individuals and initiatives such as 
Wikieducator has made it possible. 

Otago Polytechnic decided to adopt the CC BY licence so 
as to ensure a maximum amount of freedom and flexibility for 
itself and for people and organisations sampling its content. 
Restrictions like ShareAlike and Noncommercial were not an 
option as they would have compromised or complicated this 
position. 




Creative Commons in New Zealand Schools 



Imagine if every teacher in New Zealand - all 100,000 of them 
- could make, share and adapt open educational resources 
and that all these resources were available in a single place. 
We would no longer see teachers wasting time re-inventing 
resources that have already been made. Instead, every teacher 
would have easy access to the collective intelligence of the 
entire teaching profession, waiting to be localised, adapted 
and improved. 

Sounds good, doesn't it? The only problem for New Zealand 
teachers is that their employers - usually, their Board of 
Trustees - hold first ownership of copyright works produced 
in the course of employment. As the Ministry of Education's 
information portal, Te Kete Ipurangi, points out, this means 
that, "unless agreed otherwise, the school will own the 
copyright in any teaching materials that teachers (employees) 
create during the course of their employment." 

Simply put, this means that teachers who share resources 
may be infringing their school's copyright. 

To solve this problem - and to actively encourage the use 
of open educational resources - some New Zealand schools 
have chosen to implement Creative Commons policies. These 
policies allow and encourage the use of Creative Commons 
licensing for their school's teaching resources. In essence, they 
make it legal for teachers to share. 

As of mid-2015, over 100 New Zealand schools have 
adopted a Creative Commons policy. This includes some of 



our largest high schools, such as Hutt Valley High School and 
Burnside High School. 

Kiwi teachers have always shared, remixed and reused their 
resources but they haven't always done so in a sustainable way. 
With Creative Commons licensing, and online repositories 
and sharing portals like Wikieducator and the Network for 
Learning's Pond, the potential pool of legally reusable resources 
is becoming much, much larger. 

The Albany Story 

One of the first schools to adopt a Creative Commons policy 
was Albany Senior High School on Auckland's North Shore, 
in 2012. 

Former Deputy Principal of Albany Senior High School, 
Mark Osborne, says that the policy allows, and even encourages, 
teachers to, as Mark puts it, "share the family silver". 

"Sharing resources," he notes, "is something teachers have 
done since teaching started ... and most people don't realise 
they're breaking the law by doing that." 

The Albany Creative Commons policy ensures that 
teachers "feel free to contribute to Open Educational Resources 
projects without having written permission from our Board of 
Trustees". The Board itself saw the advantages of students and 
teachers joining the growing international OER community. 

As Osborne says, "When we were putting our vision for 
the school together, and our vision for our students, we knew 
that there were real opportunities. We wanted collaboration, 
sharing and community." 



Mark Osborne hopes that other schools have a look at the 
resources available online, and begin a conversation with 
their Boards of Trustees about formulating their own Creative 
Commons policies. As more schools participate, the OER 
movement will enjoy what Mark calls a "network effect" - 
the exponential benefit of having thousands of New Zealand 
teachers building and sharing Creative Commons-licensed 
resources. 

"The big change taking place," Mark says, "is that teachers 
are collaborating more, and they're also involving their 
students in the development of those teaching and learning 
resources. This is quite different from what happens in most 
schools." 

"Why Aren't You Doing This?" 

Warrington School is a small primary school in Otago's 
Blueskin Bay. With five teachers and around fifty students, 
Warrington has embraced both open source software and 
Creative Commons licences. 

Warrington's former principal, Nathan Parker, came 
to Creative Commons licences through open software like 
Ubuntu, Linux and Open Office. Wayne Mackintosh, of 
the Open Educational Resources Foundation, noticed what 
Warrington was doing, and invited Nathan to start sharing 
teaching resources on Wikieducator. 

Hosted by Otago Polytechnic, Wikieducator is a platform 
for teachers across the world to share, remix and reuse 
educational materials. Dozens of schools around New Zealand 




are using the wiki through New Zealand's Open Educational 
Resources portal. 

However, as Nathan quickly discovered, the school's 
Board of Trustees held the copyright to all resources produced 
by Warrington's teachers. “We soon realised," Nathan says, 
“that we couldn't put our resources on the wiki, because we 
as teachers don't own it." By sharing their teaching resources 
on Wikieducator, the teachers of Warrington School were 
breaking the law. 

In order to prevent copyright violation, the school “needed 
to formalise the change through a Creative Commons policy". 
As was the case with Albany Senior High School, Nathan 
found that his Board of Trustees was "very happy" to give 
advance permission for teachers to share their resources. The 
board saw that “being able to share ideas and allowing other 
teachers to improve or add to our teaching resources was a 
smart move for education". 

Warrington School also runs its own radio station, Blueskin 
Bay FM . The station hosts student and community programmes, 
and plays music with Creative Commons licences. As Nathan 
explains, "If we play copyright music, we have to pay licensing 
fees. Using Creative Commons music, we don't need to ask 
permission, and we don't need to pay, and the radio station 
just ticks along." 

After moving to open source software and Creative 
Commons licensing, Warrington has found a greater 
awareness of copyright and open licensing in the students, 
the teachers, and even the wider community. 



"When I look outside at other schools, I think, why aren't 
you doing this?" 

Getting on Board with Open Education 

Taupaki School's Board of Trustees (BoT) passed its Creative 
Commons policy on 20 February 2013, giving permission to 
Taupaki's teachers to share and collaborate, legally. 

Paula Hogg has been the chair of the Taupaki BoT since 
2012, and oversaw the passage of the Creative Commons 
policy. As Paula explains, the idea for the policy was initially 
introduced by the school's principal, Stephen Lethbridge. 
While the BoT didn't have any specific expertise on copyright 
or intellectual property, Stephen ensured that they had all the 
necessary information. 

"We got a great letter from Stephen outlining all the issues, 
and, following that, we put it on the agenda for the next 
meeting. Stephen provided a lot of information for us to read 
prior to that meeting, so we felt quite well prepared." 

Nevertheless, copyright and intellectual property were 
new issues for the BoT. As Paula says, "Creative Commons 
was something we'd never heard of - it wasn't even on the 
periphery. While we were aware of copyright laws, we were 
not as well informed around exactly what was Board- and 
teacher-owned." 

Stephen Lethbridge introduced the idea of the policy 
after noticing that, as he put it in a blog post, "Teachers were 
sharing more and more resources online and connecting with 
a great many schools who were visiting us. It would have been 



a nightmare to seek permission from the Board, more likely 
the school principal, every time a teacher or student wanted to 
share information." 

As Paula points out, the policy is also strongly aligned 
with the school's existing vision. "Our school's vision strongly 
encourages collaboration, and we encourage sharing, so it was 
a bit of a shock to learn that we needed to have a policy for 
teachers to share legally." 

"The Creative Commons policy was very aligned with our 
thinking as a board. There was no dissonance in our discussion. 
The main issue was that everyone was surprised to discover 
that this isn't normal practice." 

According to Paula, the Creative Commons policy 
passed because it supported the fundamental mission of the 
school - improving student outcomes. "We knew from the 
documentation Stephen provided, and from other background 
reading, that professional development is actually one of the 
best ways to lift student outcomes . And a big part of professional 
development is sharing best practice, including resources." 

Paula also points out the importance of BoTs aligning 
their schools with existing government policy. While the 
New Zealand Government's Open Access and Licensing 
framework encourages schools to use Creative Commons to 
release copyright works, relatively few schools are aware that 
the policy exists. 

Given the number of policy and procedural issues 
confronting schools, it's also unlikely that BoTs will seek out 
additional policy changes that aren't brought to their attention. 



"It's important that Boards don't just view this as a legal 
obligation and stop there. It does encompass a lot more than 
that, and if s important that Boards are aware of that." 

Stephen says, "School leaders need to revisit their 
intellectual property documentation. Creative Commons 
in Schools isn't about abdicating responsibility and a 'copy 
anything' approach. It is about acknowledgement, respect and 
attribution where the licence is determined by the creators of 
amazing information, resources and ideas within our schools." 




WikiHouse New Zealand 



WikiHouse is an ambitious global project that aims to 
allow anyone to design, download and 'print' houses and 
components from standard sheets of construction-grade ply, 
using a computer-driven router. These components can be 
assembled with minimal formal skill or training. 

The philosophy behind WikiHouse is thousands of years 
old: a community of people work together to build a house 
that is affordable. They share labour, tools and food. Then they 
work together to build the next one, and so on... 

In Western countries, that's been made much more difficult 
by increasingly complex building regulations, the high cost 
of consents, labour and materials, and a drift away from 
community to individualism. Against that, communications 
technology has made it possible to collaborate across countries 
and to share many phases of a project. Just as open source 
software has become a major force in computing, so WikiHouse 
- an open source construction system - is set to become a major 
force in housing. Many designers across several countries are 
collaborating to make it simple for everyone to design, print 
and assemble beautiful, low-energy homes, customised to 
their needs. 

WikiHouse had its beginnings in tire United Kingdom in 
2011, when architect Alastair Parvin and design partner Nick 
Ierodiaconou were invited to do an exhibition piece in South 
Korea about open source design communities. Alastair had 
been writing a book that looked at ways of scaling self-build as 



a response to the UK housing crisis. Their immediate response 
was that rather than talk about open design, they should just 
try to do it with an experimental project. This open source 
house ultimately generated great interest worldwide. 

Prior to this, English engineer Martin Luff and Australian 
architect Danny Squires - both now resident in Christchurch 
- started chatting via Twitter about the lack of innovation and 
poorly conceived temporary housing solutions being proposed 
for Christchurch following the disastrous earthquakes that had 
hit the city in 2010 and 2011. 

As Martin puts it, "Danny and I were trying to find a 
solution to a whole number of different issues in the build 
environment. We spent about six months researching different 
systems. During that process, a friend tipped us off to the 
WikiHouse project." 

After the Canterbury earthquakes, over 6,100 businesses 
were displaced from the central city. "Few of those have gone 
back to their original location," Martin says. "The rest needed 
to relocate somewhere else. We were looking for a system 
whereby, in the worst-case scenario, within a few weeks you 
could relocate your business and be back up and running." 

Martin and Danny were also keen to empower the local 
community. "A lot of people down here in Canterbury are stuck 
in limbo because they are dependent on a whole hierarchy of 
other agencies before they can get on with things like repairs 
and replacement housing. 

"One particular thing we were looking for was a system that 
allowed people to be involved right from the get-go, through 



the whole design process, right the way to implementation. One 
of the really nice things about WikiHouse is that the people can 
really assemble the things on the ground themselves, as well as 
being involved in the whole design process along the way. One 
of the main things we were looking at was empowerment." 

They quickly realised the WikiHouse project had the 
potential to meet all the needs they had identified, plus some. 
They contacted Alastair and the UK team to propose forming a 
New Zealand hub to develop a Tab' here, and from early 2012 
began working intensively to develop the WikiHouse system, 
gather support and put in place a scalable management and 
supply system to support the level of scaling which they 
envisaged. 

Martin and Danny also wanted to ensure that what they 
produced was healthier, stronger and more environmentally 
friendly than the current housing stock. "We wanted it to 
be world-class in terms of its ability to stand up to seismic 
resistance. We also wanted it, longer-term, to go beyond 
sustainability to something that could be restorative to our 
environment." 

Creative Commons licensing is a core part of WikiHouse. 
Martin explains, "There are ten core principles, and principle 
number one is be lazy like a fox. Don't reinvent the wheel. 
Copy, adapt, give credit and share." 

Creative Commons licensing enables WikiHouse teams 
from around the world to collaborate and improve on each 
other's designs. By way of example, Martin explains that the 
initial WikiHouse design "had a lot of mechanical fixings in 



it. A collective design effort quickly eliminated the need for 
those. The system we've got at the moment can be put together 
without power tools, by unskilled people in a very short length 
of time. There are no mechanical fixings in it, no bolts or screws 
or glue." 

By May 2012, the New Zealand team had presented at a 
Sustainable Habitat Challenge workshop and picked up the 
first award for WikiHouse for commercialisation of sustainable 
buildings. Soon after, they were given a commendation 
from New Zealand Institute of Architects regional 
branch for a Canterbury Pavilion concept. In the UK, the 
WikiHouseUK team were presented with the Royal Institute 
of British Architects President's gold award for research. As a 
consequence, WikiHouse received significant global exposure 
and positive reviews in a variety of media channels, including 
CNN, Wired, Forbes, The Guardian, Engadget, and Popular 
Science. This led up to Alastair being invited to give a TED talk 
in spring 2013 which gathered a million viewers worldwide. 

A major step forward came when Martin and Danny, along 
with other members of the WikiHouseNZ team, unveiled the 
first full-sized proof of concept structure during Makertorium, 
an event at Te Papa, Wellington, in May 2013 which was billed 
as "a showcase of Kiwi ingenuity". 

This was the first full-scale WikiHouse frame on the ground 
in the Southern Hemisphere. The frame itself was cut on a router 
at the Fab Lab at Massey University in Wellington and later 
shipped to Christchurch. Primarily for the purposes of physical 
testing and engineering assessment, it is also a showpiece 



for various organisations and individuals and will provide 
a platform for further work and development of applicable 
cladding and lining systems, along with the other elements 
required for a livable 21st-century dwelling. 

The Te Papa event was capped by the Mayor of Wellington, 
Celia Wade-Brown, making the capital city the first to write 
WikiHouse into its official housing policy. 

Further design development has been carried out in 
Christchurch, and a large team of mostly volunteers is working 
hard towards the next goal, a fully consented "BackYarder" 
show home. WikiHouseNZ was granted funding of $300,000 
from The Canterbury Community Trust to realise this project, 
which it is hoped to have erected in the latter part of 2015. 

While New Zealand is one of the two most active hubs 
internationally, worldwide there is now a loose community 
of approximately 500-600 people, 10 chapters and roughly 40 
people working full- or part-time on WikiHouse projects. 

Going forward, Martin sees WikiHouse taking off through 
a series of local projects, “probably neighbourhood-based 
manufacturing plants, where local people can drop in, not 
just to build buildings, but all sorts of other things as well". 
This global network of community-based organisations is 
where Creative Commons licensing becomes important. 

“We really see this as a social enterprise, and it's only going 
to work if we can deliver on scale - very large scale. One of the 
workshops we're setting up in the WikiHouse project is in Rio. 
The global perspective on the project is that in the next 40 to 
50 years, if the projections hold true, we've got to have built as 



much urban development globally as currently is in existence. 
This is mind-boggling. We can't do that with conventional 
building techniques or without openly working together on 
solutions." 

"As I see it, if you're shutting away that information, the 
things that you learn, if s essentially a waste-stream. It seems 
critical that, as far as possible, you're open. If you take the 
bigger picture, it can seem a bit petty to fence that knowledge 
away, and charge people to access it; especially since any new 
idea only ever builds incrementally on all the knowledge and 
wisdom that went before. Creative Commons seems like a 
great way to acknowledge that." 

Open source hardware, however, is still a new concept, 
especially for highly-regulated industries like construction. 
"It's much trickier to get the globally distributed network right, 
especially when it's a mix of professionals and amateurs." 

But despite the challenges - perhaps because of them - the 
team are working hard to develop adaptable housing designs 
that will empower people to create their own communities, 
with the aim of giving people the ability to create their own 
high-performance living environments, to suit their own 
purposes.

What is copyright? 

Copyright is a form of intellectual property that is granted 
by the law automatically upon creation of a work. It prevents 
people other than the creator from making copies of (including 
adapting, sharing or performing) that work without the 
creator's express permission. Copyright applies online and 
generally lasts for the life of the creator plus fifty years. 

What is a Creative Commons licence? 

It is a way of giving others permission in advance to copy and 
reuse your works under certain specific conditions that you 
choose. 

Do I have to pay or register to use Creative Commons? 

No, the licences are free to use and are unregistered. 

What does 'Noncommercial’ mean? 

CC's Noncommercial (NC) licences prohibit uses that are 
primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage 
or monetary compensation. This definition does not turn on the 
type of user: if you are a non-profit or charitable organisation, 
your use of an NC-licensed work could still run afoul of the NC 
restriction, and if you are a for-profit entity, your use of an NC- 
licensed work does not necessarily mean you have violated the 
term. Whether a use is commercial will depend on the specifics 
of the situation and the intentions of the user. 




What does Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand 
(CCANZ) do? 

We are the kaitiaki of the New Zealand Creative Commons 
licences that enable the voluntary sharing of copyright material 
in Aotearoa. We're a Kiwi remix on an international movement 
toward Open Access licensing and are here to support the use 
of Creative Commons licences in New Zealand.
