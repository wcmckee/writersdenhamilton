Antony was running low of the substance. He had just enough to give Detective an injection when he awoke. 
once there live a man who lived in a big house
hr had everything he wanted in that house. To tell you the gftruth that house was in fact
not a house but it was a spaceship. 

Vanessa had located Antonys ship. She didn't want to get too close to hi sship or 
he might notice her. She decided to 
exit her spaceship and travel through space towards his ship - getting a 
good inside - and maybe even entering the shiop. She had left her ship out of the rador of his ship. If he was scanning then 
her ship would
be detected. Vanessa stepped into the suit. It had been specially designed to have boosters elements so that she is able to 
travel in the space
quickly for a short period of time. The booster wasn't able to be detected from the ships rador and Vanessa was able to grab 
onto Antonys ship and view through the windows on what was happenig. Vanessa peaked through the window. She could see 
Detective straped to a chair. His arms and legs were tied down with leather straps. Detective was sitting in a seat 
across from him - drinking a cup of coffee. From what Sarah could see Detective looked alive. He was sleeping but he had life
in him. 'What did Antony do to bring him back to life?' Sarah wondered, scratching her head. She needed to get inside the ship.
She needed to wake Detective and capture Antony. She was going to need to find a way to break into the ship without being 
detected. The emergency hatches were all alarmed so unless she was able to get in there without setting the alarms off that 
was out of the question. Cutting through the ship or finding an unsecure entry was the only way. 

Sarah had with her a communcation
device with her that allowed 6b345 to scan events and give suggestions on the next course of step. '6b345 do you come in', 
Sarah spoke into the microphone. 'This is 6b345 responding. You are coming in clear Sarah,' the voice of 6b345 replied. 
'Can you get a scan done on that ship, I need to know how I can get in without setting off the alarms,' Sarah asked. 
'Scan Complete. Solution Found. I have sent the location and instructions for entry to the ship to your suits computer'. 
New data recided the led lights blinked. Vanessa had recieved the information on how to get into the ship without being notived.
She loaded the data up on her suits monitor. The plan looked safe and easy enough. She was worried about time and would have 
to move quickly to get these steps completed. Vanessa was confident in her ability to complete the tasks. She boosted forward
keeping an eye out for a partical entry latch. She circled the ship several times before she finally spotted it. She moved 
closer, reaching into her 


Blah blah blah said Antony. Waiting for Detective to wakeup 
felt like a lifetime. He brewed him many cups of coffee and played endless video games well waiting. There was nothing to do 
except to wait.
Antony often wondered what Detective would be doing at that point. He had no idea where Detective would be or what time. 
There was a chance 
that he could experience multi timelines on his travels. 

His head hurt. The pain shot through his left side of the brain. He wanted to move, to get up. Stand up.
Move. He was straped down.  The leather straps overing his wrists and angles. Looking around he reconised the enviorment.
It was a prewar space ship. They didn't make them like this anymore. Everything about it was vintage. From the colour choices
to the style of the screws used to put the ship others. He tried to lift his right arm. It was straped down with a leather 
wrist. 'Help', Detective calls out. There is no responce. Alone on a ship and straped to a chair. The ship didn't sound like
it was on. The engines were silent. Looking over and out the window all he could see was darkness. Detective knew something 
had changed. Antony was here before and now he's gone. The future changed when Detective went back. Now he was stuck here 
straped to a chair with nobody on board. He tried to think about the last timeline he had experienced. Detective had grown 
in control of the visions now, he was able to control them by stepping back and forward from the various lines. Sometimes
he finds it easier to experience one line over another, it all depend though. He could see a reflection of himself in the ships
window. His head was scabbed and bleeding. He had grown red sores all over his body which pussed with ooze. Detective couldn't 
bear it. He clentched closed his eyes. The vision was still there though, another line where his face is normal, where there 
are no scars. This is the future he wants. It's what he deserves. Detective has saved everyone.

Detective found and captured Antony at a technolgy conference. It is the same conference Joey and Vanessa meet in. When 
Detective gets sent back
from the spaceship he travels to a range of different times and chances many events. One events being the conference that 
captures Antony at. Antony then actives the time switch on himself and is sent to another time. Detective and Antony are 
chasing each other. The story tells all the events and different timeline and how various characters. Events are changed,
changing the future that backfires. 

The is a journal through space and time following a series of characters in various evolutional series of the human race. 
An AI system is developed that clashes with an dying Alien lifeform developing part-alien, part-human child. This carries
on with mixing cat with the part-alien, part-human dna. The Human race is wiped out therefore people are sent back to attempt
to change events that lead. Sarahs Moon Training, Sarahs Moon Trip, Presidents Speech, Loth'Rak bringing Antony to Eath, 
Antony leaving Earth for mars, Antony killing Sarah, Sarah and Joey Time Splet room, robotic takeover - saves Loth'Rak 
race. Antony is never created. Antony starts showing up in the timeline through the device. No more characters. There is 
already enough characters. There are some characters I'd like to merge into one or at least get new names. Structure could 
really be looked at but that's something for the editing stages. For now just get down enough words to be a winner. 
 
The figure walked down the road. Behind it the building was alight. Rich red flames burst from the ceiling. Mid gray smoke
bilowed out above being blow to nearby houses with the strong wind. The CEO had just been enformed that the building was 
burning. The govt had been using it for top secret NSA and NASA missions. They had trained Sarah there to carry out the 
Moon and Mars missions. As time distance increased they lost control of how much they could trace and relized that some 
of the ai bots had lost comunaction with mission control. Sarah must findout what happened to the bots. She investages the 
scene on the Moon where a weapon battle took place between what looked like govt ai bots turning on each other. Govt denies
clame to any of these. Govt in meantime is scrambling to find out what happened to a secection of their bots on the Moon that
mrysterious go offline and are not responding to connection attempts. Cameras and all onboard security features were disabled.
Antony takes control of one of the bots - known as 6b345. He uses it to destory Earth and brings Sarah back to Mars with 6b345.
Once on Mars Antony kills Sarah and takes full control of 6b345. Vanessa later takes control of 6b345 when Antony escapes Mars
kidnaping Detective on his escape. Vanessa tracks down Antonys ship, boarding it and killing Antony. She uses the timeswitch
device to go back and find Detective. He awakes to find nobody there. Vanessa arrives to rescure him. Detective was woken by
a noise inside the ship. One of the ships doors had opened. Someone had entered the ship. Detective paniced. Who would be in 
the ship? He dreaded that it would be Antony. His goals in the past were to stop Antony from completeing his goals. Dective 
thought it was a success when he awoke and Antony wasn't here. Detecive was relieved when a woman stood in front of him, 
not Antony. 'I'm here to get you out of here', the woman told Antony. He was releaved to hear those voices. He checked his
face in the ships window reflection. It was normal. His face was normal. He had successfully saved his appearence. Vanessa
intruduced herself to him, untying the leather straps that held his arms and legs. Detective was releaved to be free. For too
long he had been tied to that chair. He is happy to be free and jumps into the air with joy. Vanessa hurries Detective along
they must get out of here and back to Mars. Vanessa takes control of Antonys ship and drives it back to Mars with Vanessas
ship following behind on autopilet 	

The Bee was the first live being that Antony had attempted to perform. He stuned the bee and injected his dna into the system,
boosting the bee back to life. The Bee grew large and agressive. Antony had to shoot the creation with the ray gun. 

Detective gets his hands on a ray gun and kills Ugnanka and attempts to kill Joey and Sarah. In one timeline he isn't there, 
on the other he is. Crossing over happens all over the story. For example Detective find himself collabsed in another timelines
and drags the body into the cubard so when Sarah and Joey look they don't see him. They find it strange though. 

The Presidents Speech is important. It is told from many different perspectives and timelines. Detective has different roles 
and goals each version of him there. He gives a speech after the president. Detective saves Joey who is in the crowd and would
be killed by the attack. Sarah is a girl watchign the speech from television with her Mother. 
Detective uses a stun gun on Joeys parents in order to get him out of there safely. Police notice the weird occurences of 
Detectives skills and start to investage into him. Detective is spose kill Joey at the conference but knows he's not spose
to. Antony shows up at conference to do it himself and Detective captures Antony. Then Antony actives the timesplit device
and caused the two to travel to another time. 

The Humans on Earth developed an AI system by using alien technology that is sent back in time in order to change events. The 
technology sent back was Detective. They studied him and learnt how to beat his species, to save themselves. The Humans believed
that Loth'Rak and his son - Antony are behind the attack on Earth which wipes out mankind. People are sent back to change this
- making sure that events take place in order to secure 80,000 humans are taken to Mars to be preserved. Story followed events
to active these humans on Mars and the events following it. Basically it's about mankinds fight for survival over Earth is 
destoried and various conflects. 

Antony tried to talk to Loth'Rak about something but he should shot him down. This made Antony sad.
