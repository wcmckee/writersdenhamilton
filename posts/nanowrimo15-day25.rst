This was a massive journey for many of the characters. Detective was one of the
main characters. He started off just as a character that ItWillBeMine that
interacts with Vanessa when she is arrested at school. Ended up using the
name Detective for a range of events - developing into a full
character. I hope the place goes like a winner. If this is going to be
the end then he needed to make the most of it.

Antony knew that Vanessa would be on the way. She would of reviewed
the security tapes and be attempting to locate with the gps. That was
the only way she would do it. She would come alone with Joey back at
the station as support for the mission. It was highly likely that she
wouldn't drive her ship near out of fear that Antony would spot
it. Antony knew of booster packs that Vanessa might be using on the
mission. After all she was a smart cookie, being able to track him
down. Antony had a plan to make it so that when Vanessa showed up at
the ship to get him, she wasn't going to be able to find him. Antony
had found a way to hop between multipy timelines. He had gained much
skill at it. By focusing he was able to move himself from one timeline
to another. He had one problem though he had planned to return to the
other timeline but was having problems with attempting to do so. It
seemed that one of the character - Joey posed an ability to hamper
Antonys power useless. He was unable to cross the timeline and get
back. Antony had attempted to warn himself - his past self about the
dangers that were about to unfold with his plan. It had all been
unsuccessful. Everything he did couldn't change the past. It annoyed
him so much. He went into a rage and tore apart the world. His anger
destoried the planet.
