Do you have a certain place at home for reading?

When I am home I read from bed. 

Bookmark or a random piece of paper?

I rarely read paper books but if I do - won't use anything and just close the book. Would have to guess where I was up to if I did read the book again. 

If I had to choose between a bookmark or random piece of paper I would go with piece of paper. It's more me. 

Can you stop reading anytime you want or do you have to stop at a certain page, chapter, part, etc.?

I can stop anytime - middle of the page. If I am towards the end I try to sprint. Get asked to make my Brother food and I'll put the book down and complete the requested tasks.

Reading at home or everywhere?

When I am out I read on public transport and when I am walking. Sometimes when I visit my Brother and can't get access to his computer (because he is using it) I will read. 

Can you read while listening to music/watching TV?

I often read while listening to music. Pandora radio is blasting from my monitor 24 hours a day.

One book at a time, or several at once?

I focus on one book at a time. There are times when I stop reading a book and start something else. I may come back to the unfinished book. War and Peace is an example of this.

Reading out loud or silently in your head?

Silently in my head. Always.

Do you read ahead or skip pages?

If I am not enjoying it I will read quickly and skim pages. Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix is an example. 

Breaking the spine or keeping it new?

Treat books with respect and try to keep it new. I have no paperbooks at home (a few at my Mothers).

Do you write in books?

I have never written in books. Do not use the note features that Kindle offers either.
