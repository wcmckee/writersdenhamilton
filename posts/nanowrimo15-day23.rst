Antony was running low of the substance. He had just enough to give Detective an injection when he awoke. 
once there live a man who lived in a big house
hr had everything he wanted in that house. To tell you the gftruth that house was in fact
not a house but it was a spaceship. 

Vanessa had located Antonys ship. She didn't want to get too close to hi sship or 
he might notice her. She decided to 
exit her spaceship and travel through space towards his ship - getting a 
good inside - and maybe even entering the shiop. 

Blah blah blah said Antony. Waiting for Detective to wakeup 
felt like a lifetime. He brewed him many cups of coffee and played endless video games well waiting. There was nothing to do except to wait.
Antony often wondered what Detective would be doing at that point. He had no idea where Detective would be or what time. There was a chance 
that he could experience multi timelines on his travels. 


His head hurt. The pain shot through his left side of the brain. He wanted to movevv, to get up. Stand up.
Move. He was straped down.  The leather straps overing his wrists and angles.
