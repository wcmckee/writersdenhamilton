The Grapes of Wrath is an American realist novel written by John 
Steinbeck and published in 1939. 

Every time I finish a book I need to review it. This is my review of The
Grapes of Wrath. I choose to read the book because I was feeling frustrated 
and it had the word wrath in the title. 

At 464 it wasn't a long read and I was able to understand the majority 
of the structure of the book. The conversation style of the characters 
was very South American accent - certainly a change from the more 
English and formal conversations that the majority of the novels I read 
have. It's not annoying though, I am able to translate it to proper 
English - along with having the characters talk in this Southern accent 
in my head. 

The novel followed the Joad family as they travel from their home in Oklahoma to 
California. Chapters are split with a narrative of overall picture of those
that are leaving their homes in search for a better life. There were also
glimpses of other characters that were not part of the Joad family travels.
This reminds me of the style of War and Peace - which switches between characters conversations in their homes and the overall of the war.

Despite the hard times faced I found areas of the book humorous. Flushing 
toilets were a new experience for members of the Joads family when they 
were living in the camps and were surprised and frightened by them. It's something
that you don't even consider today - but as I get older new inventions and
experiences.

John Steinbeck was an excellent writer and I am looking forward to reading
more of his novels. I started Of Mice and Men which follows similar themes
to The Grapes of Wrath. 

The Grapes of Wrath is required reading in many American schools. I can 
understand why - it is a realist look at what it was like to live in 
American during the great depression. Students would learn and understand
how lucky they are to live in this world. 

Ideas with banks and foreclosure is also relevant today with the late-2000s
housing crisis.
