Ideas for Hamilton Computer Club

The theme for the site needs to be bootstrap. No side bar, only top. 

Logo on the top left. Currently the banner on the top of the screen is
a photography of a motherboard. Hamilton Computer Club is in large white
typography. Exchange information and share skills, is below. Slightly 
smaller. A clip art image of a computer is on the right.
