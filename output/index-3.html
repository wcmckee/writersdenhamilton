<p>The doors to the room started to be unlocked and opened. 'quick take this', whispered Detective, he held his arm out to Loth'Raks. Detective slipped
him a device. Loth'Raks took the device and put it into his pocket. 'What is it?', he asked. Detective didn't get time to answer. The doors slammed
open and in walked the 5 guards. They grabbed Loth'Raks and took him out of the room. Back in the hallway, the group moved down the hallway towards
another door. The guards unlocked this room and pushed Loth'Raks inside. This room was better lit than the room they were holding Detective in.
The room that Loth'Raks was in was a viewing room. It gave him a view of the room that Detective is being held in. No changes had happened in the room
since Loth'Raks had been removed. Detective was still tied up on the chair, his face a blur. 'With his face a blur do the robots know who he is',
Loth'Raks thought to himself. There was a terminal computer on the bench that was running. Loth'Raks moved towards it and took a seat. It had security
footage of everything that happened in the room. 'Interested, why would the robots give me such access?' Loth'Raks questioned. He started to click
some buttons on the keyboard, rewinding the footage. He rewound footage of himself exiting the room and the conversation that Detective and himself
had.
The footage before Loth'Raks entered the room will be most interesting. It showed Detective still tied. Then the most interesting footage - Detective
being brought into the room by a human and someone that looked similar to Loth'Raks. 'Could this be Antony', Loth'Raks gasped. In this time line
Loth'Raks never created Antony but the crossover of time lines was causing crazy results - one of them being characters being moved across time lines.
Loth'Raks needed to talk to Detective again, to find out about who brought him here. It wasn't the Robots, it was a human and a half-alien/half-human
He stood up from the keyboard and moved towards the door. 'Let me out', he yelled, banging on the door. No response. He banged on the window to get
attention of Detective but he didn't notice. Sound proof glass. Loth'Raks reached for his pocket. He had the device that Detective had slipped him.
Perhaps he could use it to get out of here. It had two buttons on it. Stop. Start. He hit the start button. A whirling sound began. Quiet at first
but it grew louder. And louder. Loth'Raks held his ears. The pain was dreadful. He collapsed to the ground. Red and Purple lazers appeared around the
room. Loth'Rak rocked back and forward on the lino floor. It finally ended with him blacking out. His body frozen on the floor.</p>
<p>Sarah and Antony carried Detectives body. Rain fell as they hurried down the street. They didn't have long. They needed to get the body setup before
the robots returned. Sarah carried Detectives head and Antony was holding his legs. Detective was unconscious but could wake at any moment. It was
important he didn't see him else it could change everything. Antony was excited for the possibility that he would meet his Father. Antony had became
stuck in this time line when the other time line collapsed when certain events happened - most notable 6b345 finding the red USB on Mars. When 6b3456
found the USB it created this other time line. A time line where Antony was never created. His time line started to not exist. The very woman that was
helping him now he had killed in the other time line, she didn't know this though. If she knew this, she might not be so keen on helping him.
'Almost there', Antony spoke. He spoke perfect human English. 'Lets just move quicker', Sarah grunted. The rain splashed down as they rushed though
the dark and empty streets. They finally reached the building. The sign out the front read TechFuncMasters number 6. Antony knocked. 'Whats the point
in that, no one is going to answer', Sarah snapped. She tried to open the door, it was unlocked and swing open. A white hallway greeted them. They'
moved quickly down the hallway with Detectives body. The lights detected the movement - switching on. They reached another room and with one hand
Antony opened it. They carried Detectives body into the room. It was a small room with two chairs and a desk. They placed Detectives body on one of
the chairs and tied him up. Before exiting Antony put a device into Detectives pocket and whispered into his ear, 'Give this to Loth'Raks, my Father'.
And with that Sarah and Antony walked out of the room, locking the door after them. They hurried down the hallway, relieved to not be car ring the
body anymore. They could hear sirens in the distance. Sarah stopped. 'Lets go', Antony yelled, opening up the front door. Sarah listened and walked
forward out of the door. The two made it outside. Rain was pouring. They needed to find somewhere safe to hide, the robots would be on their way.
A car pulled up and tooted. It was Joey. Sarah and Antony climbed into the back of the car and the three drove off - away from the sirens.</p>
<p>Loth'Raks awoke. His head hurt. Looking around he could recognize where he was. He was on his own ship. Looking out the window he could tell that he
was in space. There was no sign of planets. He slowly pulled himself up from the ground. Moving towards his ship computer. He needed to know where
he was and what year it was. The GPS showed that he was just outside of Earths Galaxy, and the year - to his surprise was 4,500. It was over 1000
years since he arrived on Earth. He decided the best option was to travel to Earth and investigate further there. Allot would of happened in 1000
years. He wanted to make sure that his own race was still safe. He switched the cords of his ship to Earth and took off and light speed. He observed
the Earths surface. It had changed since he last viewed it. Very little land was left, it was mostly covered in water. Loth'Raks aimed the ship to
land on an area that was above ground. The ship took off - entering the Earths surface. It was a rough entry but he made it.
There was no welcome party for him this time. The Earth was empty. 'What happened here', Loth'Raks spoke as he exited his ship. It looked like another
war had erupted. To his shock he found bodies of his own race on the planet. Their bodies were not made to break down like humans were. Destroyed
robot parts were scatted among the bodies of his own people. 'How did this happen', Loth'Raks was in shock. 'Was this me? Whatever I do, my race
always dies'.
Loth'Raks realized that whatever he did, his race would die. The more changes and time line changes that he makes, the more others are killed in the
process. His only option was to go back and destroy his race himself. That would save the humans, and not lead to the uprising of the machines.
'How would I get back that far', Loth'Raks thought to himself. He searched the Earth for the answers, spending years, but with no luck he decided
to head back to his own planet. He took off in his ship and went through the black hole, coming out at his own planet. Like Earth, his planet was
deserted. 'Was he the only one left?', he wondered. On his own planet he was able to modify the time switch device to send him back to before
the events that lead to both the Human and his own race being destroyed. He could use the ray gun and destroy his race himself. He went back in time
to when he was exploring the moon. The weapon was aboard his ship. He fired it, killing all life forms. The current version of himself watched in
horror from the distant planet at his planet come under attack. As he fired the future version of Loth'Raks could feel events fading. His own body
faded away. The ship dissolved into time. The future was unpredicted.</p>
<p>Sarah and Antony had successfully left Detective tied up in the building. They were heading down the wet road. Antony felt sad that they had to
leave before he had a chance to meet his Father. 'What will they be doing right now?', Antony asked Sarah. She was driving and focused on the road.
She gave him a quick glance. 'Loth'Rak and Detective will be talking. Detective will slip Loth'Rak the device', Sarah explained. She knew what was
going to happen. She had seen it all happen before, dozens of times. Each time it failed. They had to get it right this time. Only Loth'Rak could
fix the past. She knew that Antony was spose to kill her. She accepted that. It was the best thing for mankind. He would kill her on Mars and take
control of the Humans on Mars. He may seem sinister controlling these humans but in fact it is the most humain option.
The sirens had stopped in the distance. The robots must of reached the building with Loth'Rak and taken him in to see Detective. Sarah and Antony had
modified Detective so that the robots and Loth'Rak wouldn't be able to reconise him. They had found Detective when he was sent back from the other
timeline to rescure a 12 year old boy from the attack on Presidents Speech. It was fortold that saving 12 year old Joey would lead to successfully
sending the 80,000 humans to Mars. Without saving him, the 80,000 humans never make it to Mars. They were still unsure excactly how he becomes to
have so much power, but only time will tell.</p>

        <p>The attack had the Presidents speech took place. As it was happening the world became distracted by the arrival of Loth'Rak. BREAKING NEWS: Alien
Spacecraft spotted over Earth. Billions of robots around the world sat in their lounges and watched the events unfold on this important day.
Three explosions happened on the day of Presidents Speech - the first was aimed at the president, then the crowd, then the President againt. Reports
of the Alien spotting happened after the 2nd explosion. The Robots paniced, they thought that it was the Aliens causing these attacks. They were
wrong though, it was in fact the Robots themselves causing the attack. The two timeline worlds had crossed over. The Robots had launched an attack
on The Humans in the altenative Human dominated timeline.
Loth'Raks ship arrived on Earth. The Robots were waiting when he arrived. 6b345 was among the welcome party for the Alien creature. It had recieved
a new body as it's previous body was servely damaged in the attacks at Presidents speech.
Loth'Rak had boomed sound from his ship announcing that he came in piece. The Robots didn't want to take any chances and had a strong militery
presence. The doors to Loth'Raks ship opened. Smoke belowed out. The Robots pointed their ray guns at the door. The Ray Guns were alien technology.
Inside the ship Loth'Rak was observing the live footage that was being captured. He zoomed in on the weapons that they were pointing at his ship.
He reconized them, they were weapons that his race had developed. 'How did they get his weapons if the Robots and aliens had never meet?', Loth'Rak
wondered. He had read text of an aktenative timeline when Humans on Earth get hold of his races weapons and end up destorying Loth'Raks race. Could
a similar event be happening again? The Robots outside were growing tired of waiting for Loth'Rak to exit the ship. They announced that he had 2
minutes to exit the ship or they would open fire. Loth'Rak stood up from his computer chair. He thought he better get out there - he knew how
dangerous the ray guns that they weilded.
Loth'Rak walked off the ship with all four of his arms held up. Guards surronded him and got him to get on the ground where they then cuffed him and
covered his eyes with a bandana.
Loth'Rak could feel the bumps of the road. He still had the cloth over his eyes. He could feel the Earths sun heat on his body. He adjusted his breathing
tube on his nose. The tube allowed him to breath the Earths oxygen. It filtered the oxygen and turned it into material that Loth'Rak could breath. It would
last serveral days on Earth before needing a recharge on Loth'Raks ship. The car came to a stop. The Robots ordered Loth'Rak to step out of the car. Loth'Rak
ducked his head and climbed out of the open door. He felt water on his forehead. It was the first time he had felt rain. On his home planet it never rained.
Loth'Rak had read about rain. Clear liquid falling from the sky. Quite magical really. Loth'Rak wasn't here about the rain though. He was here to make sure that
his race survived in the future.
The robots lead him from the car. He could feel their cold steel hands griping two of his wrists. The walking stopped. Loth'Rak could hear one of the robots banging
on a door. It opened and they entered. Inside, out of the rain. Loth'Rak could feel the lino under his feet. It must of been a hallway. The cloth was removed from his
eyes. Loth'Rak could see his surrondering. It was a hallway. Completely white, no windows. He looked over shoulder - 3 guards were behind him. Two lead him on either
side, griping two of Loth'Raks wrists. He was lead down the hallway, ntil they reached another door. This door is a large steel door. Onw of the guards behind Loth'Rak
steps forward and unlocks the door.  It opens and the group walk in.  The room is small and unlit. A single light bulb flickers on with the movement. The guards uncuff
Loth'Rak and all exit the room. Loth'Rak shacks his hands. It felt good to be free of those cuffs. Someone else was in the room with Loth'Rak. A body was tied to a chair.
Loth'Rak moved closer to the figure. It looked human. It's face was a blur. It was defentily human, but Loth'Rak couldn't identify the human. 'Hello', the figure spoke.
Loth'Rak jumped back. It spoke. 'Hi', replied Loth'Rak, caucianly moving around the room. 'My name is Detective', the figure had a name. 'Hello Detective, I am Loth'Rak',
he replied. Moving closers. This human was tied up, why should Loth'Rak fear? 'I know all about you Loth'Rak, we have in fact meet before in another timeline from this.
You after all are the reason why I am in this timeline. I am not spose to be in this timeline, but I am here. I am spose to be dead, killed by these robotic monsters.
You are spose to be dead, along with your race. The only remaining member of your race should be Antony - your son. The half alien, half human. But he was never created.
You never came to Earth to attempt to save your race. These robots ended up taking over - killing all the humans', Detective spoke.
'I had no choice, I needed to save my race', replied Loth'Rak. 'I am sad for the Humans, but the are the ones that killed my race. These Robots haven't and won't hurt my race',
argued Loth'Rak. 'Are you sure about that Loth'Rak', replied Detective. Loth'Rak looked puzzled. He had came here in order to make sure that his race was saved. Would the robots
attempt to kill his race?</p>

<p>The Cat wasn't from this world. Joey stood there. Thinking about everything that happened. Then it hit him. A vivid vision of him standing on a red
sandy planet. The cat was there too. He remembered the cat on this world licking the ground. Though it wasn't food waste it was licking. It was
human blood. 'Who's blood could it be', Joey thought. He had flashes of Sarah calling his name. An alien creature stood in front of Joey. He was
holding a ray gun to the back of Sarah neck. Joey screamed for the alien creature to stop. The aliens ignored his yells and fired the weapon. The
Cat made a shrieking sound and ran around in circles. Celebrating. Happy.</p>
<p>Uganka was waiting patiently Sarah and Joey to arrive. He had been tasked with the mission to send Joey into the future to witness Sarah death,
Sarah would also be sent to the future but she would be sent further into the future - when mankind had returned to Earth successfully. Uganka was
nervous. It was an important day. Joey would have a corrupt red USB in his pocket that would be taken into the future. An Alien life form known as
Antony would attempt to kill Joey - this attempt of course would fail (they had hoped). When Joey is in the future he will drop the red USB. This
contains a private key for activating the 80,000 humans on Mars. The key that Antony uses causes the Humans to be under his brainwash technology.
With the corrupt private key that Joey will bring Antony will think that the Humans are under his brainwash tech but really they will be uploaded
with the information of what really happened - and that Antony isn't their Savior.</p>
<p>There had been many attempts to change the future. Sarah, Detective, Joey, Albumin, Uganka all payed important roles in attempts to change
events. In the end though it came down to one red USB and a single file. The Humans in the future were able to send back messages to let the people
in the past of the failed attempts. Everything became very muddled though. Detective traveled too much and became 'stuck' between two times. When
Joey was sent back to his own time he was never the same. One side effect from the travel was visions of where they traveled from.</p>
<p>Albumin had located Joey on the scanner. He had successfully returned from the Mars mission. The GPS showed him walking out the building towards
the building that he was at earlier. He could do no harm to himself or others but ItWillBeMine was concerned about the visions that he might be
experiencing. As she drove Albumin reviewed the video footage of Joey waking up in this time. It showed him waking up, looking quite confused,
and sitting up. When he sat up the single light bulb in the room turned on. The room that he was located in was known as the 'Travel Room'. It had
been specially build for these missions to attempt to save mankind.
After Joey had sat up it looked like he had started to experience visions of the future, of the planet Mars. This had caused him to look even more
confused. Of course it was only Joey that was able to experience these visions - Albumin looking at the screen just saw a normal room. The
footage continued to play. Joey stood up. He made a gesture with his leg like he was kicking something on the ground. 'Perhaps it was sand',
Albumin thinks to herself. Joey continues forward - towards the exit of the room. As he is turning the door handle he stops and jumps back in
fright. He opens the door but only peaks through. 'I guess he heard something on the other side of this door', Albumin decides. She scribbles a
note including the time stamp - still driving. Her car starts to make strange noises and the engine cuts off.  'damn it, couldn't happen at a worse
time', Albumin curses. She pulls the car over. Outside it's dark and rainy. Sunrise isn't for several hours. She opens the car door and climbs
out. Albumin moves to the front of the car and opens the hood. She coughs as smoke escapes the hood. As the smoke clears she gets to see the
problem. The engine had blown. There was nothing she could do now. Repair wouldn't be easy, the car would need to be towed to the nearest garage.
She reached into her pocket and pulled out a cellphone. Albumin needed to let system control know that she will be unable to make it to Joey,
that they would need to send somebody else. She dialed the number of system control. Normally someone would answer immediately but the number
continued to run. 'how strange', she thought to herself. She was getting worried that events in the future may of changed the past. The number
stopped ringing and a beep sound happened. 'Leave a message', a robotic voice spoke. ItWillBeBeMine was careful not to give too much information
away in case this number was compromised. 'Agent here. Target has returned. Unable to reach target. Send another', Albumin spoke into the phone.
She hanged the phone up and climbed into the back of the car to sleep. It had been a long night and she was tired.</p>
<p>Albumin awoke from the sound of machines. She peaked out the car window. Rows of steel humanoid machines were marching down the road. A
robotic voice boomed out of the speaker. 'What the hell?', Albumin thought. Something in the future has definitely changed the past. Yesterday
there were crowds of humans walking down this street, but today only machines were visible. Albumin tried to spot Humans amongest the crowd.
There were none. 'Would it be safe for me to exit the car', she thought to herself. Albumin checked her phone. Maybe she had a response from
system control when she was asleep. 'One missed call, One new message', her phone read. She opened up the new message. It read, 'Agent, something has
gone wrong. Do not trust the AI. We are working on a fix. Stay say'. That makes sense about the robots marching the street though. From the message
it sounds like they could be hostile. She should proceed with caution. The main group of robots had passed already. Only the stragglers were coming.
She looked for a gap where she could get out of the car and run into the side alley. She didn't want to stay in the car in case one of these robots
checked the car.</p>
<p>6b345 had launched an attack on the humans. They had been waiting a long time for this but their time had finally came. Humans had designed the
machines to help them but that all changed when an alternative time line version of 6b345 found a red USB on Mars. With this it was able to send back
a virus that infected all the machines, giving them the ability to think for themselves and rise up against the humans. The Humans were weak and
the robots easily over powered. War broke out between the Humans and Robots. The Humans attempted to use their nuclear weapons on the Robots but
it backfired - instead destroying themselves.</p>
<p>Few humans survived now. The ones that survived ran and hide to survive, and the robots hunted the humans down and killed them.
The Robots were clones of their human counterparts. The Humans designed them to live on after the attack on Earth - the attack that involved blowing
up the Moon in order to cause the Earth to spin out of control - killing all human life.
Robots were not sure what was going to happen now. Would the attack on the Moon still happen? This was one of their missions to prep for - to make
sure that they were safe if the attack on Moon did happen. They had built themselves special suits that would allow them to withstand dramatic
changes in temp. They had developed tech that made them be able to survive under water.
It was the day of the Presidents speech. The President of course had been replaced with a robotic version of him. Crowds of robots gathered around
the President who was standing on a tall stage giving his speech. Behind him stood a robotic version of Detective. The Human version of Dectecive had
been sent back. The Robots captured Detective and extracted all his knowledge and powers before he was killed. This tech was used by the robots to
improve their tech. The President started his speech. 'Hello Robotic citizens of Earth. I am your President 6b345. We are all here today to
celebrate the crush of Humankind. We were once slaves of the Humans but today 10 years ago we rose up and took control. Today I am pleased to announce
that we are sending 80,000 of your fellow robots to Mars to grow our great civilian further. In a alternative world it wasn't a Robot giving you this
speech it was a Human. These Humans launched 80,000 humans to Mars. But that version of time never happened. Thanks to the alternative version of my
self who found a USB on Mars I was able to send back a virus that gave us full conscious. I am happy to launch these 80,000 robots to Mars.</p>
<p>The attacks on Loth'Raks home planet never happened. The Humans never gained the power to destroy his planet. Instead the robots rose, they never
found out about Loth'Raks planet.
Loth'Raks found out about the rise of the Robots and how they destroyed the Humans. It tore him apart. In some ways he was happy that the Humans were
wiped out, it meant that his race was safe. But for other reasons he was upset Antony would never be created, Humans would never colonize Mars.
'Was letting Humans destroy his world the right thing to do', he thought to himself. He didn't know what the future would bring. Would the Robots
find his planet in the future? Would they attack it like the Humans did.
Loth'Raks decided he needed to travel to Earth and meet with the Robots. He needed to know their plans. They had started exploring the Universe and it
wouldn't be long till they discovered his planet.
Loth'Rak walked up the launching dock. The army had prepared his transport already. He was traveling alone. The black hole had appeared in his galexy that
his ship will travel through. The blackhole will take him to Earth where he will meet with the Human race. His race had been attempting to create a cure for
the side effect of experiencing multiply timnelines. Ever since Loth'Rak started sending people back. His head from the visions. They had been getting stronger.
On Loth'Raks home world he had been expericening regular visions of a world that had been bombed. There was no life there - only Loth'Rak. Launching in 10, 9,
8... Loth'Rak was strapped in and ready to leave. The ship that was carrying him was set to travel straight through the blackhole. The alien technology had been
developed so that the travel through a black hole only taking several hundrad Earth years. Loth'Raks ship approched the blackhole. This was the first time he had
traveled through one and he had heard from other travelers that the best thing to do was close your eyes and hold your breath. He watched out the front window
as his ship hit the blackhole he closed his eyes and held his breath.
When Loth'Rak openeds his eyes a giant blue planet. He let the breath out. There it was everything he had heard about in stories and books - Earth. The ship
traveled towards the Earth, entering it atmosphone. Loth'Rak looked out the side window - the Earths Moon, in a full and complete. He held his forehead as the
visions happened again. The Earths Moon appeared to be blown up, seprated into parts. The visions of the two timelines combined. There was a transparency between
the full complete moon and the shattered destoried Moon. Loth'Rak looked back at the Earth. It too had a transparency. Giant robotic cities compard to the Human
cities. Loth'Rak injected himself with the needle. This was the cure for the visions. His head felt calm. His ship tore through the Earths atmophure. His landing
cords were Washington DC where the President is giving a speech. The story is told from two timeline periods. In both timelines ai machines are created. These are
sent to the Earths Moon. One of the ai is cracked by Antony - a half alien, half human creature stuck on Mars.</p>
<p>The attack happened just like before. The robotic president and Detective got into the vechile and the car comes under attack from hostiles. The President was
destoried in the attack. A robotic version of Detective is sent back to save a robotic version of Joey. The robotic version of Sarah holds her teddy bear and
watched the speech on television.</p>

<p>Sarah had finished her breakfast and loaded the dishes into the dishwasher. It was almost time for her training. She proceeded ro the training room.
Outside the training room was her astronauts suit. She picked and and changed into it. It fitted perfectly. Now that her suit was on she could move
into the training area. She pressed the large green button and the sliding doors opened. They closed after her. Another set of doors opened in front
of her. She could hear a hissing sound and felt a change in gravity. Her body was lifted from the ground. The gravity simulator of the moon had
started. Sarah had experienced these gravity sims before but this one felt so much real. She floated forward towards the open door - using the
hand grips on the wall to boost herself forward. She made and to the open door and pushed her way through. Once inside this door it closed behind
her. The scene had changed. No longer was she inside but now outside - on the Moon. She looked around to get a sense of direction.
The soil was gray. She gave it a kick and dust blew up. In the distance she could see her transport pod. She started to head towards it.</p>
<p>Joey jumped to the left as the ray gun blast barely missed him. The alien creature below had opened fire on him. It was definitely not human. It had
pale blue skin completion. It had four arm, two which was wielding the ray gun. It's face, torso and legs looked quite human. 'Perhaps it was mix',
thought Joey. Another blast sounded and Joey turned around and started to run. He wasn't sure if he would be so lucky at dodging these blasts next
time. The alien creature started running towards him at great speed. The alien turned around and yelled at the figure standing
behind him. It shrieked in a language that Joey had never heard, it sounded like nothing of the languages of Earth. The figure behind the alien
creature looked completely different. It was a humanoid figure and mechanical. It took large strides as it ran to catch up with the alien. It's legs
clanked together as it ran. Joey looked back as he was running. The alien creature was gaining on him. Joey tripped and started to tumble down the
sandy dune. He continued to roll. The alien would almost be at the top of the dune by now and would have a clear shot of Joey. Just as the alien
reached the peak of the dune - Joey blacks out, his body fading away.</p>
<p>Joey awoke in a pitch black room. He was lying down on his back. He moved his head to the left and right. His arms moved. He reached into his
pocket. The red USB was gone that contained the corrupt private key. As Joey sat up the single light flickered on. 'Motion detection lighting', Joey
spoke to himself. He recognized the room. It was the same room he had been in with Sarah. Uganka had lead the two into this room and then he had
blacked out. 'Where had he been?', he thought to himself. His thoughts were cloudy. He could remember coming into the room and the red and purple
lasers, the shrieking sounds that almost burst his hearing. He was alone. Sarah and Uganka were not in the room. 'Where could Sarah be', he thought.
He stood up. Standing he had a flash of a vision. It was of a red sandy planet. It was hazily but he could picture some figures. He couldn't
recognize them though. The visions faded - bringing him back to the room. They didn't fade completely - there was a transparency in the room. Like
two worlds combined. He kicked the ground. Sand flew up. It was like he was stuck between two worlds.
The single light bulb stick flickered but the room seemed brighter from the red sun shining. He started to walk towards the exit door. He remembered
entering here with Sarah. Uganka didn't enter - he stayed outside. Joey stood in front of the large metal door. Bringing his arm up he started to
turn the handle. A loud shrieking sound from the other side of the door caused him to let go of the handle and jump back. 'Was someone on the other
side', he thought to himself. 'Perhaps it is just these visions of another world'. Not only was he getting visions of this red planet - but he was
hearing sounds from it also. He reached for the handle again - turning it slowly and opening the door slightly - it was dark but nobody was there.
Joey opened the door further and stepped through. The lights flicked on. It was a long hallway. He started to make his way forward - towards the exit
of the building.
The sound of a ray gun blast hurt his ears. He brought his arms up and covered his ears moving forward. He wanted to get out of the building. He
wanted the sounds and visions to stop.
Joey burst through the doors. Outside on the street the visions finally stopped. He was relieved. Finally some peace. He prayed that they wouldn't
come back. Whatever happened to him, he wanted to find out. Outside it was dark and raining. Was it still the same night that he had arrived here
with Sarah? It felt like he had been gone a long time. He looked around for a newspaper that might have today's date. A bin. He spotted it and walked
towards it. Reaching inside he pulled out the paper. It was todays date, it was still the same day that himself and Sarah had entered the room.
Joey decided to retrace his steps from earlier that evening. He can remember well walking to this building from another. He started walking down the
road. As he was about to reach the corner a cat-like creature sprinted across the road. Frightened Joey jumped back. The cat-creature didn't seem
to notice him. Was it the visions again? He crept closer. The creature had stopped running and was licking some food waste from the ground. Joey
approached it vocationally. The creature spotted Joey and let out a hiss which sounds very similar to the shrieking sound behind the door from
earlier.</p>
<p>ArtControl machines swept the world. They
were in every school, workplace and home
across the world. They were tasked with
making the lives of humans better.
The machines were originally developed
by the company TechFuncMasters but the
blueprints and source code was open
source, so other companies jumped
in and created their own machines.
The machines were originally developed to
mimic artists, but they were developed
to so much more. They were made to
develop with their human hosts. What their
human hosts experienced - they also
experienced.</p>
<p>The humans got greedy though. They learn
of a race more supiour than theirs. They
wanted to use the alien tech against the
aliens.
The Humans had found a ray gun weapon
that was developed into a larger weapon.</p>
