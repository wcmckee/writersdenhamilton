He had just enough to give Detective an injection when he awoke.
once there live a man who lived in a big house
hr had everything he wanted in that house. To tell you the gftruth that house was in fact
not a house but it was a spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa had located Antonys ship. She didn't want to get too close to hi sship or
he might notice her. She decided to
exit her spaceship and travel through space towards his ship - getting a
good inside - and maybe even entering the shiop. She had left her ship out of the rador of his ship. If he was scanning then her ship would
be detected. Vanessa stepped into the suit. It had been specially designed to have boosters elements so that she is able to travel in the space
quickly for a short period of time. The booster wasn't able to be detected from the ships rador and Vanessa was able to grab onto Antonys ship
and view through the windows on what was happenig. Vanessa peaked through the window. She could see Detective straped to a chair. His arms and
legs were tied down with leather straps. Detective was sitting in a seat accross from him - drinking a cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blah blah blah said Antony. Waiting for Detective to wakeup
felt like a lifetime. He brewed him many cups of coffee and played endless video games well waiting. There was nothing to do except to wait.
Antony often wondered what Detective would be doing at that point. He had no idea where Detective would be or what time. There was a chance
that he could experience multi timelines on his travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His head hurt. The pain shot through his left side of the brain. He wanted to movevv, to get up. Stand up.
Move. He was straped down.  The leather straps overing his wrists and angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective found and captured Antony at a technolgy conference. It is the same conference Joey and Vanessa meet in. When Detective gets sent back
from the spaceship he travels to a range of different times and chances many events.

helping to promote Creative Commons in
the Hamilton area and through organisions
he is involved with - artcontrol, Writers
Den Hamilton, Hamilton Computer Club,
Hamilton Library. Everything he creates
is licenced under a Creative Commons license,
with preference for the more libral, and
open culture licences - CC BY and CC BY-SA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His art can be found at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://artcontrol.me/"&gt;http://artcontrol.me/&lt;/a&gt; and is
available under a Creative Commons
Attribution (BY) licence.
William is a supporter, user, and developer of
open source software and hardware. He is passionate
about early childhood education having volunteered for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Creative Commons is useful to an artist to promote
the work and it makes the world a better place," says
William. "Others may find uses for my art
and even make money from it, good on them!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During High School William spent the majority
of his senior years in the Design room. Spenting the majority of his time creating vector
designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William became interested in
drawing after leaving high school and
attending UCOL in Palmerston North.
There he had a drawing tutor, Mark,
who inspired him to keep a drawing journal.
William gained the habit of carrying a
sketchbook wherever
he goes, along with a pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William created the site artcontrol.me:
The Art Of William Mckee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site was created for a home for William
to host his artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally powered by WordPress, he has since
switched to the Python static website
generator - Nikola. This powers his various sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hosted with GoDaddy and ran CentOS. The site was powered by WordPress,
switching later to Nikola.
He later also switched this to DigitalOcean
with the operating system Debian, which is
used by the majority of his machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well William was always interested in using
a Creative Commons licence, he at first
chose to use a more restrictive
Attribution-NonCommercial (BY-NC) licence
for his artworks, though soon chose to use
the liberal Attribution (BY) licence.
William doesn't see many reasons for artists
to use NC licences, and finds it especially
problematic when NC licensing is used by
governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As William argues, "Tax payers have already
paid for the material. It should therefore be licensed under the most liberal licences
(perhaps even public domain/creativecommons
zero). This allows the most freedom for
people to do what they like with the content."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of aribution. Everyone should be
licencing their copyright work under a Create Commons Attribution licence or
zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William also point out that the
"Non-Commercial licences are hard to
interpret, as was noted in a German court
case in 2014, which strongly limited the
interpretation of NC to 'personal use.'
Similar problems with the interpretation
of NC could exist in other countries.
This is why I think everyone should avoid
the NC licence. I would actually prefer that
the NC licence not exist in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing, Williams says, is that the
majority of New Zealand government works
released under CC seems to be under CC BY,
though he is concerned that some schools
seem to have adopted an NC licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended
The Learning Connexion, where he began to
focus on life drawing. This was created on
brown paper with an easel. Pencil, coloured
pencil, oil pastel, acrylic paint, gouche,
watercolours were the media that he used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William had done digital painting since
attending UCOL with illustration classes.
He used a Wacon tablet. Currently for his
digital painting William uses an Intous 5
small tablet connected to a Raspberry Pi
computer. The software he uses is GIMP 2.8
and it is running the operating system
Rasbian (Debian Jessie, Stable). William uses
a batery pack plugged into the Pi to power it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William uses the Pi to edit text. Plugging
in a keyboard and uses terminal with the
softwarenano to edit text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digial later focused on portraits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;using GIMP, an free and open source
raster graphics software. William began by
painting on a windows desktop and laptop,
later switching to Fedora and Debian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait
and figures were drawn from references on
RedditGetsDrawn. During this period,
William would draw portraits of people and
give them the drawing - taking a photo for
his own reference.
At the bottom of the page he would sign
with wcmckee artcontrol.me and write 'cc by'
on the piece of original artwork.
These were mostly completely in pencil
and coloured pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William is also passionate about working
with children. In 2014 he volunteered at
Whaihanga Early Learning Centre,
where he would work collaboratively with
kids, often on the same piece of art,
using oil pastel, pencil, and coloured
pencil.
He was influenced by the children's artwork
- often redrawing elements of their works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William took the liberty of licensing these
works under a CC BY licence - photographing
and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me.
He would create large chalk murals on the
ground outside, with children requested that
he draw comic book characters like the Hulk,
Spiderman, Bane, and Batman. These mural
pieces were created on the fenceline of
Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School.
Swarms of school children would crowd the
fenceline - watching and discussing the
artwork with him. They were blown away
from how quickly he worked and the
quality of his artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A hope of mine," William says,
"was the children would learn that art was
about sharing and remixing - something
Creative Commons has at its core."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William has since become a volunteer for
Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand,
helping to spread the word about
Creative Commons licensing in
the Hamilton region.
If you want to volunteer, get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

relatively small and citizens were able to engage face-to-face or via handwritten
messages in their deliberation and decision-making process. As populations grew larger participation in a democracy required mediation,
i.e. communication is now mediated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest mass media was the newspaper, followed by the radio and television, and today, the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of its emerging function as a watchdog that monitors the running of the nation by exposing excesses and corruption, and holding those in power accountable, the media was regarded as the fourth estate,
supplementing the three branches of government by providing checks and balances. The media also plays a more basic role as a provider of
information necessary for rational debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/public-mediastudies.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2015 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title></title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanomiddle.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;NaNoWriMo Young Writers Program

&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all about motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pep talks and bribery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;jumping up and down with excitement at the
first mention of National Novel Writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don’t expect everyone to
embrace NaNoWriMo as more than a grade right
off the bat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect amazing things. If you take a whole
class and soak them in creativity
for a month, something is going to happen.
It might not be exactly what you expected,
but it’s going to be awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you make it all happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the steps in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Does NaNoWriMo Work for Educators?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;check out all the resources we provide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use the following lessons however you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though writing is done in
in November, you should begin
working in October to be sure your kids are
fully prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common Core Fulfillments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Young Writers Program believes that
NaNoWriMo, in addition to being totally fun,
can easily fit into a rigorous course of
study. In 2009, we adapted all of our
lessons to California’s state English
Language Arts standards. The response to
this development was great: more teachers
were able to incorporate the program, and
more administrators were able to see how
effective it can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the YWP again adapted its materials,
this time to the new national Common Core
Standards. Adopted by 42 states, the
District of Columbia, and four territories,
the Common Core provides clear, effective
touchstones for English content learning.
We like that it can be used and understood
by our educators across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top of each lesson,
you will find a list of the standards that
the lesson fulfills. You can also download
a detailed chart of the Common Core
fulfillments for the entire curriculum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering Assessment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Young Writers Program knows that all
educators have existing assessment systems,
and it may be a challenge to figure out how
NaNoWriMo fits in. The good news is that,
throughout the years, teachers have devised
many different strategies for assessing
students’ work during November and beyond.
Here are a few suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with students to create realistic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;tt class="docutils"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, line 143)&lt;/p&gt;
Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;word-count goals. People will be starting
the program at many different levels,
and you should individualize accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide—and make clear to your class—early&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;tt class="docutils"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, line 149)&lt;/p&gt;
Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on exactly how students will be accountable
for their novels. You might require them to
regularly submit excerpts or plot summaries,
or keep their word count updated on the
classroom progress poster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarify exactly what you expect the final&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;tt class="docutils"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, line 157)&lt;/p&gt;
Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;product to look like. One of the founding
philosophies of NaNoWriMo is that quantity
is more important than quality. That said,
students should be expected to do some
editing work to align their work with
writing conventions and Common Core
Standards. Consider whether you want them
to revise an excerpt, their whole novel,
or something in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don’t necessarily advise trying to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;tt class="docutils"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, line 169)&lt;/p&gt;
Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;read all of your students’ novels. If you
regularly collect excerpts and summaries,
you should have a good sense of what kids
are working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base grading on effort as well as product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;tt class="docutils"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, line 176)&lt;/p&gt;
Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project will be challenging for many
students, and you should reward their hard
work even if they don’t ultimately reach
their word-count goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have created a suggested rubric that you
can use to assess students’ work. It is
based on the content of our curriculum and
young novelist workbooks, and contains
categories for characters, plot, setting,
dialogue, voice, and conventions. You should
feel free to modify it to fit your
classroom’s needs. (Students might also use
it for self-assessment of their novels.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 1: Introducing NaNoWriMo and
Getting Rid of Inner Editors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT
(students will be able to):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the NaNoWriMo project and its basic mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write for a short time frame explaining their definitions of creativity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put aside their impulses to edit their writing until after November 30.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit to maintaining a safe and respectful writing space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"KWL" (Know, Want to Know, Learned) chart on board, transparency, or flipchart paper; explained in Step One.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A list of important NaNoWriMo facts on the board, transparency, or flipchart paper; explained in Step Two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An "Inner Editor: Help and Hinder" chart on the board, transparency, or flipchart paper; explained in Step Three.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"In-class and Written Respect Expectations" on the board, transparency, or flipchart paper; explained in Step Four.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: Writing Prompt                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write this question on the board: What does it mean to be creative? Give students 5 minutes to write a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: What Is NaNoWriMo, Anyway?                15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a "KWL" (Know, Want to Know, Learned) chart. Ask students what they already “Know” about this project, starting with what NaNoWriMo stands for. After about 3 minutes in that column, move to the “Want to Know” column and take student questions and concerns. Answer logistical questions immediately, and highlight questions that today’s lesson will cover, namely those about being creative and what expectations are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure students are clear about the following things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They will learn about a new element of novel/fiction writing each class period (depending on how you space the lessons out/how much time you have).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They will plan a whole novel in class in small groups, and plan their own at home as homework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They may not officially start writing the novel until November 1, and must stop on November 30.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can set their own word-count goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantity is better than quality until editing begins in December.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not fill in the “Learned” column yet. Come back to this at the end of class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Setting Aside Your Inner Editor                15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remind students of how hard it was for them to write about the meaning of creativity. Ask for a show of hands for the following three questions: “Who had trouble thinking of the right words? Who ended up erasing something because it didn’t seem good enough? Who just went with the first thing that came to mind?” Let the students who raised hands for the first couple of questions know that the culprit of their uncertainty and self-doubt was their inner editor, something that those who raised their hands for the last question really know how to ignore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask students what they think you mean by an inner editor. What else might the inner editor say? After getting responses, make it clear that in most cases, they need the inner editor. Make a chart for how the inner editor could help or hinder them. First ask students to name situations where they need to think things through and make sure they are writing the right thing. Now make a list for when the inner editor doesn’t help. It shouldn’t be very long. The point is that this class will be special because for the month when they are actually writing (what are those dates again, class?) they should completely ignore that little voice in them. Ask the class why they think this is so. Go through the list of facts from before and note that the inner editor wants them to write fewer and better words, but NaNoWriMo is telling them to go ahead and write more words, and to make them better later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, establish some behaviors that count as editing (examples: thinking for more than 5 minutes about what to write, erasing more than three words) and how your students can deal with them (deep breaths, eenie-meenie-miney-mo between word or plot options, picking something from an inspirational grab bag and incorporating it into their stories). These should be specific to your class, and are not rules but tools to help students resist the urge to edit. In class during November, tell them you will have things on hand like that grab bag, inspirational books to read, and whatever else you think will help. Urge students to always go with the first thing they think of, and never think anything is too weird or bad. If it is, they can fix it later. How nice is that?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Four: Discussion on Respect                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel it’s appropriate for your class, you may also want to discuss respect. You can say that getting rid of your inner editor does not equal being disrespectful to others in the class. Remind the class that everyone deserves the space to be creative. So what does that mean? Discuss respect in the classroom and in writing. Post your “In-Class and Written Respect Expectations” visual aid, or refer to ones you already have as a class that are not to be broken. Specific examples of respect in writing may include not making fun of someone in writing, not making a classmate a mean or bad character, and not using offensive language. Offer students the chance to add to the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Five: What Have We Learned?                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now fill in the “Learned” column of your chart about NaNoWriMo, the inner editor, and rules of respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;

1. Describe the characteristics and purpose of the novel form.
2. Identify key characteristics of a chosen novel, including point of view.
3. Write and deliver an oral presentation about a chosen novel, describing its characters and important events with appropriate eye contact, volume, and pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* Each student should bring in a copy of a book that he or she really likes. Instruct them about this ahead of time. Explain that this book should be at least 100 pages long and should tell a made-up story. Students may select books that have been read in class, if desired.
* One clean copy of the “What Makes a Novel a Novel?” worksheet per student. This can also be found on page 4 of the Young Novelist Workbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: What Makes a Novel?                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell students that in order to write their own novels, they first have to understand what a novel actually is! Ask students if they have any ideas about this so far. Then write the following definition, from the “What Makes a Novel a Novel?” worksheet, on the board or chart paper; alternately, you may dictate as a volunteer writes for you:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel is a long book that tells a story of made-up characters and events. It is written in prose and contains a conflict, or main problem, that the characters try to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask students to name as many novels as they can that they have read for school or know about otherwise. For example, novels that have been made into movies (such as the Harry Potter novels). See how long of a list you can make as a group!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: Model Novels                15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next have students take out the books they brought into class, their “favorite novels.” Ask, “Did any of you bring in books that are not novels? How do you know?” Tell any students who brought in books that are not novels that they can complete the day’s worksheet and activities using one of the novels read in school. Pass out the "What Makes a Novel a Novel?" worksheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have students skim the first page of the worksheet and fill in the bottom with the names of the novels they chose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then ask them to turn to the second page and work independently to fill in the blanks with details about their chosen novels. If students are unfamiliar with the concept of “perspective” as discussed in item 4, read the worksheet definitions aloud and help them identify familiar examples of each type. Also, if students are sharing copies of novels read in class, they may wish to quietly discuss answers to the questions with classmates that are using the same book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Book Talk                25 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say, “Now that you have filled in the worksheet page with information about your model novel, you’re almost ready to present your novel to the class!” Read aloud the sample book talk on the third page of the worksheet:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you think you’re tired right now. But you don't know what tired is until you have a baby. The main character of The First Part Last, by Angela Johnson, is so tired he wonders how little sleep he can get without dropping dead. Instead of sleeping at night, when the baby is crying, Bobby sleeps everywhere else: in line at the grocery store buying formula, on the bus, even at school. His teachers feel sorry for him since they know what’s happening at his house, but that doesn’t mean they won’t fail him if they have to. Sure, when Bobby's beautiful, smart girlfriend Nia got pregnant, he decided to do whatever it took to be a great dad. But he never imagined that he'd have to do it all alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell students that they will have 20 minutes to prepare their book talks. Say, “Your book talks do not have to be perfect or include tons of detail; it is fine for the talk to be four or five sentences long. The important thing is that you introduce your classmates to the book’s main characters and possibly his or her problem, and get them to want to read that book! You want to emphasize those qualities that make your books unique or exciting—basically, all the reasons why you love your novels.” Have students start writing their book talks based on the information in their worksheets. If any students finish writing early, have them practice reading their books talks aloud quietly with clear pronunciation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Five: Share                15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give each student a chance to present his or her book talk to the group. (Break them into smaller groups if needed for this task, depending on how many students you are working with.) Remind students to speak clearly as they give their talks, using eye contact, adequate volume, and clear pronunciation to convey their excitement about the books they chose. As each student finishes, make sure to clap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell students to bring their “What Makes a Novel a Novel?” worksheets with them to class each day, along with copies of their chosen novels if possible, to refer back to as they outline and write their own novels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have students study their model novels as much as they can to find writing methods that they’d consider using in their own writing. Writing methods can include anything from using a lot of sensory details to adding multiple plot twists or creating an entire fantasy world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 3: Good Book, Bad Book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Speaking and Listening: 1a. Initiate and engage actively in group discussions on grade 6 topics, texts, and issues being studied in class; prepare for discussions by completing reading or conducting research and explicitly draw on that material in discussions.
* Grade 7: Speaking and Listening: 1a. Initiate and engage actively in group discussions on grade 7 topics, texts, and issues being studied in class; prepare for discussions by completing reading or conducting research and explicitly draw on that material in discussions.
* Grade 8: Speaking and Listening: 1a. Initiate and engage actively in group discussions on grade 8 topics, texts, and issues being studied in class; prepare for discussions by completing reading or conducting research and explicitly draw on that material in discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson Time: 55 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT:
1. Identify what they think are aspects of good and bad novels.
2. Prepare for and engage in a group discussion about books they have read and the qualities of these books they found most effective (“good”) and least effective (“bad”).
3. Identify which of those good aspects they want to incorporate into their own novels, and which of those bad aspects they want to avoid writing into their novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* Markers in multiple colors; one for every four students in your class.
* Good Book/Bad Book visual aids. These are two pieces of butcher paper/oversized Post-it notes, one that says “Why this book is good” and the other that says “Why this book is bad.”
* "Last Group Standing Grid" visual aid; see example in Step Four.
* Scrap paper; two pieces per group of three or four students.
* A copy of the "Good Book, Bad Book" worksheet for each student. This can also be found on page 8 of the Young Novelist Workbook.
* Prizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: Good Books                20 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask students to open their workbooks to page 8 to the "Good Book, Bad Book" worksheet, or hand them out if you've made copies. Give students a few minutes to fill out the first part of worksheet with their favorite books. Either limit their pool to books they’ve read for school, or let the list encompass any book they’ve read. If you have any of the books students have read for school on hand, encourage students to flip through them to refresh their memories; this will be especially useful for any students who get “stuck” in this exercise. Also remind them that they may refer to the books that they chose as “model novels” in Lesson 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After time is up, call on three people to share their books, but warn them that they will be asked to explain why they liked them. Reveal the “Good Book/Bad Book” visual and record their responses. Encourage students to explain, for example, what made them feel that the characters in their novels were interesting or likable, and what made the plots of their novels “work,” as opposed to seeming like a stretch. Probe them to cite specific examples whenever possible. (Example: If a student initially says “I thought the book was funny,” ask questions to help them develop into a more specific answer such as “Max, the main character, talked about funny things like wedgies a lot, and I definitely know people like that.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then ask all students to get into groups of three or four (select randomly or let them select, according to group dynamics). Number each group 1–? then, using their favorite books as inspiration, give students 5–10 minutes to write down (as a group) as many things as possible that make books good on a blank piece of paper (not worksheet), with their group number on it. Continue to encourage students to be as creative as possible because there will be a game using this list in a few minutes. Post a list of forbidden phrases/words like "it's good," "not boring," "it's funny," "it's sad," etc. Ask students to really describe these books. Post a list of more descriptive words and phrases too such as “believable characters,” “sarcastic dialogue,” “felt like I was there.” Tell students to keep their lists a secret. Collect the sheets immediately to avoid students tampering with them until later. Transitions must be quick in order to get to the game, so let students know that messing around equals not playing the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Bad Books                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask students to stay with their groups, but to take 2 minutes to individually think of three books that totally stink and write them down on the "Bad Book" section of the worksheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using their least favorite books as inspiration, give students 5–10 minutes with their group to write down as many things as they can think of that make their least favorite books boring and painful to read on a blank piece of paper (not worksheet), with their group number on it. After the time is up, collect the "Bad Book" lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Four: Last Group Standing                15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reveal a grid on the board like so:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you have one marker color per group, or another system of keeping track of group additions to the game. Have students stand up and make sure all pens/pencils/markers, etc. are put away so that no additions can be made to the lists you are about to hand back. Hand back the "Good Book/Bad Book" lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here is how the game is played:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For 3 minutes, groups must offer up one new reason at a time to go on the “What makes a book good?” list in the hopes of becoming the team with the most additions to the list at the end of that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To give groups an equal opportunity to answer, call on them in order like this: Team 1, 2, and so on until the highest numbered team goes; then go backwards back down to team one so that even though team 4 had to go last, they get to go twice in a row. Repeat this so that no one can complain that it’s “not fair.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Team X adds something that is also on Team Y’s list, Team Y must cross it off their list and they cannot add it to the list. There are no repeats allowed. The trick here is that if teams came up with unique and original reasons why books are good, they should rarely have to cross things off their list that have already been said. If a team eventually does cross everything off, they are out of the game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paraphrase as you write their ideas down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teams should compete until time is up or until only one group still has reasons to add to the board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the "Bad Book" section, repeat the above. Reassign team numbers so that the middle teams are now the first and last groups and the first and last groups are now in the middle. Give out prizes to the teams with the most original ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Five: Closing/Homework                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell students to make their own list of book qualities at home for homework. About 5 minutes ought to remain in the lesson for students to begin. This is the only lesson plan where time is budgeted for beginning the homework, or for letting a class game go long because it may spark interesting discussions of what novels should be. Hopefully this will set an inspirational tune for the rest of the curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 4: Creating Awesome Characters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Writing: 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, event sequence, characters) using relevant sensory details.
* Grade 7: Writing: 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, conflict, complex characters) with relevant and specific sensory details.
* Grade 8: Writing: 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, plot, event sequence, complex characters) with well-chosen, relevant, and specific sensory details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson Time: 50 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT:
1. Analyze characters and their thoughts, words, and actions in a novel.
2. Begin developing complex major and minor characters for their group novels.
3. Practice teamwork in creating a novel in a group.
4. Develop complex major and minor characters for their own novels as homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* Copies of the "Creating Interesting Characters" worksheet and "Character Questionnaire"; one per student, and extras for your groups of four. This worksheet can also be found on page 11 of the Young Novelists Workbook.
* Two pieces of scrap paper per student.
* Equal numbers of stickers in four colors, so there is enough for one sticker per student.
* "Role Rules" visual aid; explained in step three&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: Characters You Have Loved or Hated                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have students recall characters that have really stood out in books they have read. Ask for a brief character sketch for any character they contribute. If necessary, have students recall the characters from their "model novel" from Lesson 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get discussion going, ask the following: “Which characters do you love to love? Which characters do you love to hate? Why do these characters stick out in your mind? How are they alike and different? Have any of them faced similar conflicts? Did they think, act, and do things that you could relate to or were they much different from you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say, “Last week we discussed what makes a book a page-turner and what makes one a good paper weight. Part of what makes a book fun to read are good characters. We don’t have to like all of them, we don’t have to hate all of them, but we have to be interested in them to bother reading. Today we’re going to learn what kinds of characters make up a basic story, and how to make them interesting.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: Who Makes the Story?                15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask students to turn to page 11 of their NaNoWriMo Young Novelist workbooks, or hand copies of the "Creating Awesome Characters" worksheet out, one to each student. As a class, read through the descriptions of each type of character on the worksheet, having students take turns reading aloud. After a student reads a character description, ask someone to name examples of that character-type from books the class has read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check for understanding by asking students to close their workbooks and turn over their worksheets and alternately ask students to tell you the type of character someone that you name is. Or you can have them name the type of a character whose name you call out from a book read in class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Who Makes a Story Interesting                20 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide students up into groups of four, either randomly or by letting students select for themselves. Hand each group four colored stickers, each a different color, and ask each student to choose a color randomly. After students have chosen their color, they must place the sticker on their forehead/hand/shirt. Then tell them that red = protagonist, blue = antagonist, green = supporting character #1, yellow = supporting character #2. If there is a lot of grumbling, give students exactly 30 seconds to switch roles. Reveal the "Role Rules" visual aid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Role Rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your role, you:
1. Get final approval of aspects of your character.
2. Will speak about your character to the class.
3. Will at least read the dialogue of your character aloud to the class in coming lessons, if not more parts of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell students that they will plan out a novel in these groups until NaNoWriMo begins, and will have the chance to discuss their plans and read short excerpts to the class every week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearly state: “These stories will be different from your individual NaNo-novels, but they may serve as inspiration. So if your NaNo-protagonist has a radioactive mole on his left check and so does your group novel's protagonist, that’s okay as long as they are not the exact same character.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have students discuss their ideas for a protagonist, antagonist, and two supporting characters in their groups until they have decided upon characters that make sense as a unit. Tell students to keep in mind that they will be developing a conflict for their characters to face. While they discuss, hand out an extra copy of the "Character Questionnaire," four per group along with some scrap paper. Tell students that, after the group has created characters together, they can each start answering the questions for the character they represent individually using the character questionnaire. Remind students of Role Rule #1, but encourage them to keep talking to each other so that their characters make sense as a group. If not much time remains, tell students to answer five questions that you have previously selected before class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 4: Group Progress Report                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask groups to share their characters. If students are still shy at this point, pose some discussion questions such as: “Does a reader have to like the protagonist or just understand him/her in order to like a book? Should characters be perfectly good or bad? If you liked a character from another book, should you make yours just like that character?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homework for this lesson should be filling out a character questionnaire for their own novel's protagonist, one supporting character, and antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 5: Creating Conflict&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Writing: 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, event sequence, characters) using relevant sensory details.
* Grade 7: Writing: 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, conflict, complex characters) with relevant and specific sensory details.
* Grade 8: Writing: 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, plot, event sequence, complex characters) with well-chosen, relevant, and specific sensory details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson Time: 50 Minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT:
1. Understand and identify characters’ internal conflicts as well as external conflicts in a novel.
2. Develop internal and external conflicts for characters in their group novels and in their own individual novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* "Conflict Definition" visual aid with definitions of internal and external conflict written out on the board or on a transparency; explained in Step Two.
* A copy of the "Creating Conflict" worksheet for each student. This can also be found on page 16 of the Young Novelist Workbook.
* Extra copies of the "Creating Conflict" worksheet; one per four-student group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: Let’s Talk About Game Shows!                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask students to name some great game shows. Pose this question: "What makes a game show fun to watch?" Ask how they would feel about these shows if there were no real challenges for contestants to overcome in order to win? Boring, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say, “The obstacles in a game show are like the obstacles that the protagonist faces in a book. If the protagonist just has everything go his/her/its way no matter what, that's boring. It’s boring even if you have incredible characters like the ones you created for your group novels and on your own last night. If your characters are as real and interesting as I think they are, they are bound to have at least a few problems in life just like we do in the real world. Today we are going to talk about setting up the obstacles in your novels. This is called creating conflict.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: The Two Faces of Conflict                15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand out copies of the "Creating Conflict" worksheet to each student. Call on students to read the worksheet aloud. Pause after each section to check for understanding by asking questions about the external and internal conflict in a book the class recently read. Students can also refer to their "model novel" if they so choose. If students have trouble identifying types of conflict, give them a few examples, and provide students with some guidelines to differentiate between internal and external conflict on visuals in front of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visual could say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“External Conflict: What the protagonist wants vs. what the antagonist wants.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Internal Conflict: What the protagonist wants vs. the protagonist's fears and/or weaknesses.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Conflict DOES NOT = your best fight scene.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Group Noveling                15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have students get into their small noveling groups. As they do so, hand out extra copies of the "Creating Conflict" worksheet, one per group. Make it clear that all four students must come up with the basic conflict for their group novel together, even though this exercise may not include all four characters. Give them 10 minutes to create the two kinds of conflict previously discussed. Tell students that they should include sensory details about the conflict where they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Four: Progress Report!                15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call for pencils and pens down and eyes and ears on you. Ask groups to volunteer to describe their characters and their conflict. Discuss whether what the groups came up with counts as external and/or internal conflict and why. Invite students from all groups to comment in a positive and encouraging way. Make sure students understand both kinds of conflict before tackling this worksheet for their own novels as homework. Remind students once again that their individual novels should be different from the ones they create in their noveling groups, but they can use their group novel as inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have students complete the "Creating Conflict" worksheet for their own novels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let your kids know that they will need to bring Book X to class. Choose a book that you have already read as a class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 6: Elements of Plot – Part One&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Literature: 3. Describe how a story’s plot unfolds (in a series of episodes         or as a problem to be solved) as well as how characters adapt or change as they move toward a resolution. Writing: 3a. Write narratives in which they engage and orient the reader by establishing a context and point of view, and organize a sequence of events or experiences; 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, event sequence, characters) using relevant sensory details; 4. Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.
* Grade 7: Literature: 3. Analyze how particular lines of dialogue or specific incidents in a story or drama propel the action, reveal aspects of a character, or provoke a decision. Writing: 3a. Write narratives in which they engage and orient the reader by establishing a context and point of view, and purposefully organize a sequence of events or experiences; 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, conflict, complex characters) with relevant and specific sensory details; 4. Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.
* Grade 8: Literature: 3. Analyze how elements of a story or drama interact (e.g., how plot and setting are integral to one another; how the setting affects characters). Writing: 3a. Write narratives in which they engage and orient the reader by establishing a context and point of view, and purposefully organize a progression of events or experiences; 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, plot, event sequence, complex characters) with well-chosen, relevant, and specific sensory details; 4. Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson Time: 60 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT:
1. Describe the plot of a known novel including events in the beginning, conflict, and rising action, and explain how some of these events propel the plot of the novel forward.
2. Establish and develop a sequence of events leading to a plot for their group novels and then for their own novels as homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* Transparency/slide projected image of an actual rollercoaster.
* Transparency of the blank "Plot Rollercoaster."
* The chosen Book X that your class read together with tabs on the significant events in the book that correspond to those on the "Plot Rollercoaster." Be prepared to read passages from those parts.
* An "Outlining Your Plot" worksheet for each student. This can also be found on page 20 of the Young Novelist Workbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: The Fun of Rollercoasters                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell the class that today’s lesson is so huge that we have to start with something really serious. Project or post a picture of a rollercoaster. Say, “I need to know what you all like about rollercoasters.” After you take some responses, complicate the issue with these questions: “Would it be as fun if all the dips were the same? What if the biggest fall came at the beginning? What if there were no dips and it was just a straight line? What does this have to do with novels?” Gather more responses. Students will probably gather that a good novel is like a good rollercoaster. So say, “You have already figured out the central conflict of your novel, now you have to figure out specific actions that will happen to resolve it, and that will look like a big hill on a rollercoaster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: Plotting the Plot Rollercoaster                25 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hand out copies of the "Outlining Your Plot" worksheets, one per student. Explain to students that the “plot” of a novel is what the novel is all about, or the sequence of important events as they occur. (You may wish to point out that the order in which plot events occur is not necessarily the same order in which an author reveals important plot events to the reader.) Then call on students to read the descriptions of set-up (beginning), the inciting incident (which usually introduces a story's main conflicts), and rising action only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask students to get out their copies of the last novel you read as a class. Project the "Plot Rollercoaster" transparency onto the board. Discuss and analyze the sequence of events in that novel and label its elements on the "Plot Rollercoaster" transparency. For example, when discussing the set-up, ask a student what the set-up, or beginning, of Book X was. Paraphrase it on the appropriate section of the transparency. Have students read relevant passages and phrases that they pick out, with some guidance from you on page numbers if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each important event, invite students to speculate about how this event propelled the action of the story. For example, prompt discussion by asking “What does this event have to do with the main conflict of the novel? How does it move the story along?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your discussion of this book should end right before the climax, or most exciting nail-biting part of the book. Instruct them that they will know they have finished plotting for the day when the next thing to happen is the climax. Tell students this will be discussed in the next lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Group Noveling                30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have students get into their noveling groups and hand out extra copies of the "Outlining Your Plot" worksheet, one per group. Tell students they have the rest of class to work on their group plots. Why are we not reporting back today, they may ask? Answer: Because rising action will take a long time to plan. Walk around and give more counsel than usual. Since the plot may be very difficult for students to map out, it might be a good idea to hand out tokens called “Inspiration Stars” to groups writing a plot that could help others by example. When you give one out, you could ask the class to quiet down and listen as that group explains their plot. These tickets may or may not be redeemed for something. Collect the group worksheets. Remember that they will be handed out again during Step Four of the next lesson as students work out the climax and resolution of their plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For homework, students only need to outline through rising action for their own novels. Tell students that anyone who wants to get ahead should also read the worksheet descriptions of climax, falling action, and resolution at home. They might also crack open the “model novels” they chose in Lesson 2 to check out how those authors used conflict and rising action to move their plots along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 7: Elements of Plot – Part Two&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Literature: 3. Describe how a story’s plot unfolds (in a series of episodes         or as a problem to be solved) as well as how characters adapt or change as they move toward a resolution. Writing: 3a. Write narratives in which they engage and orient the reader by establishing a context and point of view, and organize a sequence of events or experiences; 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, event sequence, characters) using relevant sensory details; 3e. Provide a satisfying conclusion that follows from the events, experiences, or ideas; 4. Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.
* Grade 7: Literature: 3. Analyze how particular lines of dialogue or specific incidents in a story or drama propel the action, reveal aspects of a character, or provoke a decision. Writing: 3a. Write narratives in which they engage and orient the reader by establishing a context and point of view, and purposefully organize a sequence of events or experiences; 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, conflict, complex characters) with relevant and specific sensory details; 3e. Provide a satisfying conclusion that follows from the events, experiences, or ideas; 4. Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.
* Grade 8: Literature: 3. Analyze how elements of a story or drama interact (e.g., how plot and setting are integral to one another; how the setting affects characters).Writing: 3a. Write narratives in which they engage and orient the reader by establishing a context and point of view, and purposefully organize a progression of events or experiences; 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, plot, event sequence, complex characters) with well-chosen, relevant, and specific sensory details; 3e. Provide a satisfying conclusion that follows from the events, experiences, or ideas; 4. Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson Time: 60 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT:
1. Analyze the plot of a known novel including its climax, falling action, and resolution.
2. Establish and develop an additional sequence of events leading to plots for their group novels and, for homework, their own novels.
3. Provide satisfying conclusions for their novel plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* Spongebob Squarepants or other cartoon/TV-show clip that your students know, preferably one that includes a clear battle for the falling action. Equipment to play it on.
* Picture/text chart visual aid that describes the last three parts of the Plot Rollercoaster; this is explained in Step One.
* "Plot Rollercoaster" transparency from last time.
* Book X from the last lesson used to understand plot.
* The copies of the "Outlining Your Plot" worksheets that students worked on in groups in the last lesson, and their own individual worksheets that they worked on for homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: Spot the Plot                20 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell students they are about to watch the last few minutes of a Spongebob Squarepants cartoon. Tell them what has already happened in the episode. Ask them to spot these three moments:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The “What's going to happen next?!” moment. This is the moment right before the battle scene.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The part during which the protagonist has his/her final battle with the antagonist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The part where all the action is over and things are back to normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warn students that the battle may not be an actual fight, but it will be the part where the protagonist goes up against the antagonist to reach his or her big goal. It might help to make a visual aid representing these three things with words and pictures. The proper names of these parts should be covered; see the chart below. Students may take notes on these things on scrap paper, but do not have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask students to summarize the three parts by using examples from the cartoon. Forecast that you are about to give a proper name to those three parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: Plotting the Rest of the Plot Rollercoaster                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring back the "Plot Rollercoaster" transparency from last lesson, and keep the picture/text chart from the last activity up. Ask students to take out their individual "Plot Rollercoaster" worksheets from last time (the one for their own novel). Have the novel you discussed last time on hand for reference. Ask students to read the descriptions of the climax, falling action, and resolution from the worksheets. As you go, ask students which one of the covered-up things on the chart fits the description of what they just read and uncover them, one by one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then call on students to identify and analyze these sections in the book you are discussing and take notes on the "Plot Rollercoaster" transparency like you did in the previous lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, draw a new rollercoaster with a long and gradual incline to the climax and a swift, almost 90-degree drop with a short plateau to represent falling action and resolution, representing how these things can sometimes happen very fast, right at the end of the novel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Group Noveling                20 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask students to get into their noveling groups. Hand back the group plot worksheets. Tell students that they have around 20 minutes to write the last three parts of their plots. Some groups may still be working on their rising action. Help them to move on so they can finish their plots. Keep “Inspiration Stars” from last time handy if you decided to use them. You might want to use them to select which groups will share their plots in the next activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Four: Read Aloud!                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have as many groups as possible describe their plots. Either pre-select the sharers, make everyone share a bit, or only ask the eager groups to share. Offer a prize to those groups willing to act their entire plot out in 2 minutes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For homework, have students outline the second half of their own plots, then paraphrase their plots on the blank "Plot Rollercoaster" at the end of the worksheet. Remind them to include specific events that will take place in the climax, falling action, and resolution of their novels. Also tell them that next lesson they will be adding sensory details to their plots to create mood and setting, so they don’t have to be as concerned with the details now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 8: Setting and Mood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Writing: 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, event sequence, characters) using relevant sensory details.
* Grade 7: Writing: 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, conflict, complex characters) with relevant and specific sensory details; 3d. Choose words and phrases to develop the events, experiences, and ideas precisely and to create mood.
* Grade 8: Writing: 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, plot, event sequence, complex characters) with well-chosen, relevant, and specific sensory details; 3d. Choose words and phrases to effectively develop the events, experiences, and ideas precisely and to create mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson Time: 60 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT:
1. Understand how settings in a novel can be used to create mood.
2. Choose precise words and phrases to create mood in a story.
3. Establish and develop definite settings with mood for their group novels, then for their own as homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* Copies of the "Settings and Mood" section of the "Settings" worksheet; one for each student. This can also be found on page 31 of the Young Novelist Workbook.
* Extra copies of the "Settings with Mood" section; one per four-student group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: Settings and Mood Writing Prompt                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their journals or on a separate sheet of paper, have students choose and describe one of the following places with as much detail as possible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A place that makes you happy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A place that holds a lot of good or bad memories for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A place that scares you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: Introduce Setting and Mood                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say, “As you know, most novels have more than one setting. Usually, the author decides to have one large setting, like the town or the country and the year in which a story takes place. But there are also lots of smaller settings too, like the main character’s house late at night, or the place where the characters hang out after school. Settings serve as the backdrop to the action in a novel, but they can also add to the mood of a novel. Can someone define 'mood’ for me?” Have students come up with definitions on their own, but if theirs become too wordy, refer to the definition on the worksheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the following example from the "Settings and Mood" section of the "Settings" worksheet:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the old mansion, a one-eyed crow was picking at something on the branch of a dead tree in the yard. A three-legged dog was howling at the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask, “What kind of mood do you think this author is trying to create?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer: Creepy, suspenseful, mysterious, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invite volunteers to name settings from their favorite/"model" novels or from novels you have read in class this year. (If necessary, have them refer to the “What Makes a Novel a Novel?” worksheets they completed about their favorite novels in Lesson 2, or the class reading discussed in previous lessons on plot.) How does each setting contribute to mood in the novel? Have students consider how each work would be different if the author had set events in a totally different place or time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a few of your students read what they wrote in the beginning of class aloud and ask other students to discuss how different aspects of the student’s description of that setting helped create a mood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Practice Creating Settings with Mood as a Class                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hand out copies of the "Settings and Mood" section of the "Settings" worksheet. Complete the first section as a class. Read each of the moods listed aloud. As you do, have students share setting details that would help to create that mood and write their ideas on the board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a class, brainstorm other “moods” that a setting could reinforce. Write all the moods you come up with as a class on the board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Four: Practice On Their Own                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have your students fill out the second section of the worksheet on their own. They can either use the moods from your brainstorm session, or they can come up with new ones. Roam the room to make sure your students are all grasping the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Five: Group Noveling                20 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have students get in their noveling groups and take out their group plot outline. As a group, have them fill out the third section of the "Settings and Mood" worksheet. Make sure that they take some time to think about where each scene takes place, and what emotions they want their readers to feel in that scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Six: Closing It Up                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have time, have a few groups share a setting from their group novel with the class, and then have other groups guess 1) what the mood of the setting is, and 2) what part of the plot (set-up, inciting incident, rising action, climax, falling action, or resolution) the setting is in. Ask groups to identify the precise words or phrases that helped them identify the mood in each example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As homework, have your students fill out the third section of the "Settings and Mood" section of the "Settings" worksheet in regards to their own individual novels. Remind them to use precise words and phrases to convey the mood of different settings as they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 9: Settings That Reinforce Characters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Writing: 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, event sequence, characters) using relevant sensory details; 10 Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.
* Grade 7: Writing: 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, conflict, complex characters) with relevant and specific sensory details; 10. Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.
* Grade 8: Writing: 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, plot, event sequence, complex characters) with well-chosen, relevant, and specific sensory details; 10. Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson Time: 50 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT:
1. Write for a short period of time to describe a given setting in detail.
2. Recognize how settings can be used to reinforce (or mirror) characters.
3. Use sensory details to describe settings and characters.
4. Establish and develop settings that reinforce some of the characters in their group novels in class and in their own individual novels as homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* Copies of the "Settings That Reinforce Characters" section of the "Settings" worksheet; one for each student. This can also be found on page 36 of the Young Novelist Workbook.
* Extra copies of the "Settings That Reinforce Characters" worksheet, one for each four-person noveling group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: Describe Your Bedroom                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their journals or on a separate sheet of paper, have students describe their bedrooms in as much detail as possible. To prompt them, ask, “What’s hanging on your walls? What books are on your shelves? What kinds of clothes are hanging in your closet or in your dresser drawers? What color paint or wallpaper is on the walls? What does it smell like?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: Introduce Settings That Reinforce Character                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say, “Last time, we practiced developing settings that create mood in our novels. Today, we are going to learn an even more incredibly sophisticated writing trick. We are going to use setting to reinforce characters. For example, I bet a person could tell a lot about you if they saw your bedroom.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have your students pair up with partners and read each others' bedroom descriptions. After they finish reading each others' descriptions, give students time to write about aspects of their partner's personality that he or she inferred from the description of their partner's bedroom. Once everyone has finished, ask a few students to share what they found out about their partners by reading a description of their rooms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the following examples to further illustrate the point that setting can be used to describe or reinforce character:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry was having a hard time. He felt sad and trapped. He was once a famous author, but he hadn’t written a word in years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now, let’s listen to how the writer uses setting to describe Larry!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry’s apartment was less of a living space than a glorified closet. The bathroom was just big enough to sit on the toilet without having his knees touch the sink, and the window was more like a ship’s porthole. The bed was so small his feet hung over the edge, and there was really not much to do but watch static on the television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place did not have a kitchen, so he bought a hotplate to make his single-serving meals. He ate the same thing every night, but he did not seem to mind the monotony of his repeated dinner of rice, wilted spinach, and baked beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only item on the wall of Larry’s apartment was a framed, yellowed copy of the New York Times Best Seller list from 16 years ago. Larry’s name was at the top of it. Below the newspaper clipping, on Larry’s desk, sat an old, dusty typewriter and an even dustier stack of blank paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you are done, ask your students how the second example shows the reader without telling the reader all about Larry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Practice Reinforcing Characters With Setting as a Class        10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hand out copies of the "Settings That Reinforce Character" section of the "Settings" worksheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a class, try to come up with some settings that reinforce the first three characters listed. Do these first three orally, going around the room and having students suggest a bit of setting detail to reinforce the character. Encourage students to include sensory details. To prompt them, tell them to make pictures in their mind that include how things look, feel, sound, smell, and even taste. Point out that they can convey these ideas to readers through the use of descriptive words and images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Four: Group Noveling!                20 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have your students get in their noveling groups and pass out extra worksheets to each group. Have them fill out the second section of the worksheet to create settings that reinforce each of their group novel’s characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Five: Share the Settings                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is time, have a few groups share some of their character-reinforcing settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As homework, have your students individually fill out the second section of the worksheet to create settings that reinforce each of their own characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 10: Writing Really Good Dialogue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Writing: 3d. Choose words and phrases to develop the events, experiences, and ideas precisely.
* Grade 7: Writing: 3d. Choose words and phrases to develop the events, experiences, and ideas precisely and to create mood.
* Grade 8: Writing: 3d. Choose words and phrases to effectively develop the events, experiences, and ideas precisely and to create mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson Time: 55 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT:
1. Understand the role of dialogue .
2. Develop the characters and events in their group novel by adding relevant dialogue that includes precise words and phrases.
3. Write robust dialogue for their own novels using dialogue tags and correct dialogue conventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* Transparency with two Instant Message chats on it for the intro activity; see Step One.
* A copy of the "Writing Really Good Dialogue" worksheet; one for each student. This can also be found on page 39 of the Young Novelist Workbook.
* Extra copies of the blank Comic Strip worksheets; three per noveling group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: Fascinating IM-ing                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a transparency of the following two IM chats. Keep the second one covered for now and read the first chat to the class or have two students read it aloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:booger2@gletter.com"&gt;booger2@gletter.com&lt;/a&gt;: hey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:nuggetzogold@hotletter.com"&gt;nuggetzogold@hotletter.com&lt;/a&gt;: hey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:booger2@gletter.com"&gt;booger2@gletter.com&lt;/a&gt;: omg, crazy day&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:booger2@gletter.com"&gt;booger2@gletter.com&lt;/a&gt;: peace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask, “What do you know about these characters from the words in this conversation? Do you care about these characters at all? What if this was a ten page conversation—would you keep reading?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now uncover another version of that conversation and read it to the class or have students do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:booger2@gletter.com"&gt;booger2@gletter.com&lt;/a&gt;: hey tammy&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:booger2@gletter.com"&gt;booger2@gletter.com&lt;/a&gt; is signed off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:nuggetzogold@hotletter.com"&gt;nuggetzogold@hotletter.com&lt;/a&gt;: TAMMY?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, ask the same questions you asked for the first IM conversation again. Your students should note that the second IM conversation was a lot more interesting and suspenseful than the first one. Encourage them to explain why and to identify specific words and phrases that made this conversation more engaging or realistic. Point out that in novel dialogue, a few well-chosen words and phrases can make all the difference in keeping readers hooked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say, “We learned about plot last week, now we're going to learn about how characters can deepen that plot through the conversations they have with each other.” Ask students if they'd thought about how their characters sound and speak as they filled out their questionnaires. Announce that today you will be discussing conversation in real life versus dialogue in a novel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: Real Life vs. Novel Dialogue                15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask, “What is dialogue, anyway?” Create a definition as a class, then reveal another definition in case the class version is too wordy, and you think students need something easy to remember.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definition: Dialogue is a conversation between two or more characters. The exact words they speak are typically put between quotation marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now hand out the "Writing Really Good Dialogue" worksheet, and read through the three ways dialogue functions in a story. Assign students to speak the dialogue in the examples while you or another student narrates. Ask students to tell whether the dialogue in the worksheet moves the story forward, increases tension, or defines characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point out how the author could easily have just described these conversations happening. In the first instance, it could have been "Jerry picked up the phone and a guy on the other line said he was Jerry’s brother.” In the second it could have been “Everyone wanted to run away, but Dave wanted to go back and save Susan.” Ask a student to try and summarize the third example into a sentence with no dialogue. Ask students which version they liked better and why. Record answers on the board. Guide students to conclude that dialogue is more interesting than straight narrative all the time because ____.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project the IM transparencies again. Ask your students which one accomplished the three purposes of novel dialogue, and how it accomplished them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, emphasize the importance, absent in the IM chats, of writing outside the dialogue using dialogue tags. Explain that dialogue tags describe what people are doing while they are speaking, and how they are saying their words. Draw students’ attention to the first little bit of dialogue at the top of their worksheet, which is an example of boring, but necessary, everyday dialogue. Then read the following two short paragraphs aloud to show them how important it is to describe what characters are doing while they speak using "dialogue tags."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, dude. How are you?” Sam asked nervously, getting up from the bleachers. She had waited an hour for Aaron to walk by. He was with a few friends, but she didn’t mind. She just needed to talk.
“I’m really good. Thanks for asking. And you?” His tone was cold and overly formal. Was this the same guy from last night? His body was stiff, and he didn’t seem to be slowing down.
“Good, thanks,” she answered as he passed by, her voice trailing off. Her head turned to watch him go. She felt tears coming to her eyes, so she quickly grabbed her bag and ran the other way, missing Aaron’s glance back at her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey, dude. How are you?” Jason said to Emil, like he did every morning.
“I’m really good. Thanks for asking. And you?” Emil replied, as always.
“Good, thanks,” Jason said, rounding out their obligatory morning greeting. Both men still appreciated their cordial working relationship, even though both were by now sick of jumping into a tank full of fish-meat every day to sift out tiny bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same dialogue, totally different story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Group Noveling                20 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have students get into their noveling groups. Hand out three copies of the blank Comic Strip worksheet to each group. Tell students to pick a part, or three parts, of their plot and write dialogue onto the comic strip that does each of the three things dialogue should do. Encourage students to write dialogue using as many of their characters as possible. (Examples: One scene could feature dialogue between the protagonist and the supporting character at the inciting incident that helps define their characters. Or, the dialogue could build tension between the protagonist and antagonist at the climax.) Say, “No matter who speaks in each comic strip, all four group members must write the dialogue together.” Refer to "Role Rules" for clarity. Also point out that it is not necessary to use quotation marks in the comic strips because they'll be using speech bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Four: Read Aloud!                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call on groups to read their parts aloud. Have other groups try and name which of the three roles of dialogue the readers accomplished. Ask if those were the ones the reading group intended to accomplish. It might be more than one at once, and that is great! Also encourage students to point out any words or phrases they thought helped make each part especially believable or interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="as-homework-have-your-students-write-three-scenes-of-dialogue-on-their-own-using-characters-from-their-individual-nano-novels-this-time-they-must-write-the-dialogue-in-their-notebooks-and-add-dialogue-tags-and-quotation-marks-in-the-correct-places-for-models-of-how-to-place-quotation-marks-correctly-and-use-appropriate-capitalization-in-dialogue-have-them-refer-to-the-dialogue-found-in-this-lessons-worksheet-or-in-novels-they-have-read-and-liked-remind-them-that-whenever-they-get-stuck-the-best-way-to-get-ideas-for-their-own-writing-is-to-look-at-what-other-writers-have-already-done-this-includes-not-only-published-novels-but-the-work-of-classmates-whose-writing-they-admire"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;As homework, have your students write three scenes of dialogue on their own using characters from their individual NaNo-novels. This time, they must write the dialogue in their notebooks and add dialogue tags and quotation marks in the correct places. For models of how to place quotation marks correctly and use appropriate capitalization in dialogue, have them refer to the dialogue found in this lesson’s worksheet or in novels they have read and liked. Remind them that whenever they get stuck, the best way to get ideas for their own writing is to look at what other writers have already done! This includes not only published novels, but the work of classmates whose writing they admire.&lt;/h2&gt;

* Grade 6: Writing: 3a. Write narratives in which they engage and orient the reader by establishing a context and point of view, and organize a sequence of events or experiences; 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, event sequence, characters) using relevant sensory details; 4. Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience; 10. Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.

Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson Time: 60 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT:
1. Understand and identify the four places where a story can begin and how each influences the development of plot in a story.
2. Create multiple beginnings for their group novels.
3. Begin the extended-writing phase of their noveling projects by creating appropriate beginnings for their own novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* Rollercoaster visual for Student X either drawn on the board like it is drawn in the workbook, or on a transparency using a blank "Plot Rollercoaster."
* "Beginnings" visual aid; explained in Step Two.
* Students’ filled-in copies of the worksheet from Lesson 2: "What Makes a Novel a Novel?"
* One clean copy of the "Back to the Beginning" worksheet per student. This can also be found on page 56 in the Young Novelist Workbook.
* Prizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: A Day in the Life of…                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once all students are seated, ask a student (Student X) to come up to the front of the class and tell the story of his/her day so far. Tell that student and the class that we are all going to pretend that Student X’s goal throughout the day has been to make it to this class to learn about novel writing. Ask if he or she can think of some sort of an antagonist from his/her day, and maybe some supporting characters. Even if they have to make it up, make sure their day has an inciting incident and a climax! Note: If you know this would take a long time for your students, make up a funny story about your own day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now refer the "Plot Rollercoaster" visual on the board/transparency and mark Student X’s or your own day’s events in the appropriate places. The class should tell you where to put things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say, “Notice how in remembering your own day you sometimes jump around? You don’t always start at the beginning. Real life has this funny thing about it where you always try to start from the beginning, but when you tell a story you can start wherever you want!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review/Preview: Say, "We are so close to starting our novels now that we've learned how." Ask students what they have learned so far. After students respond, say that today we will learn how to start our novels and get this show on the road.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: Where Does It Begin?                25 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain the four kinds of beginnings using a poster/transparency with the definitions of each kind of beginning paraphrased from the worksheet on it. Choose the language you feel your students would grasp best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example of what to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First, stories can start at the set-up, before anything has happened. Stories like this often begin with some phrase like 'once upon a time,’ or ‘long ago,’ or a description of the protagonist going about his/her/its normal life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a story starts at the inciting incident, we first meet the protagonist experiencing that event that sets the ball rolling for the story. Then the author will go back and describe what led up to the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the pattern for the story starting with the climax, falling action, or resolution. We call those kinds of beginnings in media res, meaning ‘in the middle of things’ in Latin. When you start here, you throw a whole lot of information at the reader as though they were familiar with the story, then you jump backwards in time to explain. Think of movies that start when the villain’s sword is raised over the hero’s head and then the scene cuts to a time when the hero was at his desk and it says ‘three years earlier’ at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final way you can start a novel is at the end. This is tricky, since you can’t give all the details away. You can tell the reader how things end up, but leave enough mystery for them to keep reading."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have each student look back at his or her notes on the worksheet from Lesson 2: "What Makes a Novel a Novel?" to recall the beginning of their favorite novel. Have volunteers identify which type of beginning their author used and how this “set up” the plot for the rest of the book. If possible, try to find examples of each type of beginning; if no one has an example of one of the less-common types, such as starting at the end, ask them to think of other novels or even movies they have seen that started this way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, say, “Now let’s try to start the story of Student X’s day from different parts of the plot.” Announce that you are going to play a very short game called "Where Does it Begin?” Split the room into noveling groups or new groups if students need a change. Choose one person from each team to come up and silently pick a folded piece of paper out of the bag/hat/box that you are holding. Tell them not to open it until they are back with their teams. On those pieces of paper will be “set-up,” “inciting incident,” “in media res,” or “the end.” Teams must quietly write the first line or two of the novel of Student X’s day according to their piece of paper. They will only have 5 minutes to write. The teacher should walk around the room and offer guidance while students are writing. Afterward, each team can read their first lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams earn:
* One point for writing the correct kind of beginning.
* One for another team guessing their beginning correctly.
* And one for guessing another team’s beginning correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team with the most points after every team has read will earn a small prize. When time is up, congratulate everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Group Noveling or Individual Noveling                15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you teach this lesson before November 1, break students up into noveling groups for one last time. Pass out one "Beginnings" worksheet per group and ask them to write all four kinds of beginnings together. Encourage groups to discuss how each type of beginning might impact the way the rest of the novel would have to be written. (If they choose to start the novel in media res, for example, they would have to decide whether to proceed chronologically to the climax next or to flash back to the start of the story before moving on to the climax.). Walk around the room and provide some inspiration where it is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this is November 1, have students take out their workbooks or hand copies of the "Beginnings" worksheet to each student, and have them silently write their first lines. Advise them to experiment on the worksheet with multiple kinds of beginnings and choose the one that works best. If students tell you they know exactly how they want to start, congratulate them and send them off into the land of noveling. Walk around the room to help, but try not to get too involved. Help students to make words come faster, not necessarily to find better words. They have a lofty goal to reach, after all! Always remind students that, unlike the messes they make at home, they shouldn’t even think about cleaning up their messy writing for a whole month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Four: Read Aloud!                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If students have been group noveling, have each group share the beginning they liked the best and how this beginning would set up the plot of their group’s novel. Homework in this case would be completing the worksheet for their own novels, so hand out worksheets to your students before they leave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If students have just been writing their own novels, quietly announce that students who want to read their first lines, or want inspiration from a fellow student may quietly move to Side X of the room. Those who are on a roll may keep going. On the reading aloud side of the room, have some students read. Ask students who seem stumped to discuss their problems and invite other students to make suggestions. Make sure to whisper in order to respect the diligence of the students who are still writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework in this case is to write, write, write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to Keep Your Kids Writing During November!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve taught all the lesson plans up to this point, your students have some cool characters, a plot with a beginning, middle, and end, some fun settings, and the know-how to write dialogue. At this point, your kids are probably anxious to get started, but before you and your students dive headfirst into your month-long, seat-of-your-pants noveling adventure, we would like to pass along some tips that we’ve gathered from experienced NaNoWriMo teachers to help you and your kids avoid Noveling Burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noveling Burnout usually happens around Week Two or Week Three, but can sometimes come as early as Day Two or Day Three. After the initial excitement of writing a novel wears off, the sudden realization that writing a novel isn’t as easy as expected creeps up on kids like a lion on a sleeping zebra. At one point in November, each and every one of your students will show symptoms of Noveling Burnout, but the trick is not to let it overtake them. Here are some tips to help keep both spirits and word-counts high!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be Dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more dramatic you are right from the get-go about National Novel Writing Month, the longer that sense of noveling excitement will linger with your students. Throw a Kick-Off Party to get their spirits going early! Be sure you’ve filled out your progress chart, attached all the "Imagination Activated" buttons, and are ready to chart some progress with your NaNoWriMo stickers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the progress chart isn’t dramatic enough, do what one teacher did and make a wall-sized chart. If that’s still not enough, do what another teacher did and put a gigantic banner on the outside of your classroom with updated daily word-count totals painted on it in bright red paint. This is especially great if more than one classroom at your school is participating. Competition can be a great motivator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Advantage of NaNoWriMo’s Online Resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our regular pep talks, from well-known YA authors, inspire even the most burned-out of students and teachers. You can either read them out loud to your class or, if you have time, print out copies, stuff them into envelopes, and put them on your students' desks before they arrive in the morning! (You can always write your own, too!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilize your Virtual Classroom. If you’re set up to communicate with your kids through this tool, you can easily forge noveling connections beyond the school day. Post funny announcements and interesting links; start exciting discussions in your dedicated forum; send encouraging NaNoMail messages... Whatever you do, make sure it’s getting your students excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your students  may be too young to take advantage of the full writer community. But if you or a parent can browse the site with them, they will get a new sense of how big the NaNoWriMo YWP writing world really is, and in turn, how cool it is to be a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dare Machine is a homepage block that features different writing prompts that we here at NaNoWriMo call Dares. The machine will "dare" your students to add new characters, plot twists, and more to their novels. Dares are a super-fun way to get your students' novels out of a rut and back into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring in the Muse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When spirits are really low, it’s time to treat your students like the authors that they are. Some teachers call it “bringing in the muse,” some call it "bribery," but all of them say that it works wonders. Give out small prizes (like pencils or stickers) to kids who reach certain word-count goals. Let them sit on the floor while they write. Guide them on a walk around campus to give their aching eyes and hands a rest. Remind them of the free proof copies of their novels they can receive. Reward them in any way you can to make sure that they know how proud you are of them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, back to teaching. The following lesson plans are designed to keep your kids writing throughout November. We hope that they inspire plot twists, develop characters, and most importantly, help raise those word counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 12: Details, Details, Details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Writing: 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, event sequence, characters) using relevant sensory details; 3d. Choose words and phrases to develop the events, experiences, and ideas precisely; 4. Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience; 10. Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.
* Grade 7: Writing: 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, conflict, complex characters) with relevant and specific sensory details; 3d. Choose words and phrases to develop the events, experiences, and ideas precisely and to create mood; 4. Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience; 10. Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.
* Grade 8: Writing: 3b. Write narratives in which they develop narrative elements (e.g., setting, plot, event sequence, complex characters) with well-chosen, relevant, and specific sensory details; 3d. Choose words and phrases to effectively develop the events, experiences, and ideas precisely and to create mood; 4. Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience; 10. Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson time: 60 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT:
1. Reflect on their sensory experiences.
2. Choose words and phrases, including similes and metaphors, that convey sensory details and develop the plots and characters of their novels.
3. Continue the extended-writing phase of their noveling projects by adding details to their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* An unfamiliar item for the intro activity; explained in Step One.
* “This Room” chart; explained in Step Two.
* Copies of the "Details, Details, Details" worksheet for each student. This can also be found on page 60 of the Young Novelist Workbook.
* Students must also bring their novels in progress to class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: Writing Prompt                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, congratulate students on having begun their writing journey. You are happy to see that everyone is still energized, but you know it’s tiring. Today should help things go a little easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give students 2 minutes to write a description of an item that you bring that is somewhat mysterious (examples: a small sculpture, an antique you own, a garlic press, or other unusual kitchen item, etc) in as many words as possible…but tell them that there is a catch. Give them a list of words on the board that they cannot use. These should be the words on the "Details, Details, Details" worksheet that have "Word Banks," plus any other obvious and overused description words that the students might be tempted to use for this specific item. Ask students for word counts of student's descriptions at the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say, "Authors have an important job in society; they are like observation superheroes. Authors have to be highly aware of themselves and the world around them so that they can create believable and interesting worlds in their books. They have to be able to make the reader feel like what is happening in a book is real even if what is happening is that a purple dog is flying to Cancun with his cheetah girlfriend on a plane made of rubber bands. Readers must feel that the scenario is possible, and that they are right there with the dog. This means authors have to use all their senses to describe things. Oh, and using a lot of these sensory details will also boost your word count! You all just explored sight; now we will explore other senses.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: Getting in Touch With Your Senses                15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go over what the five senses are again. Ask students if they think there are ever times when they are not using all their senses. What about right now? Create the following chart before class and hang it on the board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell students to take 10 seconds to get in touch with all of their senses. Then call on students until you have one description for each sense. Go sense by sense, pausing in between to ask students to really focus on that sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell students that they can tune into their surroundings whenever they're writing their novels. Now pass out the "Details, Details, Details" worksheet and ask students to pick one setting from the first section and describe it with all their senses on their own for the next 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Tastes Like a Simile Is a Metaphor                15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middle school students have probably already learned about what similes and metaphors are, but review them because these concepts will be essential to making word-count goals. Ask for definitions from students until you have them down. Eventually conclude: Similes compare one thing to another using "like" or "as." Metaphors compare by saying something is something else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell students to pick two items from the bonus section of the worksheet to describe for the next 10 minutes. They must use sensory details to describe the items with only similes and metaphors, but they cannot use all similes or all metaphors. As they write, walk around the room and makes sure students grasp the activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Four: Write!                25 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have students work on their novels for the rest of class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the homework is to work on their novels!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 13: Sub-Plotting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Writing: 4 Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience; 10 Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.
* Grade 7: Writing: 4 Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience; 10 Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.
* Grade 8: Writing: 4 Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience; 10 Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson Time: 60 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of the lesson, SWBAT:
1. Continue the extended-writing phase of their noveling projects by establishing and developing multiple subplots to their novels.
2. Develop and add complex, minor, or supporting characters to their novels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* Copies of the "Sub-Plotting" worksheet; one for each student. This can also be found on page 72 of the Young Novelist Workbook.
* An episode of a 30-minute TV sitcom that your students may not be familiar with. Perhaps one “from before their time” like The Cosby Show, Full House, Saved by the Bell, or The Wonder Years. You also want to make sure it is an episode with at least one obvious subplot.
* Something to play the episode on such as a TV/DVD player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: Supporting Characters are People Too                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write on the board:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does your most important supporting character want more than anything in the world?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is he or she most afraid of?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is his or her greatest weakness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give your students 5 minutes to answer these three questions about their most important supporting character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: Introduce Sub-plotting                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask your students to tell you what a subplot is. Eventually, write a definition you come up with as a class on the board. You want to make sure your students understand that a subplot follows a supporting character on their own journey to get what he or she wants. Subplots may interweave with the main plot, but they do not need to have much to do with the main character's journey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask your students to name some supporting characters and their subplots from books that you have read as a class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Watching TV                40 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give your students the good news: You’re going to watch some TV! Then tell them the not-so-great news: They’re not watching a reality TV show and they have to take really good notes while they’re watching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hand out the "Sub-Plotting" worksheet and, as a class, read over the five questions that your students must answer as they watch the show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions on the handout include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is the protagonist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many supporting characters are there? Who are they? How are they related to the protagonist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the subplots? These are the plots that involve the supporting characters. They may include the main character, but sometimes the protagonist has little to no connection to the subplots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the supporting characters have their own antagonists? Or are they battling the same antagonist as the protagonist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways do these subplots make the show more exciting to watch?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch the show!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you are done watching, take 10 minutes to discuss the answers to the five questions as a class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Four: Noveling                        5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close the class by encouraging students to refer to the questions that they answered about their supporting characters at the beginning of class as they continue writing their novels. Explain that they can add subplots to their novels for as many supporting characters as they like by answering those three questions for each additional character. Remind them that whenever they feel like their main plot is slowing down, they can explore a subplot. For specific examples of how supporting characters and sub-plotting can be used in novels, have students refer back to the “model novels” they chose in Lesson 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write, write, write!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 14: Character Interviews on NaNo-TV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Writing: 5. With some guidance and support from peers and adults, strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach.
* Grade 7: Writing: 5. With some guidance and support from peers and adults, strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach after rethinking how well questions of purpose have been addressed.
* Grade 8: Writing: 5. With some guidance and support from peers and adults, strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach after rethinking how well questions of purpose and context have been addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson Time: 45–55 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT:
1. Through peer collaboration, try a new approach to strengthening their writing.
2. Develop major and minor characters by “stepping into their characters’ shoes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: We’ve created three interviews for your students’ characters (protagonist, supporting, and antagonist), under the premise that students’ characters have been invited to be interviewed on TV. This lesson can be duplicated for the supporting character interview and the antagonist interview and be spread over three days. And they don’t have to be consecutive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* A box of props for students to wear including things like hats, wigs, funny articles of clothing...whatever you can find!
* Copies of the "Character Interviews on NaNo-TV" worksheet; one for each student. This can also be found on page 74 of the Young Novelist Workbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: Your Characters’ Closets                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a separate sheet of paper, have students make a list of clothes and accessories that are in each of their characters' closets (their protagonist, a supporting character, and their antagonist). They should make a list of at least five items per character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: Introduce Character Interviews on NaNo TV                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Announce that all the students’ characters have been invited to be interviewed on NaNo-TV! Say, “Unfortunately, your characters can’t make it because they are so busy being in your novel. That means that you will have to step into your characters’ shoes and pretend to be them while they are on TV. Your character will be asked questions during the television interview, and you
will have to answer in the voice of your character.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Interviews                30–40 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have students take out the lists of items in their characters’ closets, then each pick a prop item from the prop box that his or her protagonist might wear. (If students request items that are not in the box, they can use the power of imagination to pretend they are wearing the items they need!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pair students up and start with the "Protagonist" interview. Have one student play the part of host, while their partner plays the part of their protagonist. Have the first student interview the second. Encourage interviewees to include as much detailed language as possible to give the TV viewers a solid idea of who their characters are. (10 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now have the students switch roles. The second student will now interview the first. (10 minutes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your students are anxious to get to novel writing, you can go ahead and let them at their novels. If they seem to be enjoying this activity, encourage another round of interview questions, having students now make up their own questions to ask their partners (who are still acting as their protagonists).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Four: Closing It Up                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have students step out of their characters’ shoes by returning items to the prop box. Let them know that they will be interviewed as their supporting character and antagonist in the future and should bring in props/clothing items from home if they saw that there was nothing that would work in the prop box for those characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework is to keep writing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throwing a “Thank Goodness It's Over” Party&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are, the end of this year’s NaNoWriMo leaves you and your students relieved—but also a little sad. There’s no better way to celebrate your students’ hard work than by throwing the kind of Thank Goodness It's Over (TGIO) celebration your students deserve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things you can do to make this party special. TGIO parties are thrown all around the world in all of our different chapters and in many classrooms. Some are thrown on December 1, as soon as the initial drafting process is over, but if you are having your students read at the party, you may need to allow extra time as your kids revise and pick excerpts to read. Having a reading at the TGIO allows students to share the celebration with family and friends! No matter when you throw it, though, try to have the party before your kids go on their winter break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ideas for your TGIO:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host a Reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reading might the best way to celebrate your students’ new works of fiction. You can either host a reading in your classroom during school hours, or you can host one after school so your students’ families can come bask in the glory of their young novelists. If you have the time and energy, call your local independent bookstore or library to see if you can host the reading there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Keep individual reading times short (five minutes tops) so everyone who wants to read has a turn before attention spans run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand Out Prizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand out your “Imagination Activated” buttons, plus any extra stickers, pencils, or other small prizes you’ve picked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you print out certificates for each of your students. We have both winner and participant certificates, so everyone (no matter what their final word count is) should get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above and Beyond:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of our more energetic teachers have gone above and beyond for their students’ TGIO parties. They’ve invited local authors to speak, they’ve videotaped the readings, and they've even had T-shirts made for the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="no-matter-what-we-encourage-you-to-make-your-tgio-as-special-as-you-can-for-your-class-they-deserve-it"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No matter what, we encourage you to make your TGIO as special as you can for your class. They deserve it!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;tt class="docutils"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, line 1437)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title underline too short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
No matter what, we encourage you to make your TGIO as special as you can for your class. They deserve it!

&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 15: Taking the “Work” Out of Workshopping&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Writing: 4. Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience; 5. With some guidance and support from peers and adults, strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach.
* Grade 7: Writing: 4. Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience; 5. With some guidance and support from peers and adults, strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach after rethinking how well questions of purpose have been addressed.
* Grade 8: Writing: 4. Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience; 5. With some guidance and support from peers and adults, strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach after rethinking how well questions of purpose and context have been addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson Time: 60 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT:
1. Identify basic ground rules for providing constructive criticism.
2. Work with peers to identify strengths of their own novels as well as areas in need of revision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* If possible, a 5-minute clip from a popular television makeover show such as “What Not to Wear.” The clip should include footage of the show’s experts lovingly critiquing whatever or whoever is being “made over.”
* Equipment for viewing the television clip, if applicable.
* Each student should provide two clean, printed, double-spaced copies of the first five pages of his or her novel. You may also want to request that students format their excerpt consistently (Times New Roman, 12 pt., double-sided). If your students wrote their novels by hand, they should bring in photocopies of the first five pages. Tell students that in addition to formatting their pages they might also want to spend a few minutes circling or fixing any grossly distracting errors that might make their writing hard to read—but they should not spend too much time on this.
* One clean copy of “The Workshop” worksheet per student and two clean copies of the “Reader Review Worksheet.” These can also be found starting on page 86 of the Young Novelist Workbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: The Gentle Makeover                15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before you begin, tell students that they will be watching a brief clip from a television makeover show. As they watch, ask them to notice how the “experts” on the show speak as they provide their criticism. Are they nice? Are they mean? Do they seem to be sympathetic to the “makeoveree”? (Alternately, if you cannot show a TV clip or wish not to, invite volunteers to describe what a “makeover” is and if they have ever seen anyone or anything made over on TV. Have them describe the makeovers they saw.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the clip or initial discussion of makeover shows is finished, ask, “What did you notice about how the experts explained what needed to be ‘made over’? If you were selected for a makeover, would you want the expert to talk to you like that? Why?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: Finally, Feedback!                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell students that the moment of truth has finally arrived: It’s time for them to release their novels out into the world! Fortunately, this first time, their novels will be seen by friendly classmates who, like the “experts” on a makeover show, want to help them bring out what is already great about their writing. Then they will use these suggestions to improve their work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribute one copy of “The Workshop” worksheets to each student. Together, read the guidelines for reviewing one another’s first five pages. You may also remind students of the discussion on respect they had at the very beginning of their novel-writing adventure. Also take suggestions for any other ground rules that students feel are important. Explain that in class today, each student will read the first five pages of a partner’s newly written novel and fill out one worksheet for that partner, then fill out a worksheet for a different partner for homework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Workshop                30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribute two clean copies of the “Reader Review Worksheet” to each student. Then have each student exchange his or her novel excerpt with a partner and get to work silently reading and commenting on the draft as well as filling out the worksheet. Circulate among the group to keep the students’ attentions focused, and make sure everyone is following the agreed-upon workshop rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide time warnings after 10 minutes to help students who read more slowly pace themselves. After 15 minutes, point out that any students who are still reading should stop, mark where they stopped reading on the drafts, and turn their attention to filling out the worksheets. As students finish making notes, have them meet with one another to quietly discuss their comments and questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Four: Share                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead students in a brief discussion about the workshopping process so far. What kinds of comments are students finding helpful? Is it hard or easy to follow the workshopping guidelines? Are there any guidelines that need changing? Invite responses from as many students as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may also wish to post a list of items each student will need to bring to the next lesson: marked-up copies of his or her novel excerpts and those of classmates, a clean, typed, double-spaced, copy of his or her novel (single or double-sided) in its entirety, and if possible a red pen, blue pen, or other colorful pen for making edits. If students typed drafts but do not have printers at home, suggest alternative ways they might be able to print their novels, such as at a copy store, asking friends or relatives or, if possible, using a school printer. Again, make sure the students’ novels are formatted consistently (Times New Roman, 12 pt.). Students who hand-wrote their novels should make photocopies so as not to mark up their only drafts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have each student exchange their first five pages with a different classmate. For homework, students can read one another’s excerpts and complete the second “Reader Review Worksheet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 16: Novel, Take 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Writing: 5. With some guidance and support from peers and adults, strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach.
* Grade 7: Writing: 5. With some guidance and support from peers and adults, strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach after rethinking how well questions of purpose have been addressed.
* Grade 8: Writing: 5. With some guidance and support from peers and adults, strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach after rethinking how well questions of purpose and context have been addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson Time: 60 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT:
1. Work with peers to identify areas of their novels in need of revision, then identify specific strategies for revising.
2. Start revising!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* Each student should bring in the one marked-up copy of his/her novel excerpt, plus the completed “Reader Review Worksheet” from the previous lesson’s workshop.
* Each student should bring in the novel excerpt that he or she marked up for a partner for homework, plus the accompanying worksheet.
* Each student should also have one clean copy of his/her entire novel draft. If students typed drafts but do not have printers at home, suggest alternative ways they might be able to print their novels, such as at a copy store, asking friends or relatives or, if possible, using a school printer. Students who hand-wrote their novels should make photocopies so as not to mark up their only drafts.
* One clean copy of the “Unleash Your Inner Editor” worksheet per student. This can also be found on page 90 of the Young Novelist Workbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If you chose not to require your students to mark up and give feedback on a second student's novel excerpt for homework, you can have students work with their original partners throughout this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: Draft Exchange                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have students meet briefly with the partners whose drafts they read for homework. Have them return their excerpts and "Reader Review Worksheets" and give partners approximately 5 minutes to read over and ask any questions they might have about each others' feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: Speed Praise                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have everyone gather together again or, if working with a very large group, break them into teams of roughly 15 students each. Make sure “partners” from the homework assignment are grouped together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invite everyone to recall the makeover clip they watched in the previous lesson. What did they learn from the clip about how to give feedback to classmates? Remind students that, as with a makeover, the point of the workshop has been to bring out what is already great about their writing! Tell them that to drive this idea home, they will do a “lightning round” of praise for the novel drafts they read for homework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share the rules of the lightning round: You will begin by passing a simple classroom object, such as a book or pen, to one student in the group. That student must quickly and in one sentence, but with as much detail as possible, describe something awesome about his or her partner’s novel. For example: “Tameeka’s characters are so cool and quirky, like her main character who always has a snappy comeback for everything!” The instant that student is done talking, he or she should pass (not throw!) the object to any other student in the group, who must then do the same thing for his or her partner as quickly as possible. Groups continue the round for 7 minutes, with students going more than once if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Goal-Setting                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell students that by now, they should have a sense of some of their novels’ strengths as well as areas they need to work on. This means they’re almost ready to actually revise them in their entirety! Explain that revising a novel may take weeks or years, depending on how much work the author wants to put into it, but generally speaking the more work the author does, the better the finished novel and the more chance it has of being published. Pause for a moment to let this sink in. Then ask, “Anyone overwhelmed yet?” and take a show of hands. Explain that, while it’s natural to be overwhelmed by the prospect of revising such long pieces of writing, you’ve got lots of tricks to make the process easier. (You may also explain that there are some strange, twisted people out there who actually like revising and editing. Some of them even do it for a living!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure each student has the following items: a clean copy of the novel, a copy of the “Unleash the Inner Editor” worksheet, and all the feedback he or she has received from partners. Tell students that the day has come to let their Inner Editors out of captivity, and their pens are their Inner Editors’ secret weapon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the introduction to the worksheet together. Then walk students through the process of goal-setting by reading the explanation aloud and giving students a moment to reflect and write. Reinforce that their goals may be very specific or very broad, but they should be attainable. Have volunteers share goals they came up with, accepting all responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Four: Make an Editing Plan                35 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students can now begin filling out the remainder of the worksheet independently, based on the feedback they received from classmates and the goals they set for their own writing. Provide help as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Five: Release the Inner Editor!                Last moment of class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point students can continue to officially set their Inner Editors loose on their novels! You may wish to dramatize this occasion by “whooshing” or orally trumpeting the Editors’ triumphant release song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell students to choose one of the revision goals they listed on their worksheets, no matter how big or small, and that their homework for the next week is to revise their novels according to that item. The next week, have students share the changes they've made, and their revision experience, with a partner or the entire class (depending on the size of your group). Encourage them to be impressed by their own writing as they reread their novels, perhaps for the first time! Some students may be surprised that they enjoy the revision process as much or even more than the writing process. If you so choose, have your students focus on a different goal each week until they have completely revised their novels, before moving onto the next lesson, "Cleaning It Up."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are not going to require students to revise their entire novels in your class, take some time at the end of this lesson to put cooperative support in place for students who wish to revise their novels at length. Help students who are really “into” the process form writers’ groups where they can exchange their drafts. This encourages students to both give and receive more in-depth feedback, as well as be accountable for their writing. Make sure to check in with these groups over the rest of the school year to encourage their cooperative efforts!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 17: Cleaning it Up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Writing: 5. With some guidance and support from peers and adults, strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach. Language: 1a. Ensure that pronouns are in the proper case (subjective, objective, possessive); 1b. Recognize and correct inappropriate shifts in pronoun number and person; 2a. Use commas, parentheses, or dashes to set off nonrestrictive/parenthetical elements; 2b. Spell correctly; 3b. Vary sentence patterns for meaning, reader/listener interest, and style.
* Grade 7: Writing: 5. With some guidance and support from peers and adults, strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach after rethinking how well questions of purpose have been addressed. Language: 1b. Chose among simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences to signal differing relationships among ideas; 1c. Place phrases and clauses within a sentence, avoiding misplaced and dangling modifiers; 2b. Spell correctly; 3. Choose words and phrases that express ideas concisely, eliminating wordiness and redundancy.
* Grade 8: Writing: 5. With some guidance and support from peers and adults, strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach after rethinking how well questions of purpose and context have been addressed. Language: 1a. Form and use verbs in the active and passive voice; 1c. Recognize and correct inappropriate shifts in verb voice and mood; 2a. Use a comma to separate coordinate adjectives (e.g., It was a fascinating, enjoyable movie but not He wore an old[,] green shirt); 2b. Use a comma, ellipses, or dash to indicate a pause or break; 2c. Spell correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson Time: 60 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If you feel your students would benefit from extra support with grammar and mechanics, spread this lesson out over a few days; students acquiring English, for example, may require added review or even introduction to concepts covered here. To break up the lesson, spend one day on Steps One, Two, and the review portion of Step Three. You can continue work on the review portion of Step Three for as many days as needed, having students complete the worksheet only when you feel they are able to make the corrections successfully. Steps Four and Five can be handled on one additional day or spread out over several days, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT:
1. Proofread their work for sentence structure, grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and spelling.
2. Use proofreading marks to edit their own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* Each student should bring a copy of the first five pages of his or her revised novel; he or she may re-use one of the copies previously marked up by another student if necessary.
* One clean copy of the “Cleaning It Up” worksheet per student. This can also be found on page 96 of the Young Novelist Workbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: Writing Prompt                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell students that, since it’s been a little while since they did any good old-fashioned creative writing, today they will start the lesson with a writing prompt. Have each student take 5 minutes and a blank sheet of paper to describe a time when someone misunderstood what they were saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: What’s the Point?                5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start by congratulating students for having made it this far. Tell them that the hard part of writing and revising a novel is over; the bulk of the work is done. All they have to do now is clean up the finished product so it will sparkle and shine. Explain that proofreading is the absolute last step in writing. They may have been tempted to fix grammar and typos before that, especially when they got stuck writing or revising for the “big picture.” Now that they’ve done all that though, they can fix all those piddly mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may wish to reassure students that the process of proofreading a novel does not generally take as long as the process of thoroughly revising it (which they are likely not done with anyway). Proofreading can take days or even weeks though, since students want to read slowly and catch every mistake. Therefore in this lesson they will focus on proofreading only their first few pages; they can take what they have learned from this activity and apply it to proofreading their whole novels when they are satisfied with their other revisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask students to think of mistakes they have seen in writing, for example on signs, menus, publications, or even in their own writing. Were any of these mistakes confusing or even funny? Then have a few volunteers briefly tell about times others misunderstood what they were saying (their topic for the writing prompt). Help students grasp that mistakes in their novels will distract readers, confuse them, or even amuse them in a bad way—which in turn will make it harder for readers to understand what their novels are about. And it feels lousy to be misunderstood!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Proofread and Correct                30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribute the worksheet to students and read the introduction together. Then have students skim the blurbs about each area of grammar and conventions mentioned. Do students recognize any of these from previous lessons on grammar? It’s likely that they do, especially concepts such as subject-verb agreement, punctuation, and (of course!) dialogue formatting as discussed in Lesson 10. Some of the concepts may be new or particularly challenging, however, and require additional explanation and examples from you. You may have students briefly review what they know about different types of pronouns, for example, and how to identify the proper pronoun form to use. Also, it’s likely that they’ve never been introduced to the concept of “active voice” before. Take time to discuss the trickiest concepts here, basing review on the unique needs of your group and referring to printed resources such as The Little Brown Handbook and The Elements of Style if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next explain that this worksheet is just a guideline for some common errors writers make. Point out that even famous and/or best-selling novelists are guilty of many of these offenses. Fortunately for published authors, they have editors who will point out and mark errors. Your students will have to mark their own errors themselves! Then work through the first exercise with students. Read aloud the blurb and then the sentences:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excitement was sew grate that Heidi couldn’t bear it. They’re was know way to describe the intents anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point to the word grate. Ask students to explain the problem with the use of grate. Then demonstrate on the board how to mark it, by drawing a line through it, adding a caret, and writing the correct word, great, above. Finish correcting the sentences as a group. Then have students complete the rest of the activities independently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Four: Clean It Up                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Say, “Now that you have filled in the worksheet pages with edits to someone else’s work, try it on your own!”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell students that they will have about 10 minutes to proofread and mark up their first five pages. Remind them that this is not the time to make major changes to the story, they should have done that already! Instead, they should focus on fixing mistakes in the writing. Tell students to use the checklist at the end of the worksheet to remind them of the types of errors they should be looking for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Five: Share                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have volunteers share mistakes they found or improvements they made to their pages. You may wish to have some volunteers write sentences they corrected on the board and show how they marked them up. Or have them hold up their work and explain what they did. Provide support and encouragement to students. Tell them that “cleaning up” writing is hard work, and sometimes tedious, but makes an enormous difference in whether people understand what is happening in their novels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may also wish to have students post “Before and After” paragraphs from their novels on a class bulletin board. Other students will benefit from seeing the types of grammatical and conventional edits classmates are making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell students that when they are happy with their "big picture" revisions, they can begin proofreading and correcting their novels. Encourage them to do this in as methodical a manner as possible, ideally marking up entire chapters or even the whole novel on paper, before making edits to electronic files. Students who hand-wrote their novels may input marked corrections when and if they are able to type their work onto a computer. Make sure to check with students in the coming weeks and months to see who is still working on their novels and how the process is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson Plan 18: Getting It Published&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Writing: 4 Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience; 6. Use technology, including the Internet, to produce, publish, and interact with others about writing, including linking to and citing online sources; 10 Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.
* Grade 7: Writing: 4 Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience; 6. Use technology, including the Internet, to produce, publish, and interact with others about writing, including presenting and citing information in a digital format; 10 Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.
* Grade 8: Writing: 4 Produce writing in which the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience; 10 Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Lesson Time: 60 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: This lesson is meant to be completed after students finish “cleaning up” their entire novels and each has a polished, edited manuscript. Depending on the support your class requires, Steps One and Two (“Why Publish?” and “Choosing an Excerpt”) can become one session, with additional time for individual student work and conferencing. In this case, Steps Three and Four (“Writing a Submission Letter” and “Where to Send It”) could become a second session, with opportunities for supplemental teacher support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objectives: By the end of this lesson, SWBAT:
1. Select appropriate excerpts from their novels to be submitted to literary magazines and journals.
2. Write a simple submission letter addressed to an editor.
3. Research possible publishing resources using the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* Each student should have a copy his or her polished, edited manuscript.
* Copies of the “Choosing an Exceptional Excerpt” and “Writing a Superior Submission Letter” worksheets.
* The "Places to Submit Work" section of the YWP Helpful Links page.
* If possible, hard copies of a student literary journal or two, or display websites for these journals if hard copies are not available.
* Paperclips, Post-it notes, and flags&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step One: Why Publish?                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Congratulate students on finishing the process of “cleaning up” their manuscripts. Note that this may have been a long process, but you know it was worthwhile to let their work shine. Transition: “Now that you have let your ‘inner editor’ loose on your novel, it’s time to let your novel loose on the world, and think about how you can find a larger audience for your excellent work.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announce the brainstorming question: “Why would we want to publish our novels?” (This can also be copied on the board, for differentiation for visual learners.) Ensure that the class understands the meaning of the word “publish,” and give students about 3 minutes to quietly record ideas their ideas in writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once time is up, invite students to discuss their notes on the brainstorming question. Students can simply share answers orally or you (or a student scribe) can take notes on the board. Possible ideas include: “because we’re proud of our work,” “because then everyone can read it,” “because that’s the first step to getting famous!,” and so on. Note that all are excellent reasons to publish a novel, and that today’s activities are designed to help begin the publishing process by demonstrating how to apply for publication in a literary journal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: Where to Send It                10 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display any hard copies or websites of literary journals appropriate for middle school students. If you don’t have access to these, simply have students share what they know about literary journals. Encourage students to briefly discuss who the main audience of each journal is. Then help them notice that the pieces in each journal are all short, and speculate about why this is so. Explain that in order to get published in journals like these, students must pick short excerpts of their novels. They will literally have to chop their novels apart! If you detect any grumbling about this, point out that every publication on earth has its set format, so adapting one’s writing to new formats is always part of getting published!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call students’ attention to the "Places to Submit Work" section of the YWP Helpful Links page. You might assign this for homework the night before, have students look at it individually if you are in a computer lab, or display it on a classroom overhead. Give students some time to think about which publications they might like to submit their writing to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Two: Choosing an Excerpt                20 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell students that now that they know where they might like to get published, they’re ready to choose excerpts suitable for those publications. Begin this process by having them look at the “Choosing an Exceptional Excerpt” worksheet. Read through the “CALLS” (Character / Action / Language / Length / Stands on its own) method for choosing an excerpt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give students time to brainstorm possible excerpts to use, with the CALLS method as a framework. Encourage them to flip through their manuscript to jog their memories and take notes. You might also provide paperclips, Post-it notes, and flags for them to mark sections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optional (if spreading the lesson out over two sessions): Have each student work with another classmate who is familiar with his or her novel (e.g., an editing partner) to check for effective excerpts. You can also make time for individual conferences for students who are stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step Three: Writing the Submission Letter                20 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transition: “You have hopefully chosen a great excerpt that your chosen publication will be happy to print. The next step is to write a submission letter—a brief note to an editor or publisher giving background on you and your novel..” Then, as a group, take turns reading sections from the first two pages of “Writing a Superior Submission Letter.” Help students identify each important element of the model letter as described on the first page of the worksheet and talk about how it “works” in the letter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow students time to begin drafting their submission letters according to the outline provided on the third page. If students finish before time is up, tell them to edit and proofread their letters using the revision skills they learned in previous lessons!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close the lesson by telling students: “Today, we have discussed the tools you need to submit part of your novel to be published. You have chosen appropriate publications for your writing, selected excerpts, and begun your submission letters. Your homework is to bring all that together!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For homework, students should finalize the excerpts they wish to submit for publication and complete their submission letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow-Up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In subsequent lessons, you might check excerpts, work with the class on improving and proofreading submission letters, and discuss the logistics of submitting work (postage, e-mail attachments, etc.). You might also work with any students who are particularly enthusiastic, or whose work is particularly polished, to identify book publishers or literary agents they might submit their completed novels to. Students may research online or at the nearest library to learn about book publishers and literary agents. Fortunately, the initial process for submitting to a publisher or agent is very similar to that of submitting to a journal—except students’ submission letters should explain that they wish to have their novels published in their entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making NaNoWriMo Classroom Anthologies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supports Common Core Standards for English Language Arts:
* Grade 6: Writing: 6. Use technology, including the Internet, to produce, publish, and interact with others about writing, including linking to and citing online sources.
* Grade 7: Writing: 6. Use technology, including the Internet, to produce, publish, and interact with others about writing, including linking to and citing online sources.
* Grade 8: Writing: 6. Use technology, including the Internet, to produce, publish, and interact with others about writing, including presenting and citing information in a digital format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your class has put in a month of hard work. Why not give them something they can show off? Consider creating a NaNoWriMo anthology with your class, featuring excerpts from each student, author pictures, student reflections about their NaNoWriMo experience, and much more. Below you will find all the elements that make up a great anthology!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* Book-making supplies: These materials can be as simple or as elaborate as you like. Your school district may have access to software that can be used to make something more professional-looking. If you do not have access to computers, you can also use scissors, a stapler, and a copy machine just as well. You may also approach local copiers to see if they would be willing to donate printing services or offer you a discount.
* You can also use CreateSpace to design and self-publish the anthology.
* A digital or film camera to take author photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Elements of a Great NaNoWriMo Classroom Anthology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Title and Cover&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A title is an important thing for any anthology because it sets the tone for the work inside. Sure, you could go with Mrs. Smith’s Seventh Grade Class NaNoWriMo Anthology, but wouldn’t something like The Raging Writers be more fun? You could look for cool lines from the kids’ excerpts and pick one, or you could let them come up with titles in class and vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take the time to make a book cover, the book will appear that much more “real.” You can design it yourself or you can host a “Book Cover Contest” in your classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tables of Contents and Mastheads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget the little things that make your book look professional. A table of contents and page numbering system will allow proud parents to find their child’s story easily.
Also, if the kids are helping produce the anthology by doing things such as editing, providing illustrations, etc., take a bit of space to recognize this. In professional magazines, there is a box called a “masthead” near the front of each issue that lists staff and contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple ways you can do this. One is by making this a “First Chapter Anthology,” meaning every student could revise and turn in their first chapters, or the first 3–10 pages, depending on grade level, classroom size, and the size of your printing budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students can also choose a favorite excerpt based on the “CALLS” method in Lesson 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter which pages students select for their excerpts, however, one thing is essential: each excerpt must include a title and the author’s name, and have been proofread very, very carefully. If students use the first few pages of their novels, proofreading will likely have been completed during Lesson 17. If they choose a different set of pages, however, these may need to be proofread for the first time. Remind students how to do this by correcting for subject-verb agreement, verb tense, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation and by combining sentences whenever possible. If needed, refer them back to the Lesson 17 worksheet for specific tips on what to look for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to arrange the stories in your anthology is alphabetically, by author’s last name. That way, everything is as fair and equal as possible. However, if the kids are editing, you might have them pick a number of stories that exemplify certain qualities (best female protagonist, best use of imagery, etc.), and recognize these at the front of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also look for a “flow” from one story to the next. It’s hard to explain, but once you start reading the stories and arranging them, there may be an order that just feels right, possibly even
one that creates a feeling of something bigger than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extra Cool Things That Will Make Your Students Feel Like Real Authors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can enhance the authorial feel by giving each student the full-feature treatment:
1. Have each student write an author bio. This could be a real bio, or a fictional one. If they want this NaNo-novel to be recognized as their fifth best-seller, that’s great!
2. Include an author photo, preferably with the student looking very serious and authorial. You may want to bring in some props, like large quills, busts of Shakespeare, typewriters, etc.
3. Write a bit of praise for each student’s novel. Something like, "A must read. James is a genius when it comes to ninjas."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General Notes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For students relatively new to the writing process, focus on praise and encouragement rather than editing. The word counts here may be low enough that you will be able to include each student's entire novel in this anthology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encourage kids to illustrate their stories for the anthology with their own artwork.
In any case, remember that the anthology is a celebration of your students’ work in November. It deserves to look wonderful and to find an honored place in your classroom!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also keep in mind that some students will continue to work on their novels even after the project is over, or may even start new novels on their own! Consider checking back in with the group periodically to see who’s still writing. For those who get their novels to a stage they feel is final, encourage them with ideas of how to find audiences for their work by entering it contests, submitting it to children’s literary magazines, and more. See our Helpful Links page for suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting a NaNo-Reading&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials:
* Each student should select a short excerpt from his or her novel to practice reading aloud, about 3 pages. If students have trouble selecting excerpts, encourage them to select the beginning pages of their novels or those included in the Classroom Anthology, since these will be the most polished. All students must choose excerpts even if they do not plan to read at the Author’s Chair event.
* For the reading, a podium with microphone.
* Copies of the Classroom Anthology for purchase by family and community members, if desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting a reading where students can read short excerpts from their novels aloud is the best way to celebrate your students’ new works of fiction. Depending on your group, not all students will want to read or will even be able to read due to time constraints. However, all students can practice their speaking skills by preparing for the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preparation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once students have finished editing and proofreading their novels and have selected the excerpts they would like to share, have them practice reading their excerpts aloud with partners. You should give them around 20-30 minutes to do this. Before beginning, though, discuss the following speaking tips with them. We suggest that you write these points on the board or on a transparency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select an appropriate tone of voice and practice it. If you speak too loudly, audience members may get intimidated or irritated. If you speak too quietly, people will not be able to hear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read at the right speed. People tend to read too quickly when they are nervous, but this can make the words hard to understand. Take your time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust your voice according to the punctuation used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use your voice to show what is happening in the story. If a character is excited, speak with excitement! If the mood is dark, speak more slowly and perhaps with a deeper voice. This will help listeners understand the mood of your writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to look listeners in the eye once in a while. Also use gestures and body language. This helps hold the listener's interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once students have practiced reading their excerpts aloud for partners a few times, invite their feedback on the process. Did they learn anything about good speaking by listening to their partners read aloud? Was it hard to read at the right speed and volume? Students will also be amazed at how many mistakes they find in their writing—or just things they’d like to change—when they are forced to read it aloud!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selecting Students to Read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that some of your students will not want to share their novels at the reading. It’s also likely, given the size of your group, that you won’t have time for all students to read anyway. Work with the group as a whole to set criteria for who will read, emphasizing that the NaNo-Reading is not meant to highlight any student's writing as “better” or "more special” than any other’s, only to give those who want to an opportunity to read in front of a big audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosting the Event!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="either-host-the-event-in-your-classroom-during-school-hours-or-possibly-host-one-after-school-so-your-students-families-can-come-bask-in-the-glory-of-their-young-novelists-if-you-have-the-time-and-energy-call-your-local-independent-bookstores-to-see-if-you-can-host-a-reading-at-one-of-them-let-them-know-too-that-it-will-be-beneficial-to-them-you-will-be-bringing-in-a-crowd-of-people-who-inspired-by-a-month-of-noveling-will-want-to-buy-books"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LETS SPRINT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organise the Open Educational Resource
Sprints 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are getting a critical mass of schools with Creative Commons policies, enabling teachers to legally share and
collaborate. This is good news, of course,
but the risk is that the policy becomes just
a piece of paper, to which no one really
pays all that much attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites/resources etc should be clearly state the work is under a Creative Common
licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show how kiwi teachers can work together to
make new, open resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's a sprint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An idea borrowed from the technology sector,
where it is sometimes called a hack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The GovHack' weekends are one example of technologists, designers and a range of
other volunteers coming together to make new
products and services from open government
data and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example that inspired us was the Media
Text Hack, a team of educators and
researchers got together to write an open
Media Studies textbook. It's now an assigned
undergraduate textbook at the University of
Otago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other example was the Oppikirjamaraton
(Finnish for - textbook marathon). This event
involved about thirty Finnish mathematics
educators writing a new textbook for schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These events give us working models of how
an OER Sprint might work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organising teams have been open about the
problems they had during the event and what
they would do differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At tech conferences sprinting is often used
an event where people work towards a goal -
often bugfixes in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DECISIONS, DECISIONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still details about the event to figure out.
Opened up the process early, everyone can
see how decisions are being made. In the end,
we will have a model that schools,
associations and informal groups of teachers
can use to sprint - or hack - their way to
the resources they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do we need to think about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be reflecting on these issues over the next few months - both here at
NZCommons and in our open Loomio group, with
other volunteer organisers. But here's a few
to get us started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long should it last for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sprints last for two days, others just
one. Some sprints keep strict,
family-friendly time-frames, while others
keep working deep into the night. We ought to keep it short and sweet i.e a busy
9/10-5 - for either one or two days, though
with an expectation than many participants
won't be able to commit for the full period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology the bane of many such events.
We'll need to find a technical platform that
works for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial thinking is that Google Docs
will work fine for small teams, and is a
technology many teachers already use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bigger projects with many more
collaborators  have had issues with using
Google Docs, and more technical platforms
like Github have also been problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants, volunteers and facilitators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be a two day event. Saturday and
Sunday are usually good. There is the idea
of opening the conference on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What skills do we need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the best mix of practising teachers, non-teaching subject-area experts
(like academics), facilitators and other
volunteers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the focus of the event as by
teachers, for teachers, with other volunteers
serving to support the needs of the
participants teachers. At the same time, we
want to take advantage of the collective
expertise of everyone who wants to help out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's a resource?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other sprints have focused on making single book (or book-like entity). My feeling
is that a resource is whatever the heck
participants decide to make on the day,
and that this should be the decision of each
individual team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team formation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what constitutes a team? How many people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3-6 seems about right, though I'm not sure
about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about virtual participation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we're working on Google docs, this is
fine though virtual collaboration
can breed those dreaded Technological
Problems, which well want to avoid. But we
shouldn't put any barriers
on people participating, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will the events actually look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will involve people sitting at tables,
talking and typing. Minimise
the amount of scene-setting at the
beginning, and look to have a plethora of
helpers to solve problems as they arise.
This will involve giving clear guidance
beforehand. A minor amount of faffing about
at the beginning is probably unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much does it cost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our point of view, there are two sorts
of costs: event costs; and outreach costs,
before and after the event. For the event,
we'll need funding or in-kind sponsorship
to cover food, drink, venue, technology and
other incidental costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the outreach, we'll need funding to get
resources on CC and OER to as many teachers
as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, how many events?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were not sure, yet, though before the end
of the year, we should make some initial
committments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keen to have them anywhere and everywhere,
though this will depend on us getting strong
local support.&lt;/p&gt;

His art can be found at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://artcontrol.me/"&gt;http://artcontrol.me/&lt;/a&gt; and is available under a
Creative Commons Attribution (BY) licence. William is also a supporter and user of open source software, and is passionate about
early childhood education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I use Creative Commons as an artist in the hope that it helps promote my artwork, and to make the world a better place," says William.
"Others may find uses for my art and even make money from it, good on them!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William seriously became interested in drawing after leaving high school and attending UCOL in Palmerston North.
There he had a drawing tutor, Mark, who inspired him to keep a drawing journal. William gained the habit of carrying a sketchbook wherever
he goes, along with a pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his time at Palmerston North School of Design, William created the site artcontrol.me: The Art Of William Mckee.
It was hosted with GoDaddy and ran CentOS. The site was powered by WordPress, switching later to Nikola.
He later also switched this to DigitalOcean with the operating system Debian, which is used by the majority of his machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While William was always interested in using a Creative Commons licence, he at first chose to use a more restrictive
Attribution-NonCommercial (BY-NC) licence for his artworks, though soon chose to use the liberal Attribution (BY) licence.
William doesn't see many reasons for artists to use NC licences, and finds it especially problematic when NC licensing is used by governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As William argues, "Tax payers have already paid for the material. It should therefore be licensed under the most liberal licences
(perhaps even public domain/creativecommons zero). This allows the most freedom for people to do what they like with the content."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William also point out that the "Non-Commercial licences are hard to interpret, as was noted in a German court case in 2014,
which strongly limited the interpretation of NC to 'personal use.' Similar problems with the interpretation of NC could exist
in other countries. This is why I think government - and everyone, in fact - should avoid the NC licence.
I would actually prefer that the NC licence not exist in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing, Williams says, is that the majority of New Zealand government works released under CC seems to be under CC BY,
though he is concerned that some schools seem to have adopted an NC licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended The Learning Connexion, where he began to focus on life drawing, using GIMP,
an open source drawing and design tool. William began by painting on a windows desktop and laptop, later switching to
Fedora and Debian. Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait and figures were drawn from references on RedditGetsDrawn.
During this period, William would draw portraits of people and give them the drawing - taking a photo for his own reference.
At the bottom of the page he would sign with wcmckee artcontrol.me and write 'cc by' on the piece of original artwork.
These were mostly completely in pencil and coloured pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William is also passionate about working with children. In 2014 he volunteered at Whaihanga Early Learning Centre,
where he would work collaboratively with kids, often on the same piece of art, using oil pastel, pencil, and coloured pencil.
He was very influenced by the children's drawings - often redrawing elements of their works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William took the liberty of licensing these works under a CC BY licence - photographing and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me.
He would create large chalk murals on the ground outside, with children requested that he draw comic book characters like the Hulk,
Spiderman, Bane, and Batman. These mural pieces were created on the fenceline of Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School. Swarms of
school children would crowd the fenceline - watching and discussing the artwork with him. They were often blown away from how quickly he worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A hope of mine," William says, "was the children would learn that art was about sharing and remixing - something Creative Commons has at its core."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William has since become a volunteer for Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, helping to spread the word about Creative Commons licensing in
the Hamilton region. If you want to volunteer, get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

wondered. She watches as Antony hands
Detective a device. Then the footage stops.
'Damn it', Vanessa curses.
Something happens that causes all the
eletronic devices in the area to stop
working. What they have created is a kill
switch, even if they don't relize it.
Vanessa stood up from her chair.
The camera footage from now is useless.
She needs to find out what that substance was
and how it brought Detective back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective agreed to the tasks that Antony
had shown him on the paper. He didn't
agree with them - they involved either
killing or hurting innocent people - people
that had no idea about their effect or
generations after them effect on society.
Steering at the list of names, dates and
times, and event almost brought him to
tears. He had to hold back his emotions.
If Antony had any idea that he was fully
consisious then he would be destoried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa had finished researching on the
substance that Antony injected into
Detectives brain - bringing him back to life.
She stood in his surgery room. This was a
hidden room in the palact that had a bunch
of terminal computers and a table for
performing surgerys. There was suspession
of something like this - but this was
horrific. Humans had been going missing and
Vanessa had just worked out what was
happening - Antony was capturing them and
performing surgery on them. He was using the
computers along with the traditinal medical
aplications. Vanessa had found evidence that
Antony was spicing DNA - mixing alien and
human genes together to create monsters like
himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6b345 and Blitz had been assisting Antony in
the lab. 6b345 had been riped to pieces when
they spaceship blew up entering the Earth
atmosphere. Bliz had died in the accident.
Vanessa had set the explosives on their ship
to explode when it entered the Earths
atmosphere. She hadn't expected it to blow
up over the building that she was attempting
to smuggle Joey out of - leading to a quick
escape.  It happened though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI Robot originally created to make art and
a cat mixed with Antonys human and alien
genes. The strangest of lab assistences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the wall was a framed painting of
Loth'Rak. Vanessa could reconise him. Antony
looked very similar to him. Antony had more
human features though. Loth'Rak was a
full alien, well Antony was only half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have they been talking about Vanessa, Antony,
and Detective too much with the focus taken
away from some other major events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to Sarah in the NASA testing
room. They were preping for the Moon blast.
The humans knew it was coming. When Detective
was sent back by Antony for the first time in
order to attempt to save Antony from being
driven out of Mars by Vanessa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6b345 changes a file that he finds on Mars so
that the robot uprising happens. This begins
when 6b345 finds a red usb on mars. It
contains the system details for the artcontrol
AI system that was developed to create art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference that Vanessa attended on Earth
was the Open Education Resource 2860. It was
organized by robots. They created open
education resources every day that were used
in teaching of the Humans on Mars.
Vanessa shows up and messys everything up
with crashing 6b345 and Blitz into the
building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need to write Blitz version of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blitz was born on 6 August 3555. The dust
on Mars were partickly bad that day. Antony
had created Blitz in the lab. He had mixed
cat, human, and his own human and alien gene
dna systems. It was the same process that
Loth'Rak used on a human and his alien genes.
Antony had memories from his Father and could
access all the skills that Loth'Rak posisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blitz had a speech impediment noticed by
Antony shortley after he created him. The
experiment created an alien like voice box
that became mutated by a virus that
contamanted the system. It lead to a bomb
being set by Vanessa inside of Blirz, leading
to their ship being burnt when entering the
Earths atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blitz strided down the road. She enjoying the
rain. On Mars it never rained but she had
seen photographs and diagrams of how rain
works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body of Blitz was cat-like but she had
two human arms coming out of the bottom of
her neck. Along with four cat like legs she
was a highly productive, agile, and super
creature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prototypes of Blitz had failed. Antony
had tried to create a mixture of his and a
animals genes for years. Each experiment
being a fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6b345 had been a great assist to the creation
of Blitz. Whenever Antony was in the lab he
6b345 was there with him to assist in the
experiments. They went through attempts of
mixing human and Antonys genes but failed.
They were using sick citizens on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony had poisoned the Human race that meant
they were unable to use the time shift device
The files that are on the red USB active the
AI system TechFuncMasters virus. It leads to
the death of all the humans on Earth. Humans
were sent to Mars in order to presurve mankind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story about a series of events that
are attempted to be manipilated by a time
traveler. The effects are grave and
unexpected where multi timelines
cross over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story focuses on a red usb that contains
a private key. It follows a series of differnt
and altenative events around this red usb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy the time you spend reading
it. It was created for NaNoWriMo 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the second attempt to write a novel
for NanoWriMo. The account has been active
since 2011. Only novels in 2013, 2014, and
2015 were created. In 2014 the novel
SpikeInfoSec was started. The total word count
was only around 7000 words. It was writen on
a raspberry pi computer using a IPython
Notebook in Markdown format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injection had lead to sores begin to cover
Detectives skin. Antony watched as his skin
became red and infected. He tried to use
substances to counter the effect but every
day it just got worse.
Detective had been in the coma for 3 years.
3 years of his brain switched off in this time
and active in others. When he traveled he would
of taken the time split device with him,
leading to switch between times as he saw fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015 for NaNoWriMo the novel
ItWillNotBeMine was created. With a goal of
1666 words per day. On day one and seven over
2900 words were written. The majority of days
over 1666 words were written. There were
several days when less than 1000 wc, these
were disapointing days but motivation to
increase the count the following days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel was writen on a HP Chromebook
with ChromeOS. It was typed in a Debian
Linux chroot on the Chromebook. It was
also typed on a Raspberry Pi computer with a
tft screen. On both of these devices,
terminal was used with the text editor nano.
For some of the days a Windows 7 computer
was used and software Notepad++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end a novel was created. It was 50,000
words, science fiction, a rough draft. I
published it to the Writers Den Hamilton site
as I wrote it. It's licenced under a Creative
Commons BY 4.0 licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to NaNoWriMo for the event,
Waikato NaNoWriMo, Writers Den Hamilton,
Hamilton Computer Club, Creative Commons New
Zealand and my family and friends for support
and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel is reaching 40,000 words and
decisions need to be made for the final days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No point worring about the structure. Work on
cleaning up plots and altenative perspectives
on events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the word count is reached the machine
gets to sleep. They have a certain word count
to make a day. How do they measure editing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robots just type files and the computer
builds the site and uploads the changes to
the webserver. Billions of words a day are
created. The robots are not told what to write
but instead just choose on what to write by
analizing data. This leads to more happy and
productive robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they were building the robots they relized
that if you made them sad they were less
productive. Telling them what to do was the
main thing that made them sad the data showed.
They fixed this by no longer telling the
robots what to do but instead let them sprint
freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey loved to sprint. His robot of course
loved it as well. The robot would show up
at the conference enter at 8am sharp, 7
days a week. They would then sprint for the
day - creating mostly Open Education
Resources. They were free to create whatever
they wanted though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novel is licenced under a Creative
Commons BY 4.0 licence.
I like this licence as it is free culture.
Many seem to obsessed with putting work under
a NC licence. Take a giant leap and don't
licence under NC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can only see people doing great stuff with
anything created. It's exciting see what
people might do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need to go through some of the older works
and find events and plots that need a cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write down the character and all the events,
times and suitrations that the character is
involved with - from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it epic and make it now. Let's get this
finished. The last few days should be a good
mofivater to get it finished. I will likely
have a burst to 50,000. Once I hit that I
will be done. I would like to start editing.
Maybe remixing each chapter as a new blog
post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking posts on nzcommons and reusing them
on WrtiersDenHamilton. Remixing them. Great
pratice to edit work. This is going to get
my over the wordcount!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa had taken a small ship from storage and attempt to locate Antonys ship. From her calcalations she has a rough idea where the ship could be
She was able access GPS days from the ships camera before the footage stopped. Vanessa marched up the ramp. She had decided to bring Joey on the
trip with her. Vanessa was impressed with how much of a hand it was once she actived it. Joey could be a help if she locates Antonys ship.
The ship took off with Vanessa on it leaving Mars atmophere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antonys head hurt. The visions of multi time lines were apearing again. He was running low on the substance to opress them. Detecive was still
straped to the chair. His body full of life but his mind in another time. Antony reached for the supply cubbard and pulled out a capsure of the
substance. He needed the injection, the visions were becoming too unbearable. He placed the capsure into a clean needled and injected it into his
arm. The visions imedicatly stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blitz was licking Sarahs blood off the ground on Mars when she was shot in the head by Antony. The causes a glitch in the timelines. When Sarah was
shot in the head it causes Blitz to be warped to another timeline where Joey notices him as he is walking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey and Sarah walked down the dark and gloomy road. They arms were interlocked. In the distance they could see a shape that looked like a cat. The
two headed closer towards the shape. It was unusal for there to be other lifeforms out in public. As they got closer to the figure they knew something
was wrong. The cat had mutated or something. Out the side of it's next were two long human arms. Sarah vomited. The creature skretched and ran off.
'What the hell has happened here,' Sarah asked Joey, spiting the vomit from her mouth. 'I think that man Dectective is changing the events', Joey
said. 'Uganka was spose to let us and we would use the time split device,' he continued to expain. 'I have no idea what we do now, we may be able
to still active the time split device. Just because we didn't activate it then doesn't mean it won't,' Joey paused to let Sarah finish coughing,
'Are you OK?,' he asked, concerned for the coughing fit that Sarah had gotten herself into. The creature had stopped skretching and ran off into
the dark. Joey moved up to where it was standing, licking something on the ground. He debed his finger into the substance. It was a rich red.
Human blood. 'What would human blood be doing here?' Joey wondered. 'This is most unusal', he thought. Sarah had finished her coughing fit.
'What do we have here', She asked Joey. 'It seems to be human blood,' Joey explained, moving a sample of the blood into a container for analize
back at the lab. 'Human blood!', Sarahs jaw dropped. She bend down and had a close look at the puddle on the ground. 'And this cat creature was
drinking this? Why?', Sarah asked. 'I have no idea but there is something crazy happening here', Joey replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blitz siped the blood that had been left on the floor when Antony shot Sarah. She looked around. Everything had changed. She relized that he was no
longer on Mars. From what it looked like - she was on what looked Earth. Blitz had never been to Earth. She had been created in Antonys lab on Mars.
Antony had shown her images of Earth. Blitz was part human and cat felling a strong connection to Earth. Blitz froze when she saw two figure
approch. Who were these people? she thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day22.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 21 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>meeting-2015-12-02</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/meeting-2015-12-02.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi fellow scribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a big group at the last Writers Den meeting. Welcome to Sachi, Selena and Kaleah. It is fantastic that the Den is gaining in support and reputation as being a breeding ground for emerging writers. A place to hone your skills and hang-out with other cool writers. (if you weren't there, we still missed you!!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time to close the group to new members again, for now.  Time to settle, hunker down and work on the writing craft. I would like to see a return to writing exercises, going back to setting, characterisation, plot etc, especially for the newer members and as a refresher for the long-termers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about craft, the homework challenge was to write dialogue and this created useful discussion, critique and chortling (the latter due largely to the candid humour of Jeff and Terry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike, from the group, has offered to hold Sunday meetings at his place, but this has yet to be finalised (how, when, where, what, who), so there will be an update to come on this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William is also developing our own website, so that will be a fantastic way to keep connected, share information, and let the rest of the cyberworld know creative writing is alive and flourishing in Hamilton, New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ielse has kindly offered to take up the communications side of things, emails and updates etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure there will be a couple of writers who will be confident in co-ordinating and facilitating meetings after the next session on the 2nd of December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also been in contact with Lisa Pritchard, to let her know what is going on, and I am hoping she will be able to come along to one of the meetings to meet everyone and give us a little knee up to put some of our writing on the Hamilton City Library website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEXT MEETING 2ND DECEMBER.
1.  Homework challenge: BELIEVE IT OR NOT. Or in literary terms, 'the suspension of disbelief' (Google the term, if you are unsure). Write about 500 words, making the extraordinary seem believable, a tall tale. For example, giving your boss an excuse why you were 'sick'. You can probably think of a better idea, There is usually a series of complications (and then...and then...and then...). Can you please bring along some copies for shared critique, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release the creativity. Sachi has kindly volunteered to give us a short exercise on creativity. (We look forward to that, Sachi!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeff Taylor (Master of Flash) has offered to give a brief presentation on entering competition, covering how to present your work, what the judges are looking for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in Progress. If you need feedback or input on a particular area of any work in progress, your peers will give you honest and valuable critique to help you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last meeting for the year will be on the 16th of December. (I will be with you in spirit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't wish to continue receiving these emails, let me know and I will take you off the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you then
Kind regards
Shona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>information</category><category>meeting</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/meeting-2015-12-02.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 21 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>nanowrimo15-day21</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day21.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detectives eyes opened. 'Where am I', he though. Standing over him was a strange looking part-human, part-alien creature. Something had changed. He
knew something was terriblely wrong. Straps were holding his arms and legs. He was unable to move. The lightbulb light flickered. The creature stood
over him with a wicked grin. He seld two skelpes in 2 of his hands. The other two arms holding other equipment. Detective splatted 'hello' from his
mouth. The creature mutted some words at Detective which he understood barely. He gets asked about his most recent breakfast. He sees visions of
eggs on breakfast, watching the broadcast on the television and the protesters outside. Then darkness. His next memories were waking up here with
Antony standing over him, cutting his head open. Antony had injected something into his system. His body felt different, and it wasn't just the
open brain surgery. Antony questioned him, pretending to be nice. Detective lied his way through the questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event that just took place was onboard a ship traveling through unknown space with its engines switched off. It involved two main characters of
the story. Everything is one big cycle. Whatever happens, happens. If you attempt to change it, it will fail.
Detective is sent back to where he
wakes to a world inhabited by humans. The humans find the alien dna in his brain leading to extraction and development of ai systems. It is here
where he begins to experience multipy timelines. At some point there was a hickup with the timelines, causing characters to experience multi
timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major different timelines. The first - when humans kill Loth'Raks planet, leading to Antony killing human race. The 2nd - when
robots kill the human race, stops the attack on Loth'Raks planet and Loth'Rak ends up destoring his own planet. What ever they attempt to do they
are unable to save Earth. The novel takes place over a long period of time. The characters consiste of generations and robots that live forever.
When Antony sent the first person back with the time slipt device - Detective humans find him and extract the metal out of his brain and duplaict
the metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a ever lasting circle. When will it stop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa had tracked Antonys ship to just outside of Mars atomsphere. From the footage she was watching of the ship it had switched off it's engines
and was drifting through space. She was able to access the CCTV onboard the ship. The achieve of the ships footage was all there. She was able to
view all the ships footage of when Antony had boarded the ship on Mars, taken off, and now floating through space. Vanessa started the footage from
the start, from when Antony board the ship. The camera she was viewing was inside the ship, pointing towards the entry to the ship. Vanessa watched
the footage of the door to the ship opened. Antony stepped into the ship with the body of Detective. She switched cameras - allowing her to see him
dump the body onto a chair and strap it in. Antony rushed quickly to the ships controls - starting the engine up and taking off. Camera footage
showed Antony at the wheel of the ship steering the ship. Once he has left Mars he switches off the ship and gets up off the control seat.
The footage shows him moving towards the body he has on the ship and perform brain surgery on the body - injecting the body with some sort of
substance. Vanessa needed to find out what this was. She continued to watch the footage of the brain surgery taking place, despite being discusted
by the footage. It showed Detectives forehead being cut into, and around the side/back. Antony removes the scalp and using a needle - pokes it into
the brain injected some substance.
Antony sews the scalp back up. The footage shows detectives eyes open when he has completed this. Vanessa studies the footage carefully. 'Does that
make him a zombie?,' she considers. Detective was a dead corpse. Injecting him with this substance gave him life. Maybe he's not the same person he
was when he died? But then again - maybe he will be the same. What happened next was the strangest thing. The footage shows Antony and Detective
chatting. Antony is seen scrampling around the room - organising something. He looks like hes in a rush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day21.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>nanowrimo15-day20</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day20.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antony rushed down the secret entry of the building. As he made his way he could hear a voice booming out the front of the building.
The voice was distorted but it sounded like a females voice. It must be Vanessa, Antony thought to himself. A grin came over his face.
She will have no idea what I'm about to do. He reached the end of the corodoor. To get to the next area he needed to set off the dynomite
that was strapped to the wall. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a lighter. He procided to light the dynomite. Antony took serveral
steps back. The blast exposed a civilians lounge. Three figures were in the room. Two male and one female. The female collabsed in shock. One
of the males got down on his hands and knees and started to worship Antony. The usual treatment he got. The third was on the ground - looking
quite lifeless. Antony stepped forward, towards the man on the floor. With two of his arms Antony picked the man up and headed towards the kitchen.
Once in the kitchen he was able to activate a button that opened up a staircase below. He made his way down. He moved quickly but carefully, holding
the body as he took steps. He reached the bottom of the steps. In front of him lay a ship. Antony pressed the green button and the ramp came down
along with the door sliding open. He made his way up the ramp and into the ship, closing the door after him.  The ship was dim. Antony switched on
the lights and procided towards the crew desk. He dumped the body onto a chair. He needed to take off now. He started the ships engines up. The
protesters and Vanessa would hear him taking off, but it's too late. Using the controller he lifted the ship up off the ground. It hovered for a
moment before being thrust forward. He took off leaving Mars. Looking out the window below he could see the mob group of people watching him
take off from the surface. Antony wasn't sure what to do. He decided to just drift in space for now. Once he was far away from Mars that Vanessa
wouldn't be able to find him, he switched off the ships engines. Antony drifted through empty space. He was not happy with the result. Could he
change any of the events that took place? He did not approve of Vanessa and Joey releasing the footage, he wanted to chage that. Antony had the
time split device. He decided that he would use the person that he captured and send him back to change effects. The body was still lifeless. He
needed to bring it back to life. He lifted the body up from the chair and took it into the medical surgery room. Antony would need to perform open
brain surgery on the person, injecting in some of Antonys dna into the brain. This would interlink the two and create a super human.
He placed the body on the table and reached for the skelpel on the table. He had never performed open brain surgery so Antony was quite nervous.
Antony started to cut into the forehead. Blood squarted out at Antony. He wiped it from his face. 'Perhaps a mask might help', he thought, searching
through the cubard for a surgery mask. There was one. It was a dusty but he wiped it off and placed it on his face. He moved back to the body of the
table. The splatter wouldn't get on his face now, instead on the mask.  Antony continued to cut into forehead around into the side and back. He was
able to pull off the area now and access the brain. He took a needle and injected the brain with his DNA. The substance traveled from the brain and
into the rest of the body. Antony started to sew the brain back together. Just as he finished the sewing the persons eyes opened. Antony jumped back.
'Hi there', the person spoke. Antony was shocked that the substance worked so quickly. 'Hi, Im Antony', he spoke, holding out his hand. The person
held their hand out and shook Antonys hand. 'I'm Detective, nice to meet you', shacking Antonys hand. Clearly Detective was delisional, he had no
idea who Antony was. Open brain surgery might do this to someone. At least he seems to know who he is. Antony continued to question him. 'So what was
the last thing you remember', Antony asked Detective. 'I remember eating breakfast with my Mother and Father. Mother had made me eggs', Detective
explained. 'And what date was this?', Antony questioned. Detecive continued, giving Antony the date that they had left Mars. It seemed like he
couldn't remember the television broadcast. This was good, Antony didn't want Detective remembering the television broadcast and the riots.
Antony started with his lie. 'Detective I have some terrible news for you, Im afraid to say that you and me are the only two remainding lifeforms
left from Mars. Shortly after you had breakfast there was an attack on the Human population, you blacked out', Antony told him. Detective listened
in horror at the story. 'I'm afraid you and me were the only two to escape. As I was evactaling the palace I came accross you and loaded you onto
the ship', Antony finished his story. 'And then you woke up here'. Detective didn't know what to say. They only two remaining lifeforms. 'Do you have
a plan?', Detecitve asked Antony. 'As a matter of fact I do', replied Antony. He had thought for sometime on the plan for Detective. Kidnaping him
when he left Mars had worked out well. 'I am going to send you back in time with this', Antony announced, holding up the time split device to
Detective. Antony held up the time split device. Detective reached out to grab it. 'Careful now', Antony said as he pulled it back from Detectives
grasp. 'This is a dangerous device if used incorrectly'. Detective steered at the device, captavated by it. 'What we need is a plan for when you
go back, I've written you up a list of tasks', Antony explained. He pulled out a list and handed to Antony. 'You want me to killed these people',
Detective asked. 'That is correct', Antony said with a smile. 'If you are sucessful, all this will change, you will be reunited with your family.
Detective nodded. 'Fantastic!', Antony stood up. 'We should get started with the prep straight away'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa had driven Antony from Mars. She wasn't happy though. She felt uneasy that he had a ship and was out in space, free. A monster so
corupt should never be free. Vanessa watched the ship disapear from view. Her first plan was to talk to the family of Detective who was on
the ship with Antony. They had done a head count of all humans on Mars, Detective was the only human missing.
Vanessa stepped into the apartment building. The police had taken Detectives parents and they were being held for questioning on what
happened. Vanessa was at the families apartment building. She wanted to get a sense on what happened here before talking to Detectives Mother
and Father. She walked down the hallway. It lead to the lounge. The lounge was a mess. The whole wall had been burst in. From the looks of
it dinomite was used to destory the wall. Vanessa peaked through the hole. The tunnel looked like it lead to palace. That must of been how he
escaped the palace. Vanessa headed down the passage way and it came out at the palace. She headed back to the apartment. Vanessa walked into the
kitchen. There was a staircase opened in the center of the room. Vanessa followed the steps down. It lead to a ships hanger. This was where Antony
must of kept the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony started to prep Detective for the travel. He used leather straps and straped his arms and legs to the chair. 'Will this hurt', asked Detective
'You won't feel a thing', Antony lied. The fact was the trip could be painful and there were unexpected consquiences. Antony had tested the device
before on himself. He had changed past events before and had experienced visions of multipy worlds. The same consqiences could happen to Decective
when he goes back.
Antony gave Detective an injection. 'Are you ready?', Antony asked. Detective nodded. Antony handed Detective the time split device. Antony had
preprogrammed to take Detective back to a certain moment. 'Just hit the green button when you are ready', Antony told Detective. He pressed down on
the greenbutton. His body frozen in time before he coulf take it off. Antony stood there with his mouth open, he hadn't finished he was just
speaking. The ship frozen in space and the area around the ship froze. Within a few minutes the ship started to move again as did Antony. Detective
stayed frozen, experiencing the past. Antony looked around the ship. To the left and right. 'Had it worked?', he thought to himself. He steered at
Detective. He was still frozen. His body looked like it had life unlike before when Antony had picked Detectives lifeless body off the kitchen
floor. Would his parents relize he was alive? When Antony had grabed him from the lounge floor Detective was dead. The injection he had given the
brain had brought him back to life. Antony thought it was strange that Detective remembered eating eggs but didn't remember the television broadcast.
'Were you lying to me?', Antony asked the frozen body of Detective. Of course there was no responce - only silence. Antony thought about what
Dectective might be doing right now. Whatever he was doing, it was going to change the present. The lightbulb flickered as Antony sat there. Waiting
for Detective to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day20.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
