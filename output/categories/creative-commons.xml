The Witch made a new leg out of
tin. The leg worked well once the man adjusted. Again the axe slipped and
the
mans right leg was chopped off. The Witch made another leg  out of tin.
The echanted axe cut off the mans arms. The witch made the man new arms
from tin. The head was the next to be removed by the the enchanted axe. The
Witch was  able to fix that with a tin head.
The  man thought he  had  beaten  the council. The axe sliped again and
cut the tinman  in  half. The Witch created a body from tin. The Tinman was
missing his heart. His entire  body had been replaced by circuit boards. A
network of servers talking to each other. The result is a humanold  robot
automonus. The man lost all his love for the girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;body shone brightly in the sun. Did not matter now if axe slipped. Could not
cut him. Only one danger - that his joints would rust. Kept an oil can in
his cottage and took care to oil change him whever needed. A day when he
forgot to this. Caught in a rainstorm. Joints rusted rapidy in the wet weather.
Stood in the same spot for a year. Until the traveling group had rescured
him. The Tinman decided to join the traveling group and seek out a new heart.
Perhaps then he will love the girl.
What most worried Pepper was that her breaad was  nearly gone, and another
meal for herself and Carrot would empty the basket. She could  not live
unless fed.
Pepper and her companions had been walking through tick woods. The road was
still  paved with brick,  but these were covered by dried  branches and dead
leaves.  The walking surface  was uneven.
There were  few birds in the area of the forest. The birds loved
open country where there is plenty of sunshine. A deep growl was heard from
a wild animal hidden among the trees. These sounds made Peppers heart beat
fast, for she did not know what they were. Carrot knew, walking close to
Pepper.
"How long will it be," Pepper asked of the Tin Woodman, "before we are out
of Squrrials End?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I cannot tell," Tin andwered, "for I have never been to the city of Kormona.
But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it was a long
journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the city where
he dwells the country is so beautiful. But I am not afraid so long as I have
my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the other, while you bear upon your  forhead
the mark of the The True Witch of  Chaosa's kiss, and that will protect you
from harm".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He is my cat, Carrot," answered Pepper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Is is made of tin, or stuffed?" the bearded man asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Neither. He's a--a--a meat dog," said Pepper.
"Oh! He's a curious animal and seems remarkable small, now that I  look at him.
No one would think of hurting it, except a corward like me," continued the man&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What makes you a coward"? asked Pepper, looking at the giant man  in  wonder,
for he was as big as a small horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's a mystery," replied the man. "I suppose I was born that way. All the
others in the forest naturally expect me to be brave. If I yelled loudly
everythng living would be frightened and move out of the way. Whenever I've
met someone and I've been awfully scared. Just a yell and  the person runs
away. Of course I  let them escape".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But that isn't right. You shouldm't be a coward" said Pepper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I know it", returned the man, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail. "Itis my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper had enough writing for the day. She had reached for word count for the
day. Her project was part of the copyright paper she was taking. It invoved
the task on using material either in public domain or creative commons,
remixing the content and sharing the new material created. Pepper decided to
write a novel for her project. She merged together a range of materal -
beginning with the Pepper&amp;amp;Carrot webcomics by authorname, creative commons
resources, the wizard of oz. By using a range of material content would be
easy to write. By sampling a range of content the work is already done. It's
just about merging it togther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the riverbanj a tree full of fine fruit. This pleased Pepper, who had
eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe
fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper awoke from her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly
astonished to find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing
arpnd and looking at her timily. But the  Scarecrow tod her about everything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:
"ermit me to introduce you her Majesty, the Queen."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper nodded gravely and the Queen made a cursty, after which she beame
quite friendly with the little girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mice were fasten to the truck. All mice had been harnessed, they were able
to pull it eaily. They could sit on it and were drawn swiftly by their
horses to where the man lay asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a great deal of hard work, for the man was heavy they manage to get him
up on the truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper needed a break. She was 39% through The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. It's
an excellent written book. It's been fun for her to mix the worlds of
Wizard of Oz and Pepper&amp;amp;Carrot together. This was only posible because
of public domain and creative commons.  As a learning resource go take a
book or 2 and remix them into a new, unique novel. Look at joining some
online writing group. Even better join a local one then connect with those
online. Regular meetups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you ever need us again," she said, "come out into the field  and call, and we
shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good-bye!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Good-bye!" they all answered,  and aay the Queen rran, while Pepper held
Carrot tightly lest he  should run after her and  frighten her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crow brought Pepper some fruit from a tree near by, which she ate for her
dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have always though myself very big and terrible; yet as such little things
as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as micee have saved my life.
How strange it all is! But, compades, what shall we do now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"WWe must journey on until we find  the road of brick again," said Pepper,
"and then we can  keep on to Kormona."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Warrior being fully refreshe, and feeling quite like himself again, they
started upon the journet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I want him to give me some brains," said Crow eagerlyl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh, company could do that easily enough," declared the man.  "He has more
brains than he needs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And I  want him to give me a heart," said Tin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone had they requests for what they wanted. Pepper character wants to
return home. Man wants courage. Tin wants heart. Crow wants
Pepper just wants to finish highschool. This is just a story of her project.
Mix the subjects around. Has to attend a conference   and  speak. Can be
lightning talk. Slides must be used. Recommend 1 slide  per minute talk.
Q and A is fine, maybe even doing the whole talk in a Q&amp;amp;A setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has been writen in March serves as a prologue. For the month of April the
aim is for 50,000 words. The event is Camp NaNoWriMo. This will be   1,667
words per  day. There is no planning ahead on the novel. The only planning
was  a title. It started as peppercarrot  then  changed to peppercarrotcopyright.
I  had though of peppercarrotdeath.
Then again, it is  a trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper, Carrot, Crow,  Tin,  Man  are the traveling party in the novel that
pepper is writing. Pepper, Carrot and Cumin are the characters traveling
snow. Each version  of Pepper studies something different. Reader is given
the info that Pepper  learns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the outcome in  the end of the  first book? 2nd? third?  Made to thin
it is going to be normal story pace but then novel 'changes'. How does this
change happen? Can it be done without being lame?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protaginst is 14 years old therefore it is a young adult novel. More
resolution takes place than a adult novel. Shift the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orbs. Now only 35 gold. With a built in 3d touch display the new single board
quad  core computers were  selling like hotcakes. Ever child  in Hevena and
their father wanted one of these devices. It was  running a custom build of
the Debian Linux ARM system.
Loading it with a free operating system meant that it was able to be sold
cheaper. The company behind the orb was a non-profit based in the UK. One
of the founders noticed a lack of university enterence students with
computer skills. The Orb was created as an education tool. A way of getting
people intereste in computers and getting them to create stuff rather than
just consume.
The orb was made to be tinkered with. People were encrourged to build new
and exciting creations with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death was interested in the orb. He didn't get time off often but when he did
he enjoyed playing video games or watching movies with his orb. He hadn't
tinkered with the system and built something unique. Death had always wanted
to tinker with systems but the education was poor when he was in school. It
wasn't the teachers fault. Technology was moving so quickly they needed indrustyleaders to teach the teachers, then the teachers teach the children.
"I'm not sure if this is going to work. It is worth a go" said Death.
An orb machine had broken. it had been overclocked and the processer heated
up. This didn't matter, you could just buy a new orb and place the SD card
into the new orb. Sometimes the SD cards failed. It was  easy to keep a
backup of them. Post companies also offered services of backup methods.
Able to withdraw private and  public keys via  ATM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A volunteer from Creative Commons Hevena came to Peppers Orphanage in Squrrials
End to speak to all the teachers in the area. The Witches Instrutue of
Education had bunddled together teachers from various schools that were
interested in licensing and getting Creative Commons policys into schools.
Oh that's what this novel will be called. Creative Commons in Schools. It
will tell of a journey of copyright infringment to sharing, remixing, and
adapting of works. Teachers around Hevena would no longer break copyright
by sharing the resources they are creating. The copyright belongs to the
board of trustess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Witches squeezed into the orphange conference room. It could fit around
800 souls. The place was packed. Several Witches were flying on their
broomsticks - unable to decided where to sit. Several decided to stay
perched upon their brooms. This made it hard for those in a seat to see.
The speaker was introduced and walked out on stage. Their slides appeared.
They spoke clearly and confidently about the subject. They were in fact
terrified but it didn't show. Never had they spoken in front of this many
people. So many well educated and able to sense any fault.
The crowd  went  wild with laughter and aookiuse,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning about Creative Commons build digital citizenship. Founded by fellas.
that wanted to see an altenative to copyright. It's not even tested. Copyright
hasn't been around for long. It was created in a attempt to protect creations
that people make. Has big Stop you may not use this sign, People go crazy over
it. They love it. They thrive on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>creative commons</category><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot10.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot09</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot09.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pepper and Carrot and Copyright&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sometime he had been searching for web comics that could be remixed. The
copyright works of Jem was remixed into new artworks but none of her comics
were taken into a written form. Maybe something to explore?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the site DeviantArt the web comic Pepper&amp;amp;Carrot was discovered. This
was instant inspiration. Upfront he knew he could remix this as permission had
been granted in advance. If the works hadn't been under a Creative Commons
licence then the remix wouldn't of happened. There is no way the artist who's
work is under copyright will be contacted and permission seeked to use the
work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a novel about witches, technology, and copyright. It's a children
novel with fantasy, science fiction, and historic fiction influence.  The
fantasy comes from the witches world of hevena, science fiction for the
copyright licences  and tech, historic fiction for creating a medieval world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempts have been made to keep true to the Pepper and Carrot universe.
Excising characters  and stories developed instead of fresh. This helps
with linking the web comic  with the  novel. Influences have  also  been
taken from Fan Fiction writing of Pepper&amp;amp;Carrot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A co-author would be fun to work work. Maybe  someone that will give a  basic
plot or  senerial and I  can expand  from there. This is why web comic is an
excellent trigger. Able to write about images - colours, objects, characters,
environments - everything that is displayed in the web comic  can be transferred
to text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper had transformed her home. No longer was it empty with modem technology
but now devices were scatted around her home. Her main reason to use the
tech was to improve her productivity of magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spiders had decided of a one orb per orphan. It was a goal to get old orbs
refurnished and given to the orphans around Hevena that had nothing.
The spiders adjusted his glasses with a twitch of  a nose. Out of the corner
of their eye they saw two figures enter the room. In the zone they didn't
want to  be  distracted by intruders. Smashing the keys the bugs in the
software  were removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How people access information has radically changed. Until recently most of
archival items were largely unknown. Rich resource that includes photos,
newspapers,  oral histories and maps. Requests for resources that took up
valuable staff time and "put people off using the images". Someone that leans
towards openness. Material coming in digital form only. Digitise the material
and let the donors keep the original. Building material with this system.
"Our focus  has been on accessibility, rather than reuse. Releasing images of
the collection for download is now a core part of the work flow of copyright
assessment. Providing the  highest-resolution image file means wider scope
for reuse. "Let's iterate!".
Start with what you  do now, at the bottom of the mountain. Don't worry at
what's at the top. It might be solved on the trip, if it doesn't concentrate
better on solving at the top.
Internal efficiency savings. New clearer copyright and open licensing  statements
mean less confusion, less worry about inadvertently doing something illegal,
and less time taken up processing rights requests and queries. Cut through the
copyright bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper wanted to become a IP and copyright witch. She would fight for justice
in the courts and side with witches that shared their creations. For too long
laws had sweep over them that didn't give them permission to share the resources
they were creating. There had been several reports of copyright infringement
at the school. The outcome was the death of several witches - all by burning.
As they are being burnt the Hevena Copyright Law is read aloud to them.
Not only are their last moments on the planet painful, they are also filled
with lawyers preaching. After the final burning screams of the witches fade
the final passage is read. "ALL RIGHTS RESERVED".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper had defensive security in place in case the ip and copyright police
raided her. She had been receiving death threats over her latest potions.
A large company was accusing Pepper of breaking patents. Pepper argued back
that like software spell and potion patents were wrong. She had been working
on getting spell and potion patents banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was copyright that first started the war between the two houses. One Earth
based and the other water. They accessed each other of copyright infringement.
The whole case  went over the top. Billions of tax payers money was spent on
fighting, countless lives on both sides were lost. The documents contained in
the parel being shipped  was trademark and bonds  shares of the world.
Everything that a copyright logo could be attached to was in this file. It
contained the meta data to all of pepper&amp;amp;carrot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The black and white C logo glowed brightly on the opening screen. It always
appeared at this moment, much to Peppers frustration. It started it fade.
At last it was time for Pepper and Carrot to enter the scene. Those with
the logo Pepper and Carrot below their portrait. Both Pepper and Carrot had
large gleaming their  smiles. Both had shining white teeth - with Carrots
being extra sharp. The two held their pose at the scene contained. Next a
range of stages would be setup. There were several choices. Peppers home.

be any of the choices - it depended on the scene. The whole show was improve.
Live actors with rough scripts - or guidelines. Nothing was truly planned
and the  actors were encouraged to develop new story.
The actress that played Pepper was recently replaced. There had been a terrible
accident and the actress had died. Whenever a actor dies they need to be
replaced. Sometimes it can be hard to find a new actor. this time it was
easy. The company advertised the job on various actor message replied - and
got dozens of replies from young ladies  (and a few men) that believed they
would make a perfect Pepper actor. The interviews took time. Those that had
a high and low chance of the job were moved into the next process with all
the middle thrown out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had travelled with her Mother to the audition. They wanted to do it for the
experience, nothing else. It  was  a  nice Mother and daughter activity to do.
Audition for a television show. The company had thought about using lookalikes
for the actors but the  detail wasn't precise enough. They needed exact
clones. The  company had been experimenting with cloning but it  had been
a failure. The funded was keeping the research alive. Scientists were able
to study the process and release the results under a open licensed document.
In the entrance foyer to the school a TV glared with sports playing. The
sports were muted with light background music being played in the background.
It wasn't too loud and allowed people to hear each other and not boring as
silence. There were options. Music pauses when someone speaker. This was
popular amongst many. "GET OUT OF THE WAY", being yelled would be heard as
the elevator jazz would be paused and the booming voice would injected.
There was a global channel that people were  in - off this were various
alternative channels. The system was built on the music genooue project. The
engine and data was open sourced and received a boost of contributes.
At first they thought the project was going to fail but it was boosted to
full health when the transition to open source occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No idea where this is going. Almost April so Camp NanoWriMo begins. Goal is
35,000 rough draft childrens/young adult novel. Idea was to work on Pepper and Carrot
themed novel. Warming up with writing about them in March. Take the works
written in March and have a goal of 50,000 words - 15,000 words from the
month of March. Have activies and plans for helping generate novel.
Read webcomic. Write about whats happening in the panels that you believe
are most important. Free to test as many different writing styles as posible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main character of the story is a 14 year old witch named Pepper. She owns a
cat called Carrot. He is a fluffy orange coloured cat. The novel begins when
Pepper arrives at the witches orphanage in Squirals End. She is dropped off at
the house with a suitcase,  a orb, and her cat - Carrot. As she walks to the
front door she can see the magic moving around  her. This area of Hevena was
hit hard by the nector. It changed stuff. Made everything better. stronger.
more productive. happier. a pig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel followed Pepper and Carrot through training to become
a fully qua;ified witch. One of the subjects that Pepper studies is
copyright.
She does this through reading about creative commons and applying  the
licence to some content she makes.
This is not a historic fiction. This is not a science fiction. This is not
a fantasy novel.
Lets make stuff creatives commons. How to do it? Get the words. Get the image.
Include this on any work under a creative commons licence. Use a licence
generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper  was  the choosen witch of chaorsa. Decides to not fulfill a destiny,
but instead is smart and resourceful. She is an orphan. This novel is a
trilogy.
Write Pepper and Carrot in a range of different genres. Crime, Mystery,
Romance, thriller, horror, science fiction, historic fiction.
coming-of-age story. Adult reader that have trouble buying into a magic system.
Story that explores the character with a little magic in the background.
If story straddles between literary and fantasy, capture this audience.
Why does the magic system work how it does? How did it come about?
These are questions that will be touched on. First book is the first two year
of Pepper at the orphange. Second book is third and fourth. Third and final
book is her sixth year and life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story about a girl named Pepper. She had recently become a orphan
and had arrived at the  orphanage with all the other orphan children. Life
was horrible. Food was rare. The water was dirty. People were dying the
city. Famine had spread. The crops at the farms in Squrrials End were dead. The
animals disease ridden and sick. Infections spread amongst the cities. It
couldn't be controled. It spread till life was scarse. It was foretold that
a witch would rise and become a True Witch of Chaoseha - cure and purge the
evil and sickness. Strike down with holy vengence. Praise the lord. The yell
echoed the Church room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Talk like that could get you killed", Pepper spoke.
The other Witchs mouth quivered. Pepper had shut her up. The troops needed to
be kept in place. Otherwise they would have no rules and wont do what is asked
of them. Churches had been outlawed by the council. They saw them as a threat.
The church that Pepper and Saffron were standing in was one of the last remainding
churches. If the council discovered the church they would burn it down. It
would make headline news if it did. It had been almost ten years since the
last church was burnt down. The footage was always shown with the tunes
the tiger lillies start a fire playing. This footage was played on repeat
on some channels till today. Other mainstream channels play it during the
adbreak. The footage of the church burning is followed by selfie images of
Jesus Christ being killed. A selfie stick was placed above him and people
could pay to get a photo (or five) with the dying man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advancment of the witches spells and potions crypto had become
useless as spells would be able to attack the code. Through reverse
engineering the work could be cracked. This caused panic. Packets could be
encrupt and private keys forged. It was unspeakable of the harm it could do.
That's why the war happened. It was a bunch of witches fighting over zeros
and ones. The security of the Hevena people. From those farmers in Squrriels
End to those rich merchants and bakery owners. Guilt sank in Saffrons
face. Of the floating city of Komarha. The annoucment continued.
"ALL WITCHES REPORT TO YOUR CELL LEADER", the announcment voice boome. The
quality of the speakers were not high. The prison had forbitt the use of
audio packages - giving the excuse that it was a security threat. No one had
ever successfully escaped from the prison. Since the uproar the prison had
been turned into a camp for witches. Somewhere the council were able to lock
them away. Those that attempted to escape where killed, along with anyone
that may of assisted them in their escape. When being torched they were
asked to name and kill those that helped them escape. The one that attempted
to escape was killed in the end- after much pain. Life was not good for the
witches. The portal between the magical world of Hevena and Earth had been
open - both people and animals from each world entered the others world.
On Earth the Witches were treated like the devil and burnt to death. Ther was
no nice policy. Those waiting to be burnt lived in the prison camps. Here they
were forced to work and create goods that was then sold by the concil at high
price with little of  the profits given back to the prisoneer. Some considered
it slavee labour. Groups around the world were in support of the witches and
several humans were caught attempting to enter a witch prison camp. They weere
unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The witch conquered the Hevena and tyrannically ruled over the world after
the fall of the King. Ebchanced weapons that caused those that used them to
cut their own bodies.
wolves, crows, black bees, monkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>creative commons</category><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot09.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 27 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
