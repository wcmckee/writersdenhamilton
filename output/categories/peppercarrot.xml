A group of skeleton warriors charged
at the group of witches. Coriander posed battle ready in the centre. Welding
a buster sword with two hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after the party Pepper woke late inn the morning. The sky was a bright
blue with a few scatted clouds.
At the front door Pepper and Carrot discovered signals of the mountains, the
forest, and the clouds? The two wondered why security had been activated.
Then Pepper remembered. She had forgotten to disable the security systems and
her party guests had been detained. Pepper and Carrot travelled on the broom
to each of the trapped guests. First they found Saffron who was lifted into
the air with a branch from the ancient tree. The tree laughed as Pepper
apologised to Saffron and released her. She was not impressed.
The next witch that Pepper and Carrot discovered was Coriander. Her leg was
chained to a friendly giant mountain. Along the top soil lay with green grass
sprouting out.
Pepper asked them if they had a good night, besides the light rain.
"Everyone is safe, no harm done, right?", Pepper asks for forgiveness.
She tells them she has  prepared tea and invite the witches home.
They are annoyed with Pepper but follow her home anyway - they are all
thirsty after a night of being trapped by the security system.
The way the other witches were looking at Pepper was upsetting for her. Pepper
heard them whispering nasty remarks - especially Saffron.
The witches pets wanted to fix this. Together they decided to make
themselves sick, causing Pepper to lead and cure every ones pets. The plan works,
the animals get sick, Pepper cures them. Everyone is happy with Pepper.
One of the side effects of the cure was fur and feather loss. All the animals
are annoyed with Carrot as he didn't tell them this and if he had told them
they would of not gone along with the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrot had ran off and Pepper couldn't find him. She was beginning to worry
about her cats safety. It wasn't like him to run off. Pepper tracked Carrot
deep into the forest. She had never been this deep before. Calling Carrots
name Pepper found the cat sleeping on the grass under a rocky cliff.
As Pepper wakes Carrot a shining blue circle light appeared behind them.
Pepper looks around surprised of the magic happening. The light explodes,
revealing a tunnel where the rocks use to be. Pepper and Carrot had to
follow the tunnel.
The tunnel lead to a blue pool of water with several blue flying creatures
hovering above. The leader of the group welcomes them to  the magical fairy
cave. Pepper and Carrot realise that they have discovered fairies.
The fairies grant them a single wish promising anything they desire.
'anything... ...I desire', Pepper wonders. The ideas of what she would wish
for appear in her head. A new hat and wand, a unicorn, a dress, a doll, gold,
wings, or love. These were just a selection of ideas that Pepper thought of.
Pepper started to ask for her wish, "I... I'd like to", She stumbled.
"uh, what I'd like is that...", Carrot interrupted Pepper with a tired,
"Meow". Immediately Carrot collapsed to sleep. Tne fairies announced the
wish had  been granted and disappeared. Pepper was annoyed with Carrot. The
cat had wasted the one wish on asking to go back to sleep.
What was the effects of the green potion? Used to summon demons into the
world that starts to fight with the flying creature. Need to use potions on
the demons in order to beat the flying creatures. Need to control the demons
around the city wiping out any invading creatures. Fades between war between
houses (water demon invasion), and new war of flying creature vs peppers
demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thick green liquid sat wasted at Peppers home. All she had was a glass
bottle with Carrots urine in. It was from his latest vet visit.
To stop the oversized beast from destroying the city Pepper threatened to pour
the potion on the animal. In disgust the flying creature agreed to leave the
city. Where did it go? What was the outcome of leaving the city? What if
Peppers trick didn't work, instead it took over the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cauldron boiled as Pepper tipped the final ingredients in. It sizzled.
"and the last touch", Pepper annouched to Carrot. He wasn't paying any
attention. Instead Carrot was sleeping.
Pepper tasted the potion. She looked over and asked Carrot if it was strong
enough. Carrot was still  sleeping. Pepper went ahead and poured the rest
of the package into the cauldron. A yellow and  green light blasted from the
pot. A golden liquid spread up - covering several items in Peppers room,
including her broom.
In a attempt to stop it - Carrot jumped into the cauldron. The cat was covered
in the Golden liquid.
Later that night  they entered into a witch race. Pepper wore her goggles and
had the number '18' tapped to the end of her broom. Carrot  floated above the
broom attached with a rope. He wore goggles similar to Peppers.
Both Carrot and the broom were glowing in the night  sky a golden colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's exactly what I need", Pepper told Carrot. The cat looked up from it's
sleeping spot. "CARROT", the witch yelled. Carrot was fully awake now.
"Get ready, we'll hunt the ingredients together". Pepper dragged Carrot from
its bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"First I need a few pearls of mist from those black clouds...", Pepper told
Carrot. The two were flying though a storm. The cloud were so dark and thick
it was impossible to see. Carrot held the net used to catch the pearls.
Pepper needed to travel to the haunted  jungle for red berries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Egg shells from the Phoenix valley of the volcano's and finally a drop of
milk from a young DragonCow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of the potion contest Pepper was finishing her genius potion at
2.00am in the morning. She knew her potion would beat the other witches -
including Saffron. The witch needed to test the potion on someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"CARROT", called Pepper. Her ginger cat would be a perfect test subject.
Opening the window, Pepper yelled into the night sky, "CARROT".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food was used to lure Carrot back home. The ginger  cat was on the outskirts
of the city. Saffrons cat was perched up on a tree. Carrot  had been singing
to  the cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrot burst through his cat door. Pepper picked the cat up with both arms.
'aww, Carrot', Pepper spoke as she held the cat.
"Sweet kitty cat, you've come all by yourself". A wide smile swept over
Peppers face. "At the very moment when I need my favourite assistant".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper had remembered that she needed Carrot to test the potion.
Carrot sat on a pink pillow chair. In front of the cat the owner, Pepper
revealed, "the potion of Genius". Pepper forces Carrot to take a sip of the
potion through a strew. "Do please take a sip", Pepper insists, holding the
straw in the cats mouth. Carrot swallows and ingests some of the blue
liquid. He gains a burst of energy and knowledge then becomes over whelmed and
just wants to sleep. Visions of other universes and planets blast through
the cats mind. On a chalk board Carrot writes E=Mc2. Pepper is shocked when
the cat begins to write. She has no idea of the cats talents. Pepper attempts
to guess what Carrot is writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"E? Energy? Eternal? Emotion?", Pepper attempted to guess what Carrot was
writing. "What else can this mean? Embed? Empty?", Pepper was growing angry
that she couldn't guess it. When Carrot had finally finished Carrot didn't
understand what the cat had written.
Carrots eyes glowed a blue colour and spirals were in replacement of the cats
normal eyes.
"C'mon Carrot, I'm running out of words and this really doesn't make any
sense", Pepper complained. "This really doesn't make any sense". Pepper
turned blue. Clutching the potion the witch growled, yelling "Nothing ever
works for me".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrot had fallen asleep. Pepper decided to throw the potion out the window
and start again. The potion smashed through the window and onto the grass
outside. The blue liquid oozes out of the cracked bottle. It creates a pool
of glowing blue liquid. The liquid effects a group of ants who develop
advance intelligence levels. The liquid effects other animals and begins a
war between insects.  Those ants take the liquid back to their colony,
infected the majority of the ants in the area. They advance to high level
maths and robotics. Create an army of insect robots that are used in the
war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steel waiter robot used for household work. Able to print the robots then
cast a spell of zombifaction to bring it to life. Config file that allows
choice in how the bot works. App to update the robots from device, or
cronjobs. Knows to do certain things. Eg: Get car to return children home
daily. Car is parked at school daily and used for other uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rea can be loosely thought of as collecting the by-products of a task.
By concentrating on making a potion for a loved one the practitioner can
harness some of the Rea used in creating the potion. Conversely if there is no
attachment, or if the practitioner is careless then the Rea is lost and the
Rea must be obtained via other more costly means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rea is used for all aspects of live on Hereva. Farmers in the village of
Squirrel's End use Rea to grow healthier crops. They use Rea to ward off
denizens of the forest. Witches of Hereva find the use of Rea for mere
"chores" beneath them, and reserve their Rea use for more important matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training is one of the schools of magic allows for more controlled and
focused use of Rea. Without this training Rea becomes
more of a "guided intention" rather than a direct command of Rea. By careful
study,focus, and desire one can learn to harness Rea to
conform to their will. As the Herevans learned how to control Rea they quickly
realized this power could cause havoc if not properly taught, and
formed the schools of magic  to properly teach the various ways of harnessing
Rea.
Some schools become more secretive about their methods for controlling Rea ,
while others remained open to all students (mostly from necessity, but some
because of the charters of their founding members). Most of the people of
Hereva know a little bit of the schools of magic they were exposed to.
For example the farmers of Hereva know a diluted form of Hippiah magic passed on from generation to the next. There is a difference in mimicking the magic of a school and knowing all their secret knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rea use must be replenished. It can be replenished in various ways -
meditation
n, focus and dedication of a project. Beware those who claim to have
invented a way to regenerate Rea with effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group of genius ants become known as Savant-Ant. There were affected by
the potion of Genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flying created that landed on Peppers bed when flying to the potion
contest was a Dragon-drake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hornuk is a Demon of Chaosah and is male. He lives in  Dimension Chaosah
but can be summoned for a short time in Hereva's main reality.
Hornuk is a midsize hairy green demon. Horns stick out the top of his
head and long sharp claws are attached to his fingers. The demons favourite
food is cupcakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eyeuk was the next demon to appear from the portal. He was a similar size to
the previous demon, Hornuk. Instead of green hair Eyeuk was covered in red.
He had an extra two eyes and large muscles. Clutched in his hand was a
trident weapon. Eyeuk leads the demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final demon to walk through the portal was Spiduk. The only female in the
group of demons. She is a similar size to her male counter-parts but
spider shaped with a purple glow to her body. She carried with her a cup of
tea, that she was sipping on. In another arm she carried a teapot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theorem-the-Golem was a male Golem that in the Mountain behind Squirrel's
End. He is part of the security systems created by Pepper. Pigeons live with
him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dragonmoose is a male dragon that lives high in the clouds on the top
of the mountains behind Squirrel's End. He's a large and hairy dragon with
a moose shaped head. A very friendly creature. Female Dragonmooose eggs have
a range of colours - from pastel blue to yellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot07.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot06</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot06.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Three Witches  left Pepper and headed into another  room - closing the
door behind them. 'She seems fine', the youngest Witch spoke. The  other two
stood there and steered at the other for sometime. 'The neighbour was not
making it up though, he had  evidence of the events taking place', another
added. The three discussed for sometime how they would deal with Pepper and
the events that had unfolded. Finally they came to a agreement. The three
exited the room and headed towards Pepper.
Pepper stood up from her chair and looked around at her three Godmothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death stood at the door. Leaning against the  wooden frame. He gazed at
Pepper. She stood there, looking back at him.  Her  godmothers  around her.
Death had  yet  to realised that the  neighbour had spotted him walking in the
witches home with Pepper. His jaw dropped when the three witches questioned
Pepper over the event. Death bolted. He left the building. War had failed and
now they were being punished for it. The four horsemen successfully killed
Pepper parents and grandparents. For years Pepper had manoeuvred them.
They had  tracked Pepper down to an orphanage. After her parents  were killed
she was sent here to learn to become a Witch. She was given  a cat that she
named Carrot.
No longer did they have the two magic houses at war with each other, with the
rest of the houses stuck in the middle. The operation was a success but years
later they discovered left overs. Recently returned to the world and attacking
Pepper. Causing her to learn more about her grandparents and parents.
She was the last left in the bloodline. The rest had been hunted down  and
thrown  into Hades.  It was there they were judged in front of the gods and
thrown to hell or allowed into heaven. There has been attempts to return to
the world of Hevena from heaven. Several tried but failed. Once they reached
heaven, there was no escape.
Those that were cast to hell were able to return to the world of the living
and spread Satan's word. It is a horrible job and the pay is lousy.
Some believe that those in hell are given more freedom than those in heaven.
That is until someone escaped from heaven. A rogue Angle attacked heaven
and disabled the security used to stop people escaping. The angel was able
to leave heaven and returned to the world of the living. It was here that
the angel meet a wizard and feel in love. The two had three children.
Another family Saffrons grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Peppers broom her demons had changed. They were now water and wind
based. She was learning how to control their new powers. The demons would be
similar to what her parents controlled. Peppers great-great-great grandmother
had been an angel from  heaven that had escaped  heaven and returned to the
world of the living. The four horse men were tasked with hunting down  and returning
those that were of the blood tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffron hurried off to class. She hated being late and today was going to  be
one of those  days. The girl had decided she needed to set her alarm spell to
activate earlier. She didn't need as  much sleep as she use to. It  was
important  for her to focus on her studies. Though she lived in an orphanage
a large sum of her parents fortune was invested into the orphanage. No
expense was  spared for the school. It was the very best. The tutors were
highly trained Witches and Wizards who had spent their lives perfecting their
craft. Peppers tutors had spent their live at their home experimenting
never leaving or achieving anything. They just said they were only
interested in creating a true witch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper awoke with the sun shining into her eyes. The witch thought she
had left her bedroom window open. Brisk morning breeze brushed her face.
Opening one eye Pepper could see The Great Tree in the distance. The city of
Komonai. She remembered about the potion contest. Realising that she must have
fallen asleep. A winged duck landed on her bed. Pepper looked at it in wonder
"QUACK", the duck asked Pepper. "You are too kind, but I have a potions
event to attend", pepper replies to the duck. "Another time?", smiles
Pepper. The duck fly's off disappointed. Pepper realised that she was being
carried to the potions event with her broomstick lifting he bed with Pepper
and Carrot inside. Pepper thanked Carrot for organising everything and getting
her to the potions event on time. The cat looked down from its perch on the
broom - giving Pepper a thumbs up. Peppers  witches  hat was too her right.#
Pepper  steered at it for a moment. The crinkle fabric  crinkling in the
wind, with the pointed top waving back and  forward. There was a fresh set
of clothes in her bag. Inside the bag was a potion filled with a yellow liquid.
It was not the thick green liquid she had created. Carrot must of packed the
wrong potion. Pepper was disappointed and annoyed with Carrot. There was no
way that the potion was going to work. She had lost already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper tried to hide her fear when she landed at the event. She stood proud
on her neatly made bed, wearing a fresh set of clothes. Her witches hat sat
on her head. Looking down she waved at the crowd who cheered her on. Her
bed and broom gently landed by the stage. Pepper leaped out with Carrot
springing side to side behind her. Three figures stood on the stage in
front of Pepper. On old grayhaired mustage, short and round man stood with
two young witches - they must of been the same age as Pepper. The dark
skinned witch had a afro, their witches hat
parting it to the side. Around her neck she
wore a necklace with two skulls. Under the
necklace she wore a red jacket and a white shirt
. A pair of goggles wrapped around the neck of her hat. She wore these when riding her
broom.
A fair haired witch stood on the other side.
She had Asian features but her skin was pale
white. Her top was loose hanging with large
open cuffs. Goldern writing patterns on a red
base. Underneath she wore a low cut white
shirt. In her  right hand she clutched a green
liquid filled glass bottle.
There was spose to be four witches completing
today. Pepper was glad she was not the
last to arrive. A purple tip of a hat appeared
in view of those on stage. All four on the
stage looked at the approaching figure.
Under the purple hat was shoulder height
straight blonde hair. Wide blue eyes steered
back. The witch flashed a white smile at the
contestants as she took her place.
Since all four witches had arrived the contest
ready to begin.  The Mayor introduced the
witches.
First was the dark skinned witch Coriander,
travelling from the Technologists Union for
the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The witch that had arrived at the event last was next to be announced.
Saffron. She posed for the crowd. Cheers erupted from the crowd.
Saffron believed because it was a home crowd she would have an
advantage on winning. A large sum on gold was part of the prize, along
with scholarships and internships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contestants were to demo their potion their potions in the order they
were introduced. Pepper was grateful of this. Perhaps she will have a chance
after all.
The potions had to be used on a test subject. Today's potion contest test subject
was a yellow bird. Coriander was the first witch to demo their potion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pale white witch was next.  Her home is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper was the final witch to be introduced. She stood there with her arms
folded looking cross. She was still angry with Carrot and looked at her
cat in dicuist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot06.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot05</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot05.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;one of the oldest tricks in the book too place. Death had slowed the Witch
down but she was still making a grab for her wand. He thought she had lost.
But for the second time that day Death was wrong. The Witch was able to reach
for her wand and yell off several words that Death didn't understand.
This caused him to be become stunned. The slowing spell Death had cast on the
witch was reserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye continued to follow Pepper under the ocean. The young witch had summoned
three of her demons that she commanded to attach the practice dummy.
Her Demons had morphed since Pepper had learnt these new sets of summon
spells. No longer were they land based Demons who liked cupcakes and drinking
tea, they were water and wind warrior elements.
The three Demons themselves were proud of their new powers. They were better
equipped to defend Pepper - like they had defended her parents and
grandparents before. In the end they had failed their masters - both
Peppers grandparents and parents were killed under their protection. The three
Demons swore that the devastation would never happen again and have focused
on protecting Pepper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neighbour peeked out his lounge windows at the Witches house.
A tall dark figure swept across the Witches property. Beside the figure
was a small Witch. She had a concerned expression. The neighbour knew something
was wrong. The older Witches were not home. He had seen the Three leave the
house on their brooms in the early morning.
He had to do something. Contact somebody. Stop this figure.
His best hope was to take his flying car and find the Witches. They would
go gone to the markets in Korama.
Using the old rusted blue car he was able to travel to the City to warn the
Three Witches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Witches had just finished their  shopping and  flying past the branches
of The Great Tree. In the distance  ahead of them a madman  was driving a
blue flying car towards then. The Witches  dashed out the way as the car
came near, slamming on the breaks. The vehicle slowed down, the man inside
yelling and waving, one arm clutching the steering wheel.The Witches look
around in wonder. The driver was clearly trying to communicate with them.
A man opened the door of the halted vechile, it was floating there with three Witches
at a cautions distance observing. He yelled about something happened at their
home and they needed to return. Created a summoning portal that teleported the
three witches to their home. They rushed inside the building to find Pepper.
They found the girl at her desk drawing up plans for her next spell. Nothing
was wrong. Beside her slept Carrot, the ginger coloured Cat.
A large smile appeared on Peppers face as she noticed her three godmothers
in the room. The shortest and oldest on the left. The leader of the group.
A skinny, tall, young spell tutor and an older plump rounded potions master.
The three had been training  the Pepper everything they knew about being a
Witch. Pepper was to become a true witch of chaos.  The three had promised
the girls parents and grandparents that they would train the girl.
The majority of children Peppers age became orphans due to the war between
two of the magic houses. Other houses were caught in the middle of the
convicts. Lands were destroyed and inhabits slaughtered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peppers new demons took on new forms. Instead of the texture of slime on their
bodies they had a water and transparent wind type forms. They were able to
switch back to their previous forms. One Demon was pure water based. Another
was pure wind based. The final was a mixture of the water and wind.
The water based demon was shaped like a mixture of dolphin and octopus.
Shaped like a dolphin for quick and efficient movement in the water. Long
octopus-like arms and legs coming off the body. When the demon was  on land
it used these octopus legs  to walk, it was certainly not faster than
travelling under the water, but it was OK.
The other side of the schools spells - wind. This demon was filled with fast
moving modules that caused the appearance of things to be blurred and mixed
up. Transparent at essence.
The final demon was a hybrid of the wind and water spells. The appearance was
a blurred effect with water being crashed around the figure. Waves hitting
the shoreline. Lightning cracks. Thunder booms.
Pepper had successfully summoned the three demons in their water and
wind forms. Her previous attempts were failures and the demons were twisted,
deformed, and powerless. She was excited for herself that this was a success.
She knew her parents would be proud of her. If they were still alive. She
had joined this house of magic as she wanted to take revenge for her
parents and houses peoples deaths.
Saffron was her largest threat. Pepper had recently discovered she was following
Pepper. The girl won't be able to follow her to the underwater city but she
was able to summon a eye that followed Pepper and  Carrot under the water
and  to the city. Pepper couldn't allow Saffron to discover where the city
was as she would unleash her army onto the city. Pepper instead  cast a spell
of her own that replaced the footage that the eye recorded with fake images,
leading the army into a trap and death.
He had told Pepper that judgement day was coming and she needed to train for it,
War was  near between some of the worlds most powerful Witches and creatures.
The water elements attacked the cities walls coming in  from the  north east
side  off the ocean. The city had attempted to setup boulders to stop  the
water and break  up  the flow. The  wind elements swept in and lifted these
obscures. The path was  clear for the water to crash upon the cities walls.
After the wind  elements had  cleared a path, the focused on attacking the
city walls in an attempt to collapse. The walls were tough and they stood
strong. The water elements changed tactics and the sky started to pour
with rain and hail above the city. Wind elements stopped attacking the city
walls and  started to lift up the ground - causing mud to spread over the city.
The mixture of mud and rain  caused people to move slow and become inaccurate
with their weapons.
The elements still needed to breach the city. Their defences were low. The
Water elements searched the city for an weak spots. They discovered a door
which had started to leak under the pressure of water and rain. The elements
were able to focus the door - causing a series of tidal waves to hit the door.
Wind elements assisted the water in creation of the tidal waves.
The door burst down after the third tidal wave hit it. Water smashed it's way over the guard building and towards the market square. The elements had
gained entry to the city.
The towns people were helpless when the waves came. They were knee deep in mud and unable to move.
The rain had stopped now that water was focused on tidal waves throughout the
city. A bright sun shone down - causing the mud to harden - trapping the
guards on the spot. They were able to fight the elements but were unable to
move and dodge the attacks. The elements were winning.
Under the ocean in the city an army of Witches controlled these elements -
commanding them to attack the city. They were after one thing - the seed of
flight. It is told that these seeds will grow a magical tree that has the
power of growth and flight - and spreads it to others. The Aquaq Witches wanted
the seed for themselves. Amongst the army of Witches was Peppers parents and
grandparents. Six witches. All commanding the attack on the city of Komora.
The city was in a panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot05.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot04</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot04.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pepper sat on her bed and steered out the window. Her hands on knees.
Carrot looked up. She knows Pepper is upset about her birthday.
Carrot jumps up  on the bed and trys to comfite Pepper.
"It's nearly my birthday and I don't have any friends to celebrate
it with..", Pepper cries. Her head lowers and she bursts into tears.
Hands cover her face. Carrot strokes Peppers shoulder, it does no use.
An idea springs into Carrots head. She springs across to the table.
Carrots claw points at a framed photograph.
"Oh, invite the other witches we met at the Poition Contest?", Pepper
congrats Carrot. A smile apeared on Peppers face. Carrot is pleased with herself.
Pepper and Carrot work together and write invitations with Peppers feather pen.
The two remember back to the day of the potion contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As Mayor of Komona I declear the potion content... Open!",
The mans arms stretched out in excitment. In his right hand he grasped a rolled
scroll. The bag of gold behind him sparked in the sunlight. The four Witchs glearing
at the prize and each other. The winner would get a large prize.
"Our town is delighted to welcome no fewer than four witches for this first
edition", the major continued. He turned and faced the four witches,
"Please give a HUGE round of applause". The crowd burst with noise. A mixture of
nonmagical and magical beings were present in the crowd. Every house of magic was
present. This was one of the key events that lead to Hereva to be destoried. Death
had succecced finally. Pepper faced Death several times. She set traps for him and
hunted him down. For once it wasn't Death that did the hunting. Pepper could feel
icey breath on the back of his shoulder. She knew he was present. Twisting her head
she looked back. Nothing. The bottom of The Great Tree was visible. It's bark
obsorbing the healthy rays of the sun. Tinkle of silver made Pepper focus again.
Coriander was introduced first by the speaker, "All the way from the great
Technologist's Union, it's an honor to welcome the ravishing and ingenious
CORIANDER!". Posing with her chicken in her right arm and holding an orange
potion with her left arm.
Pepper had traveled back to that moment several times in an attempt to change
the future. It was no use, each time she changed events it got worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker continues to introduce the witches,
"not to forget our local girl, Komona's very own witch SAFFRON!". Tilting her head to the
right Saffron smiled holding her right hand on her hip and in the left arm holding the
potion, filled with a yellow bubbly liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"... Our third participant come to us from the lands of setting moons, SHICHIMI!",
The foxs tail was wrapped around the back of Shichimis neck and the fox perched on
the witches left arm. In her other hand she grasped a potion that was green and
had no bubble.
".. and finally, our last participant from the forest of Squirels End, Pepper!",
Standing with a sour and disapointed look on her face. Carrot held up Peppers
potions. It was a pale yellow colour. Death approved of the colour but would rather
a pale green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with time travel is it's easy to get lost and create too many
characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Demons of Chaosah Hornük, Eyeük and Spidük had morphed into their
Wharrgarblah alternative they were much the same - except water and
wind based. Hornük's green fur had grown in length. For the past week
they had been summoned daily into Hereva. The Four Horse Man had been
unleased on the world and the Demons had been summoned to stop them.
Famine had caused the crops in Hereva to die - starting with Squirrel's
End. The 2,000 villagers that lived there - the majority of them Farmers
and poor lost everything. War causd a war between
magic houses. Citizens of Hereva became ill because of the rider
Pestilence. Disease spread. Death was present at Komona when the package
was being transfered. "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A package was being transfered from Squirrel's
end to Komona. The contents would stop the war. Both  Magmah and Aquah
wanted to get their hands on it. The interception happened when the
package was traveling through the park in centre Komona. Aquah forces had
breached the city. The majority of the attack came from the skys.
Saffron's grandparents forght for Magmah and Peppers for Aquah.
The cities walls were destoried by the attack. A large Aquah army
moved through the crumbling walls. The Magmah army retreaded.
The magic school of Ah had discovered the seeds. An eldely witch
that lived in Squirrels Edge had created them. When Magmah and
Aquah had discovered the two armies launched attacks on the farmland
in search for the package. It only contained three seeds. When the Ah
transporer was intercepted in Komona one of the seeds was dropping -
causing The Great Tree to grow - lifting the city of Komona into the
sky. The polin of the tree spread to other areas of Hereva. In Squirrels
Edge the creatures are morphed and plants trees grow with magical powers.
The quality of the food improves dramatically. The crops grow easily.
The Great Tree stops the war. The armies lay down their arms go home.
The House of Ah force Magmah and Aquah to change their names to Kielbasah
and Wharrgarblah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only four dudes so hardcore they can wipe out all sentient life on Hereva.
Portal opened to Hereva and they entered and attempted to wipe out a fourth of the
world each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burger King crown sat upon the statues head. His mouth opening revealing a
nice set of white teeth. The brown beard was well groomed and his hair
curled. "Where is your God now"?, the Statue spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War had been around for centuies and despite Henevas best effects, some of them are
still alive. In his right arm he welded a white staff. It was bluetooth connected.
At the top of the staff was a monitor display. Feeds were sent over and procied
by War. Approval or Denial was given. His job was mostly automated now. After he
was defeated by The Great Tree he lived a relaxed life. Staying in the city of
Komona he stayed hidden by hiding in plain daylight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Mama were all going to die"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"WHO ELSE WERE YOU EXPECTING?", Death whispered into the slowed Witches ear.
Her fingers almost touched her wand. Bursting into laughter Death clapped his
hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Let the games begin!", a voice boomed over the statium. "The vote will be by
applaud-o-meter". First up Coriander's demostration. The dark skinned Witch stood
forward. Holding in left right hand was a dead bird. It's feathers pale. The Bird
had meet with Death already. "Ladies and Gentlemen", Coriander greeted the crowd.
"Fear death no more, thanks to my...", she poured the liquid from her potion onto
the dead animal. "Potion of ZOMBIFICATION!", she yelled towards the crowd. The crowd
clapped as the dead animal rose from the dead and marched forward. Death had failed and
felt very disapointed. Among the crowd Death steered at the girl and the
bright smile on her face, so pleased with herself that she was able to cheat him.
"FANTASTIC! Coriander defies death itself with this mi-ra-cu-lous potion!"
Because they were mocking him Death felt more angry.
Coriander bowed and the applause grew louder. Saffron intrupted the moment,
"But please.. save your applause, people of Komana". The crowd was silent.
"beacause here is MY potion", Saffron announced holding her poition obove her
head. "The real potion you've all been waiting for: the one which will amaze
your neighbors...", the young witch had captavated the crowd. "...make them
jealous!", Saffrpn poured her potion onto the zombie bird. "... all this is possible
with the simple application of a single drop of my ...", a drip of the potion
touched the feathers of the bird.
"POTION OF POSHNESS", Saffron screamed. The bird grew in size. It gained a curly
hairdo and dark gray coloured sunglasses. A brown pokerdot handbag apeared
under it's right wing.  The crowd burst into applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: ERROR/3 (&lt;tt class="docutils"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, line 128)&lt;/p&gt;
Unexpected indentation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Fantastic! Incredible! This potion could make all of Komana rich!". Saffron steered
at Coriander with a smerk on her face. Coriander looked back and frowned.
"Your applause can't be wrong. Coriander has already been eliminated", a smile
flashed accross Saffrons face. Deeper into the abyss Coriander fell. She had been
defeated. The voice moved on to the third witch, "That last demostration would now
seem difficult to beat for Shichimi".&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot04.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot03</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot03.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did the war between Magmah and Aquah begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houses accused each other of stealing one others spell
Aquah unleashed an attack on Magmah. The two houses decided that the winner of
the war would decide the name of the other house and release all their spell
secrets. Of course like any war there was no winner and in the end on the break
of both houses collapsing the High Council of Ah decided that both houses lost
and renamed both houses. A peace treaty between the two houses was signed but
rivery was still tense between the houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magical land of Hereva was born from the magical forces known as 'Chaos and
Evolutions'. Hereva formed when the magic elements of the cosmos evolved from the
chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trainer was waiting for Pepper at the magical underwater city.
She had planned the week out of spells that she would be teaching Pepper. The woman
tapped her feet as she waited for Pepper. She had no patience for lateness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coriander's fiftieth birthday was approaching and she had given a long list
of requests to her Father. She wanted to have the best birthday in Hereva and would
be highly disappointed if he didn't attend to all her requests. Her Father was meeting
with King Acren today. He had been pressuring the city of Komona to implement the tax
system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffron steered out her bedroom window to the city of Kormana below. She lived high
above the city in a tall castle. Saffron liked to live up so high, it gave her power
above all those below her. The city itself was already floating Hereva. Her castle
was owned by the King, but one day when he died she would inherit all his worth. She
prayed that he wouldn't die anytime soon though, life was good with him around.
Only the rich and upper-class lived in Komona, the poor and peasants lived below on
Hereva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffron sighed as she brushed her long blonde hair. Looking into the mirror her
large blue eyes stared back. She was perfect. Sitting on the dressing table
was her purple witches hat. She reached for it and place it upon her head. It matched
her suit. It was important she looked good. She wanted to be the best
witch so headed out the door to her classes. She knew the only way she was going to
be the best was attend classes. Saffron headed down the hallway, past the other
children rooms. They would still be sleeping, all orphans like herself but lazy
and unmotivated - unlike herself. Reaching the end of the hallway she headed down the
flight of steps. It wound around and around, past several stories of sleeping quarters.
Finally she reached the bottom where she was greeted by several orphanage working
preparing breakfast. She had no time for breakfast and waved them goodbye as she
unlocked the front door and headed out into the street. Saffron shrived in the brisk
cold morning. She wished she had another layer of clothes. Winter was approaching and
the tempture was changing. Saffron looked to her right. A group merchant were pushing
their cattle and cargo down the road towards the market. To Saffrons left was a bakery,
clothes store, potions shop, and the butcher. She headed towards the bakery. Outside
the bakery the smells were too good. The smell of fresh baking made Saffron regret
skipping out on breakfast. She skipped into the store. No one was behind the counter.
They must have been out the back. Saffron grabbed a cream bun and rushed back outside
before anyone spotted her. She walked down the road, eating the cream bun quite pleased
with herself. This was better than the breakfast her orphanage offered.
Now she needed to get to class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot03.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot02</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot02.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pepper continued with the recipe. Outside the lightning cracked and a rumble
of thunder could be heard. The dry ingredients were ground and added to a
boiling cauldron of wet ingredients - bats blood, lemon zest, vanilla essence,
and water. The brew bubbled as Pepper danced around the cauldron chanting:
'Witches Brew, Blind Bat, Sour Rabid,  Rise Cut, Cauldron Boil and cut this
grass'. Pepper repeated this chant three times before there was a loud band
and was blown back. 'Did I over do the ingredients', she thought - picking
herself up from the ground she approached the cauldron. The previous red mixture
had changed to a pale green colour. 'It worked!', Pepper yelled giving
Carrot a high five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the potion was complete Pepper needed a test subject. The recipe
recommended kidnapping an unsuspecting human but Pepper felt that was not
very nice. Instead she decided to test it on Carrot. Her cat could cut the
lawns if the potion worked. Pepper poured the thick green mixture into
Carrots water bowl. Carrot proceeded to lap the potion from it's bowl.
Peppere observed Carrot as the potions effects started to kick in. The cats
teeth grew and changed. They turned from short white like to a large metal like
and started to vibrate. The potion was working. Outside the lightning and thunder
had stopped and the weather had cleared up. The grass was dry and sun shining.
Pepper brought Carrot outside and watched as the cat began to cut the lawns.
It was working successfully. Pepper needed to cast a spell on Carrot in order
to stop from vomiting up the grass being ingested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumin, Cayenne and Thyme could see their home in the distance as they flew
their brooms. The three were returning from a day trip to Qualicity.
"What is Pepper up to?", Cayenne asked as they approach the house. Cumin
squinted the Pepper and Carrot, the two up to something in the front of the
house.
"I'm not sure", Cumin replied, "but whatever it is I will find out". The
three witches landed at the house. Cayenne and Thyme went inside the house
carrying the shopping that they had got from Qualicity.
"You're home!', Pepper yelled excited to see Cumin standing over her.
"I guess you are wondering what we are up to?", Pepper added.
Cumin nodded, with a strange expression on her face. Pepper explained how she
created the potion and used it on Carrot and that Carrot was successfully
cutting the grass. Cumin was confused to why the grass needed cut. She had
lived in this house for years and had never cut it in the past. Pepper
explained about meeting the neighbour and wanting to do something to be more
normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kielbasash vs Wharrgarblah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magmah vs Aquah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two schools are on the verge of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house of Kielbasah is focused on cooking, baking, grilling, boiling, frying,
steaming and toasting. It is the house of alchemy and rare metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wharrgarblah is the house of water, wind, clouds and the abyss. Those that are
members live deep under the ocean and rarely interact with those on land. They
believe they are super compared to those on the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper swollen the underwater breathing potion and dived into the ocean. Carrot
followed closely behind. She had been receiving guest training from the house
of Wharrgarblah. The house was cauctionst at first with the training but soon
after discovering Peppers talents of water spells - they welcomed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffron floated on her broom with her cat Komona and watched Pepper dive into
the water. She had been following her for several weeks - with the suspension
that Pepper had became involved with the house Wharrgarblah or Aquah as Saffron
believed the house should be refereed as. Saffron despised the house. Because of
them she was an orphan. He parents were killed in the war between the two
houses. Saffron would do anything in her power to bring down the house and she
felt betrayed by Pepper for being involved with the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Pepper swam she looked behind her and saw Carrot following close behind.
She had cast a spell on him that allowed him to enter the water without
getting wet - an air bubble. This allowed him to breath under water also.
This was just one of the spells Pepper had learnt from her new trainer at
the school of Wharrgarblah. She knew people would be suspicious of her
training with this school. She had learnt that her ancestors were part of the
house and that is why she was drawn into the house. Pepper wasn't worried. She
believed the houses should be kind and accepting to each other - sharing and
open.
Today Pepper was going to learn how to summon miniature bigfish. She had first
encountered BigFish when she was holidaying on an nearby island. Cumin had taught
her how to summon demons so she was able to pickup the spells for summoning
water spirits easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffron had attempted to follow Pepper further. She hoovered above the water.
She was too frightened to enter the water herself, there could be traps or she
might end up drowning. Instead she had cast a spell that allowed to her send
an eye into the ocean to follow Pepper. She was able to stay above the water,
but view what the eye was seeing. They eye was following closely behind Pepper
and Carrot. Saffron hoped that the eye wouldn't be noticed - for her sake and
Peppers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peppers broom had transformed and developed organic fins and propellers to
allow her to travel quickly under the water. She was able to zip along quickly,
with Carrot perched on the front of the broom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot02.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot01</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot01.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;PepperCarrot. A Novel by William Mckee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sat at her workbench. Twirling the feather pen in her
hand. A Cat slept peacefully beside her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mailman approached the mailbox with caution. Warning:
Witch Property, the box read. He had been watching the
house since these new witches had moved in. Several nights
ago as he was chopping onions he noticed from his window
green smoke drifting out  from the property. He had concerns
for what mischief they were up to.
What was worse is it wasn't just a single witch that had
moved in - it was a group of them. Three adult witches and a
child. He had seen the lot of them leave the house on their
broomsticks. He had thought about approaching the house and
having a peak through the window but he was worried that there
might be traps - or that the witches return and cast a spell
on him.
The girl had been friendly. He had seen her walking down the
road with her ginger cat. He had been mowing his lawns (something
they needed to do) when she walked past his house giving
him a wave and yelling "Hello Neighbour, I'm Pepper".
Pepper had a basket containing mushrooms. She offered some
mushrooms to the man but he refused. She tried to talk to him
further but he rushed back inside like he was afraid of her.
The man stomped up his front door steps, opened the door and headed
inside.
The door slammed behind him.
Peaking out the window he watches as Pepper is steering at the
house. He closes the curt-ins and continues to peak out.
Pepper calls out to her cat which is distracted playing
with a moth, "Come on Carrot, Let's finish our walk".
The two continue to walk down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house might need some maintenance Pepper thought. She
the mailbox and looked out to her home in the distance.
The garden had grown wild. An ancient oak tree wrapped its
way through the house. Pepper had asked her godmothers
about clearing it. They were shocked and refused explaining
that the oak tree was in fact alive and they wouldn't dare
chop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper had been given permission to mow the lawns. Maybe
if she maintained the house the neighbour wouldn't be
frightened of her anymore. She wasn't surprised when she
was told that they didn't own a lawnmower. 'Put your
training to use and use magic', Pepper was told. She spent
the morning looking through books for a spell that would
allow her to cut the grass. She found the perfect recipe.
The ingredients read: rose petals, cardamom, ginger, coriander,
hibiscus, red geranium, and powdered dragons tooth. All were
common herbs - except for the dragons tooth which was rare. Pepper
stepped out the back door and
headed towards the herb garden where the herbs grew. Reaching into
her pocket she pulled out a pair of secetares which she used to
cut the herbs. She hummed to herself as she works. The sky was turning
gray, a storm was coming. The Gods had predicted she was going to
make this spell. The first rain-dropped landed as Pepper finished
picking the herbs and took a step inside.
Pepper had picked the majority of ingredients she needed from the
garden. All she needed was the powdered dragons tooth. It was
in a glass container high in the shelf. Pepper climbed the ladder and
retrieved the glass container that contained the dragons tooth. She had
gone to a great deal to retrieve this - travelling around the world in
search of dragons and attempted to remove their teeth. In the end she
ended setting up a dragon dentist business and was overloaded with
toothache dragons that needed a tooth or two removed. Sadly she then
found out that the powdered dragons tooth didn't come from dragons but from
a plant. The Binomial name for Dragons Tooth was Lotus maritimus. It is part
of the genus Lotus. Pepper had to travel to South England for the plant. She
found it on a field in which cows were grazing. The plant had grown to a
height of 30cm.
The flowers were a pale yellow colour. The leaves in three's, 'clover'-like
but longer and terminating more suddenly at the far end.
Pepper learnt to make sure she knew what she was looking for before setting
out on future trips to retrieve ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper had planted the dragons teeth that she had removed from the dragons
in order to build an skeleton army. She would order this army to help out with
her duty's around the house. Pepper watered the patch of garden where she had
planted the teeth twice a day but no skeleton had risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot01.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
