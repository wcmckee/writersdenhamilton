It's the first time I
have given it a go in this month - previously I have only written a novel in
November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper fed Carrot his cat biscuits. He as very hungry that morning. He
hadn't been fed since the previous morning. Pepper had put Carrot on a diet
as she was told that he was getting fat. Carrot was not impressed by this as
he thinks he is a skinny cat. He does not like it when people think he is
fat. Carrot is a long pussy cat. Stretching out over the carpet. His front
two legs are way out in front of his head. The back legs are stretched back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn a few scratches on the pi tft is annoying. Makes it not look so cool.
What can you do about it though? Buy a new monitor? Not worth it yet. I would
rather just use it scratched for now. Might buy a new one in the future with
How did it get the scratches in the screen anyway? Monitor banging against
the wacom pad and keyboard. From falling over onto stuff. General wear and
tear. Need to work on this script for keeping track of word count and files.
Would like more backup things as part of it. Read online that it was not
possible to auto save in nano. Are there alternatives to nano that is simple and
allow auto save?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright I have switched text editors. No longer am I using nano but instead I am using gedit. It has an auto-save built in and word wrapping. The text is a little smaller than the terminal but it works. This is fine. I can tab every 15 minutes of writing and check what my word count is up to. Maybe display word count inside geddit. Anyway got to get going with the word count today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper was excited to win the potions contest. The money she won from it would go towards her training as a witch. She was told by her Godmothers that she was to be the next True Witch of Chaosah. She was the last of her bloodline for this left. It was important for her Godmothers that Pepper take the training seriously and not joke around. There is nothing more than Pepper likes more than joking around and having a good time. She does still take her studies seriously though. Carrot slept beside Pepper as she held the feather pen and drew. Cumin was prancing around the room, looking busy. She had told Pepper that they would continue potions training today, that the holidays were over. Pepper had a great holiday. She had a sleepover at one
of the witches she met at the potions contest and they had played board games late into the night. The witch lived in a giant old castle. It was flash compared to Peppers home. But Pepper liked her place and would not want to live anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumin realised that there was no Dragons Teeth left and asked Cayenne and Thyme if they would go and get some. They declines as it was late in the day. The two witches were happy
around the fireplace. Thyme painted her toenails and had no intention of leaving anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't take long to get a decent amount written. This editor is fine. It's very minimal but has a few more settings than nano that is needed - especially auto save. I have word wrap turned on also so when I reach the end of the screen it moves down to the next line. This is helpful as it means I do not have to hit enter so much. The only thing I might improve is the colour theme. I would like a blue background and dark red text. Similar to my painting. Though with painting a blue background hasn't been used for sometime - it's been plain white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Komora City. Market day. The streets of Komona were busy with sellers and buyers. Amongst them were a figure that wore a light coloured witches hat with a dark band going around the hat. Attached to her back was a broom. Her dark hair poked out the back of the hat. She wore a dark purple coat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Good morning Sir, I would like eight pumpkinstars, please", Pepper asked the shop keeper. The animal had a bald head with very circular ears and a red earring. His nose and mouth was shaped like a muzzle of a dogs. He must have been a mixture of animal and human as his hands were human-like.
"Here you are, that's 60Ko", the shopkeeper handed the pumpkinstars to Pepper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"...Oh dear", Pepper spoke. She emptied the coins from her purse. There was certainly less than 60Ko.
"Uhh sorry, I'll have to take only four..." Pepper apologised to the shop keeper. He looked her angrily and removed two of the Pumpkinstar from the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as they completed their exchange a voice could be heard beside Pepper, "Greeting, good Sir. Please prepare two dozen of everything for me. .Premium quality, as usual. It was a blonde witch. She wore a purple hat and matching outfit. In her hand she held a stack of coins - enough to buyout the shop.
"It's always a pleasure to serve you, Miss Saffron" the shopkeeper greeted her. His mood had switched an an angry mood with the sale with Pepper to a happy mood as he knew Saffron was always a big spender.
Saffron noticed Pepper. "Hey look, it's Pepper" she remarked. Pepper didn't say anything just looked at Saffron annoyed. "Oh. let me guess business is booming in the countryside?", Saffron asked sarcastically.
"I guess your preparing the ingredients for tomorrow's potion challenge", Saffron asked. Pepper finally
spoke. "A potions challenge? Tomorrow?. Pepper left she had enough of Saffron and her bad attitude.
Pepper had found the letter about the potions challenge. It read: Komona Potion Challenge 50,000ko grand prize FOR THE BEST POTION On Azarday, 3 Pinkmoon Grand Plaza of Komona.
Pepper was excited. "Lucky me, I still have a full day to prepare! Let's win this challenge", she yelled in confidence from her broomstick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she arrived home Carrot was there to greet her. He waved, happy that Pepper was home. Pepper studied through a stack of books for ideas for the potion. "Oh! I know", she clicked her finger and a smile rose on her face. "That's exactly what I need!", Carrot opened one of his eyes. He had been trying to sleep when Pepper was reading but now she had woken him with her chatter. Carrot knew what was coming next. "CARROT!", Peppers voice boomed. "Get ready, we'll hunt the ingredients together". Carrot knew he wouldn't be able to sleep anymore. He had to wake and go with Pepper. It would be fine once they started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once loaded on Peppers broomstick the two were ready to leave. Carrot held a large net. the two had rope tired around their waste. The sky was dark but lightning lit up the sky. Heavy black clouds filled the night sky. "First, I need a few pearls of mist from those black clouds", Pepper told Carrot. He knew know what the net was for. It was going to be Carrots job to capture the pearls from the clouds. Tough work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next the two had to go he the haunted jungle for red berries. This was not fun for Carrot who got tangled in a spiders web and was attacked by spiders. The next area to visit was for egg shells from the Phoenix valley of the volcanoes. The heat here was too much for Carrot and he sweated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next ingredient was a drop of milk from a young DragonCow. This giant flying beast had wings and a body like a dragon but a light colour and dark spots and facial features of that of a cow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back home the evening was growing late. The sky was a purple and pink colour and the clouds a bright orange. The sun was setting. It gave Peppers home a gloomy purple look. Inside the home Pepper was busy prepping the potion that she had just gathered the ingredients for. Pepper sat down and tested the potion she made. "mmm. Best. Coffee. Ever", she spoke. Taking another sip of the hot drink she had made. Carrot couldn't take it anymore. All afternoon they had been out to collect ingredients for Peppers potion and it as all for just a coffee. Carrot fell over tired and slept. Pepper was happy with her coffee. "It's everything I'll need to work all night long and make the best potion for tomorrow's challenge".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper spent the night putting together the potion. Finally she came up with the Genius Potion. A potion that makes anyone super smart that consumes it. Pepper got Carrot to test it. It didn't work so Pepper threw it out the window. A group of any came into contact with the potion, causing them to learn advance maths. In the end Pepper ended up falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She awoke in the morning in her bed being flown (by her broom)
to the city of komona. Carrot had prepared fresh clothes and her witches hat. Pepper fell asleep before making another potion. Carrot had prepared a potion for Pepper. It was Carrots urine from a recent vet visit. Pepper was annoyed. she knew she would not win with the potion. What would she do? There were three other
witches entering the competition. Including Saffron who she had met at the Komona markets. The other two witches seemed friendlier. The fair skinned girl was quiet and shy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wow this is almost the word count for today done. 1667 is the word count daily goal for November. But it is cooler to just say 1666. Number of the
devil/Satan. Devout holy novel. litrate. Pepper and Saffron fight over love of the Prince. Both want to marry him. Basically hit my word count for today. Would like to get more done today. It's almost 1100. Beautiful blue sky with white clouds. Slight breeze. Might wear jacket. Take pi and walk. Draw. Sit and do drawing studies of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Writers Den Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An opportunity for writers to develop skills, confidence, and network. Sharing and supporting of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortnightly at the Hamilton Central Library, Kathleen Glenn room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:30pm to 7:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper sat outside her favourite cafe, eating a camera slice and drinking a hot chocolate. Her witch's hat was perched on the back of a chair. Peppers dark hair blew in the wind. A small child walked past. Eyes were fixed on Pepper. The gentle nature of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whats the next web comic that am i going to write about. I see there were several new posts added to the fan art section of the pepper and carrot site. There was one drawing by a New Zealander which was neat. zomg this is not going to work testing one two. Going to check what the word count will be running at today. Today will be the third cafe that I have been to in 3days. All different. At each one I ordered a hot chocolate and a cameral slice. They were all delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death thought it was ironic that he was sitting at Heavens Bakery. It was true that Death didn't choose sides. He served both the  heavens and hells. He felt more attached to Hell. Following Death where ever he went was Hades. The souls that Death removed from the Earths were tossed into Hades then processed to either heaven or hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blue sky was still visable but much of it had  been covered with clouds. Dark gray clouds were forming in the centre. Walking here there was several drops of water. But nothing to worry about much. Wondering to stay here for awhile more then walk home or walk into the city. If I walk into the city I'm worried it's going to rain but if I stay here don't get out as much. There is always tomorrow. That will be the final day to get out. Been busy in the past few days by getting out. Important as don't come here often. This place is nice and it's just good to get away to somewhere you usually don't come. Once there was a secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper can type very fast on her keyboard and doesn't even need to look at any of the keys. How many keys per minutes are you typing. I think they mean characters per minutes. How quick to reach 50,000 words do I need to type? Average out five thousand words every two days. It would take ten days to reach 50,000 words if 5,000 words were typed every.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council of Ah made several magic houses sign a peace treaty. Both Aquah and Magmah after much debate signed the treaty. This brought peace to the world of Hevena. The majority of magic houses were neutral but it had been hard for several of houses. Great shortages of food and health supplies had lead some of the houses to lend aid. Peacekeepers were also sent into hot areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was the first day of Peppers witch school training. For the next 6 years she would live in his home and learn under the direction of Chaosah witches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my birthday and I invited the witches that I competed against at the Potions Contest. Sadly none of them showed up and I was forced to summon demons into Hevena which had the party with me. There were three demons that I summoned. Two which looked similar, one green and hairy. The other was purple and had bigger muscles. Those two demons were both male. The final and third demon was a female spider-like demon. They were friendly demons and enjoyed the party. It was very lowkey. They had cake and tea. The spider demon was a fan of drinking tea - she drank over 20 cups during the evening. She was a friendly spider demon and Pepper had a great time chatting to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Hevena is teaming together to bring you a service and API to help with writing your novels this month. Everyone here will be writing 50,000 words. If you fail you will die. It will be painful. There is no reason why you can can't write. It's just words on a page. The words can be basic and full of mistakes. The important thing is to sit down everyday and write some words. Set a minimal target of words per day. Writing software and apis to help with wordcount. Keeps tracks of the hours and clients. Auto billing. For version control it uses Git. Does commit every 100 or so words. Spell check before commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find most common words in file. Then finds gifs based off the words. Nginx is able to serve billions of requests
per second. Serving only static files. html, css, markdown, rst, txt, png file types. Sites are powered by Nikola a static site generator. Content is licensed under a Creative Commons Attubutation 4.0 International licence unless specified otherwise. Copyright and the evils. Journal subscriptions - access to knowledge - becomes "fiscally unsustainable" to the richest university on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper is an art student. She found some artwork online that she wants to download, print out, and use in her art project. She isn't sure who created the artwork or what that artist might think of her using their work. Does she take a copy? Or look for something else? It can be hard to know. Artists and creators have a problem. Copyright law is getting in the way of realising the potential of the internet in creating and promoting their work.
"Why is this" spoke Pepper. "What digital copyright culture should we work towards to best support the arts?".
The Witch took a drink of water before continuing, "Copyright is a form of intellectual property that is granted by law automatically upon creation of a work. It prevents people other than the creator from kaing copies of (inc luding adapting, sharing or performing) that work without the creator's express permission. It is unregistered - unlike patents or trademarks, you don't have to apply for it. Don't need to use the copyright symbol. Copyright lasts for life of the creator plus fifty years, copyright then expires and the work enters the public domains". Pepper spoke clearly. Switching through the slides as she talked. Once she started talking she was no l77longer nervous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I choose because I like that Attribution-ShareAlike licence gives others the freedom to be able to use my work in any way they wish to, but only if they then allow others to use that work in the same way. By including the ShareAlike restriction in the licence, if someone wishes to use my work commercially then they must open up their own work. This is a positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper lay on her couch with her orb computer sitting on a table in front of her. Using a Bluetooth keyboard she typed the novel. Carrot lay on her legs. He wanted loves from Pepper but she shooed him away, wanting to focus on her novel. She has never edited any of the novels she had written in the past. The first time she entering the writing contest was November 2014. Pepper wrote a science fiction story. It was never long enough to be called a novel, but it was a start. The story followed several characters and places they work and the advancement on automatics matters such as food creation and delivery. In 2015 Pepper was a winner of the contest. She managed to write just over 50,000 words during that month. The room was boiling and was hard for Pepper to focus on her writing. She had made her goal for the dat but had written enough and she had. It had been a record few days for her. It is about learning when you have done enough and giving it a rest for the day. It is too hot though trying to think about getting up and going outside. Need to check how much of the battery is left. It is likely not huge. Of course there is a script to run every 60 seconds that prints the information about the file. The script checks to see the most recent edited file in the writersdenhamilton posts folder. This is where Pepper writes her novels. They are saved in here and shared. Pepper allows people to share, remix and adapt her novels. They are licensed under the very free CC BY. Isn't this wonderful for everyone! When writing the novel Pepper was able to get inspiration from a range of sources - public domain and creative common licensed works. This script could be used by anyone who write files. If care about looking at most recent file changed, the word count, and the most recent word. Had confided getting top 5 words and looking for gifs on them. ignore boring 1 or 2 letter words. Filter the top words. Novel generation. How much of that writing can be taken changed and remixed, and then added back to the novel. When does it get repetitive? Does it make for a decent book? Does it even make it faster. Need to save and check words count. It must be getting high now! Very good. The word count is even more today than yesterday. Need to build some software in April to do with writing. Make graphs out of word count data and content data. In all the novels/short stories what is the most common words that are longer than 2?  That is the question and we need an answer. I am very happy with the setup. Need something to protect the pi and the screen. concerned that its getting damaged when I transport. Would like easy way to put it in bag. Wrap it in protective plastic? I'm not sure but whatever you do, fix it before the screen cracks more. It's a expensive screen and you need to take care of it. Getting tired and should stop this and go and read. Need to perform the git stuff before I get off it. Can keep the pi running all night since it is plugged into the wall. Usually only run it  from the battery pack and have to keep them rotating over. Pi3 is sitting at another place. Looking forward to getting it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>letter</category><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/campnanowrimo-day02.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2016 02:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>campnanowrimo16-day01</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/campnanowrimo-day01.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Saffron,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the letter. It's been too long so splendid to hear from you.
You certainly have been keeping yourself
busy these past few months. Will you show me
some of this new magic? The stuff that is created from the orbs.
Carrot is good, but always very hungry. I think he is missing your cat. Those
two would play together like best buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What more to tell you. Cumin has been teaching me potions. Last week she got
me to get 'Dragons  Teeth'. I thought she meant REAL dragon teeth but she
meant the plant. Have you used the plant in any potions? Anyway I have quite
a few dragons teeth here that I don't know what do with. Do you have any idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of my training I had to scare a human. Everything was going fine till
I entered the room they were sleeping in. omg, you would not believe it.
The most cutest, handsome prince. Our lips were about to touch when BANG he
turned into Thyme. Dammmmnnnnn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went on holiday to a island. It was very chill. just lay on the beach with
Carrot and siped juice. Man there was this giant fish that swollowed the two
of us up. We were stuck in this fishes stomach. Carrot came up with a good
idea and scratched the fishes insides with his long, sharp claws. This caused
the fish to vomit us up. Not the most fun day lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other night me and Carrot followed Thyme going to that cave again. She
was  using that glowing orb. After she left me and Carrot turned it on. I
won't tell you what displayed but it was embrassing lol. I figured it out and
switched it to a endless runner unicorn game. You remember the one you showed
me. The game crashed or something. It must of trigged an alarm or something
because the next minute a giant spider was there to help getting the orb
fixed. He showed us where their server room is. Super cool, next time you
are here I will take you and show you the setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How have your classes been going? Cayenne is teaching me spells. I don't
think shes doing a very good job at it. Maybe if&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway looking forward to your reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;love,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper (and Carrot x)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Pepper,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the return letter. I have been busy with my witch training so
slow to reply. I will teach you some of the magic I have been learning.  It's
mostly stuff to do with earth elements. Quite  different to the demon summoning
that you are mostly into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've heard it's posible to bury dragons teeth and sketeton warriors would
rise from the grave. Sounds like something that the people over at Zombiah
would be interested in. Have you talked to them about uses for the dragons
teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's funny about the cave. What was it that Thyme was looking at? I once
caught one of the workers at the orphanage looking at something they shouldn't
of. blah blah blah goes the letter. Those spiders sound cool. I'm looking
forward to meeting them. Were they affected by the genius potion like the
ant were? They sound smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to hear that Carrot is going well. It's important that he's having
fun. Make sure to feed him only once a day! Any more and he will get fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spiders wrote a script that performed analize of the most recent file
the author is working on. It looks for files that are changed with the
file type rst. Of course this could be set to anything. It also gets the
most recent word at the end of the file.
Auto retrieved what the user has typed. Keylog the file basically. User
doesn't need to save - it saves keystrokes every one minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikola builds the file if changes have been made. If no changes have been
made do not build. Creates new rst file for the day. When the clock hits
midnight create new file. Close old file, open new file. Spell check file.
commit. push. Tweet the last 100 characters, or tweets the keylogger  story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes Saffron evil? She is a manapiftic person that uses others for her
own gain. Thinks little of others. Cruel nature. Like Pepper Saffron is also
an orphan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did Pepper and Saffron become orphans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only witch in the group that has parents is Zombiah. She is spoied by her
father the king. City currently ruled by him but will be pasted to the girl.
After awile they thought nothing of it. People were fighting and killing to
become king. There once was a witch that lived in a shoe. There was an old
lady that lived in a shoe. That's how its going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a new assignment I thought you might to give it a go also. As part of
digital citizenship paper that I have. It's really fun. Basically you about
copyright and the law. They teach you this stuff called Creative Commmons.
I like to think about it as a hack on copyright. What Creative Commons offers
is licences that copyright owners can apply to their work that gives permission
in advance for use of the material. All rights reserved. Some rights
reserved. No rights reserved. Public domain work falls under the no rights
reserved. If something is in the public domain then it's free game to do what
you want with the material.
It's good and well to learn about creative commons but really you need to
apply it. Find a work that is licenced under creative commons or public
domain and share, remix, adapt into something new. Be brave and licence
the something new under a free licence. Once in a while there tests a person.
That this script is working correctly. Everything they do is monitored.
Every keystroke on their devices. Spoken words are analized and compared to
criminal databases. The sirens don't shut up they just keep blasting and blasting.
It's a civil emergeny and the sirens have been blasting for hours. There was
an attack on the city by Aquah. They unleashed their most heavy forces. The
cities walls did not hold. Magmah archers attacked from a distance. Swordmen
attacked enemy forces breaking through, or climbing up the wall. Enemy had
ladders that they used to climb the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you ever wonder what it was like to fight in the war? All those souls
that were lost. They never really discovered what started it. But it was
something between Aquah and Magmah houses. Do you have any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you think of my digital citizenship project? For it I have decided
to write a novel. It's based off the web comic Pepper and Carrot. Merge in
public domain and other creative commons stuff. Write stories out of Jems
comics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I entered this potion contest there were 3 other witches that entered the
contest. The first made a dead bird come alive. She was from the Zombiah
school so typical spell. The next was a girl called Saffron. She made the
undead bird posh. It had a fancy hairdo and handbag. Ah was too frightened
to use her potion but Saffron snatched it from the girl and tossed it on
the undead posh bird. This potion caused the bird to become huge. It was out
of control. Lucky I saw able to scare the bird off with my potion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I have gotten the last of todays word count done I can go and have fun.
I will reward myself. The sun sat to the east. The sound of yelling and screaming
was fading. It had been a day of killing. Tomorrow will be a day of mourning.
Too many souls were killed today on the battlefield. They will be missed by
their wives, mothers, fathers, siblings and children. A roar of thunder could
be heard through the plains. The dark night sky flashed with lightning.
Rain hailed upon the heads of the men. The woman far away in their homeland.
This was the year 1805 and follows the Russians as they faught in wars.
Red coats vs blue coats.  Red is Russia. Blue is France. Prince is captured
by enemy and exchanged for a deal. The deal that the exchance happened is
in lock up and only a few select have seen the deal. It was said to be a peace
treaty between the two houses but the details were never revealed. The council
were accused of withholding important information by not revealing the deatils
of the deal. Spys have been sent to break in to the information and release
the information. The info can't be harmful now as it is outdated and any
information on it. It is said someone within the agency leaked the details
then escaped the company. They didn't hide the fact that they released the
details, but they didn't want to be the face of it. There was public outcry
over the release of the details. From both sides. Those who supported the
witch in releasing the detail - it's for the public good. Transparency of
public agencies. against - harmful to troops. Allowed to spy and watch
everything people do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She siped her bottle of Isaac's Cider Original, typing the beginning of her
novel. It was a young adults novel and the word count goal was 50,000.
Challange to do stuff hasn't done alot in past with novel - first person.
Follow the story though the eyes of a fourteen year old witch in training
called Pepper and her ginger cat - Carrot. Sitting there Carrot purred. He
was a happy pussy cat. For the first day wrote letter from Pepper to Saffron
and a return letter from Saffron. It was really just a warmup and I'm not
sure what to make of anything. I guess just don't worry and look for new
content to include. Get better of not saving and checking wordcount so much
just spending more time only writing. It's getting dark and cold out there.
Soon it will be time to go inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pepper went and attempted to get Dragons Teeth from a range of dragons -
fire, air, swamp. This was a fail and instead opened up a service of removing
dragons teeth for free. This lead to her having a large stock of dragons teeth
due to not needed dragons teeth to begin with. Pepper had gotten it mixed up.
It was the plant dragons tooth that Cumin needed not real dragons teeth.
Pepper had written to several of her friends and asked them what to do with
all these dragons teeth. It was fill of lots of chit-chat but the dragons
teeth questions were most important. Pepper had recieved word that one of the
best things to do war burry them in her garden and skeleton warriors would
rise. She thought this was a great idea by Saffron so did just that. She
found the dragons teeth that were most healthy looking and buried it in her
garden amongst all her vegetables and herbs. Pepper belived you should only
grow what has a use. Food was good to grow as she could make delicious
breakfast, lunch, and dinners out of the food produced. Currently the garden
caters for %100 of the kitchens needs. Pepper needs not visit the market.
She is slective on foods she grows and seeks expert witch advice on the
matter. If you don't do something right. Do it again. The black bird flew
in the sky. The bright blue background behind it. The bird moved in and out of
the Gray clouds. It knew there was going to be a storm still and it needed to
get home to it's family. It was too late and the family of the bird perished
in the storm. The bird was sad and didn't know what to do. One day it was
flying past the majors office in Komana when it dropped to the ground, dead.
It had suffered a heart attack. The major found the dead bird and decided
to use it in the contest the very next day. The bird is still alive -
the giant undead-posh bird. Very much alive. Pepper chased it away from Kormano
but it was quite happy to leave and found a new home. It was able to settle
down with a family. It lived a very jolly life. The tree branches bent in the
wind. Maybe Pepper needs to go and sleep soon I think she has done enough word
for tonight. This is a good start for tomorrow. What will happy tomorrow? This
is very much of a pantster project. Sure its being based off the pepper and
carrot web comic. Ideas have been developing. Before this file there are
another 12 based on Pepper Carrot stuff. They are unedited, first drafts for
a novel. When it finally comes to editing the three novels together there
needs to be a wealth of content to draw from. Of course there is going to be
three novels. There has to be three. Not going to focus on the magic heavly.
more litery than fantasy.
The spiders were really interesting. One of them wore glasses. They sat at the
end of his nose. His face looking at the orb in front of him. It was flashing
brightly. 1. 2. 3. Drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have drawn you a picture that I drew recently when I was on holiday. I had
my Portable Pi Digital Artist Wordstation. Complete with the offical
touch screen from Pi Foundation, Wacom drawing tablet and pen, and a Raspberry
Pi 2b computer. All this was being powered by the cased battery pack. The Pi,
monitor and drawing tablet were attached to the right arm. There was a place
to secure the pen also. Was able to draw by holding the pen with left arm and
draw with the Wacom tablet, able to see what is being created on the touch
screen. Art created is moved to a folder where a blog post is generated.
Reflect on the artwork. Give updates to how drawing is going. For example
switching from a3 to a4 and reducing brush size 20px to 10px. Switch to larger
16 gig SD card. Need to format current sd card. Plug in new 16gig sd card and
pi3. Need to find a screwdriver that would do this for. When I save it need
to keep typing for another minute or so. After which how the hell can someone
get 50,000 words in the first day. You must start at midnight and just go all
night. Stopping only for food and toilet. No sleep and before the clock
stricks midnight hit 50,000 words. How many words is that per minute? Get a
generater to generate a book with social trends. Twitter trends are prompts.
Likely lots about american politics and war. Anyway I wouldn't mind some
prompts. They could be helpful to get me through some of the slower days. Today
certainly isn't one of those days!
It's hard to know when to stop really. It's very peaceful out here to get
stuff done.  Currently only Carrot is here distracting me. I'm sitting on my
chair typing on the keyboard. He jumps up on the table and walks around the
table - very carefully. Each paw touchs the  same spot as he strives around
in a cirle like a model walking out on stage. catwalk.  Getting tired and cold
out here and want to go read War and Peace. It is a long read. Currently 30%
through the book. Enjoying it. Nice mix of romance and action. Well thoughtout
and exacuted. This is not going to add more points to your score but it will
help by the time you get to the next day. Still push yourself and get that
goal done quickly. How quick this time can you hit 50,000. Last time you did
it finished with several days free to write more and nothing on two days. Was
sick of writing. Have been writing quite a bit in March - warmup. Will hit
goal then might get sick of it. See how it goes. The incests are biting my
angles. It hurts and is annoying. This makes me want to go inside. I don't
even know what the time is and have no way of finding out unless I go inside.
Need to go toilet. The lemon trees need it.
The light shone behind the armchair. The old man sat in the chair His eyes
fixed on the television. A game of rugby was being streamed to his monitor.
It was 24 hours of unique spots matches. All live. Able to time switch if
it if you want. It was almost half time and the old man would have supper
during the break. In his younger days this was a beer and a bucket of potatoes.
The Irish was rich in his blood. Never meet the old-old man. Stories told about
him and like to tell stories about him. Write a novel about irish coming to
new zealand.  Fleeing the church. 'Work' trip to nz. No money so shovel fuel
for trip. Also has to clean and cook. Has workers/staff dorm. Food and
bunked bed room.
Pepper ordred a home that she could put together herself. The majority of it
was printed with her 3d printer. They are cheap and it's common for homes
to have multiply 3d printers. The old man sat with his glass of juice and
chewing his choclate chip cookies. They had just been cooled from freshly
baked in the oven. The choclate chips were large and gooey. His dog was
stretched down in front of him. The fireplace had die out but the warm heat
still kept the room cosey.
wow and pepper didn't even copy anything from a novel today. Fun doing sketches
of same buildings as i did few years ago. Back then had sketchbook wide and
clutch pencil. Sat in same seats as last time. This time have pi. Problems
with eyes. Feel the need to close one and things arnt clear. For closeup
take glasses off and read. The text is more clear with my glasses off. Can
read the smallest type from a distance. Would like to read from a greater
distance naturally without glasses. Will my vision ever be perfect for distance?
The old man missed the 2nd half of the sport. He got himself distracted in
the kitchen. What was he making at this hour. The scores had changed in the
sports match and the team that was losing is now ahead. This made the old
man grumple. The dog had moved now. It was lying on the couch.
"Cats and Dogs can sleep on grass but what they really want is a couch", said
the old man.
"love me, love me, say that you love me", the music playing out of the
televion. The music was playing on everyones cellphone. zombie rugby player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>letter</category><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/campnanowrimo-day01.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2016 02:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot12</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot12.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is the final day of March.

A stone wall protected
the city. The entrance was steps leading up to a large stone pillar.
The stake of the great tree weaved below the stone walls. The stalks had grown
thick and tough. People had built houses on the stalks. The city had grown
to over population and extension helped. Markets and shops considered
expanding their presence into these areas. They only traded above
the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a floating island that houses only the cities riches residents.
Their houses are large. There are no shops but they have chefs and cooks
on hand for meals - plus servants they can send to the markets for more
food. Many didn't need to leave their home. They were happy living amongst
the clouds. Above those living on the floating korama city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unknown the event that started the war between Magmah and Aquah but
Hereva was changed because of it. Both schools enlisted aid from any
other schools.  The schools were dragged into years of conflict.
The house Hippiah attempted  to stay neutral but the starvation and famine
was so great they supplied Magmah with food. Chaosah was at the height of
their powers. They played both schools against each other. At the height of
the war Zombiah used their magic to animate and re-animate both mechanical
constructs and fallen warriors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The High Council of Ah remained silent for the majority of the war. Once
Zombiah began-animating fallen warriors Ah took notice. Once Ah become
involved with the conflict the fighting ceased. Remaining remember from the
magic schools were assembled and a treaty was brokered. The results of
what are stored in a magic lock-box visible only to select member's of the
schools. The treaty brought an end to thee fighting and bloodshed that had
long plagued Hereva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The High Council of Ah come to the decision that both Magmah and Aquah were
to blame for the conflict. The punishment was the houses suffer the ultimate
shame of being renamed by the other school. Magmah renamed Aquah as
Warrgarblah. Aquah renamed Magmah as Kielbasah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the treaty was  signed Zombiah focused on animating constructs and
creating stronger materials. It is unknown if Ah was responsible for Zombiah
change in focus, or if it became uneconomical to re-animate the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper and Carrot live in a  house overlooking  the  forest near the village
of Squirrels End. The house is fused with together  with trees of the forest
with conventional building  materials.  It is unclear if the  house  is
magically entwined with  a tree or if the tree  grew  around the house.
Perhaps both  as  the tree continues to grow around  the house.  Outside the
house  is   a mailbox with the number  '33'  and  the sign 'WARNING  - WITCHES
PROPERTY'. Countless  traps  are set thorough the forest.  The  traps are
effective and  have kept the dangers from the  forest and idly curious from
discovering the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little is known who lives in the Witches house but other Witches tutor Pepper
at the house, to bring her up as a 'True Witch of Chaosah'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flora and fauna around Pepper's house tends to exhibit strange behaviours. The
ants near the home ere able to under advance maths as the result of a
potion tossed from Pepper's home. It is believed they took this math and
applied it. One of the outcomes were the orb computer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War and Peace. Leo Tolstoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Pepper had driven off with her son to visit Saffron, the Witch sat for
a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. The Witch, with
her daughter and a large number of guests, was already seated in the drawing
room. The count took  the gentlemen into his study and him showed them his
choice collection of orb computers. From time to time he went out to ask:
"Hasn't she come yet?" They were expecting Cumin ,  a witch distinguished not
for wealth or rank, but for common sense  and frank plainness of  speech.
Cumin was known to all magic schools, and both cities wondered at her,
laughed privately at her rudeness, and told good stories about her, while
none the less all without exception respected and feared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the men's end of the table the talk grew more and more animated. The
wizards told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in
Squirrel's End and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day been
forwarded by courier to the commander-in-chef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wizard was a stout, tall, plethoric, kormona. evidently devoted to the
service and patriotically Squirrel's End. He spoke with a   Kormona
accent "blah blah blah" he spoke this last word with particular emphasis on if
it lay the gist of the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They burst out laughing, and all the guests joined in. Everyone laughed, not
at Cumin's answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this
little girl who had dared to treat Cumin in this fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice.
Before the ices champagne as served round. The band again struck up, the
witch and wizard kissed, and the guests, leaving their seats, where up to
"congratulate" the witch, and reached across the table to clink glasses
with the  wizard, with the children, and with one another. Again the footmen
rushed about, chairs scraped. and in the same order in which they had entered
but with redder faces. the guests returned to the drawing room and to the
wizard's study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it seemed
ready to lift its  tail, jump down  on its soft paws, and begin playing with
the ball of wirsted as a kitten should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready
to dance in the large hall, and the sound of feet and the coughing of the
musicians were heard from the gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Jazz band was playing that night. All the cool kids would be there. Pepper,
Saffron, Cumin and others. It was the kind of event someone wouldn't dream of
missing. But people missed the event. The unlucky ones. Those that did
attend the band that evening had a wonderful time.
The band were  completely improvise. They just played their instruments together.
It was completely instrumental  and there were no vocals. The crowd were happy
with the music. Several couple were swinging together on the dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Pepper, I cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. you command
only my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my
order. You are causing me to  lose the fruits  of a campaign. Break the
armistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him that the general
who signed the capitulation had no right to do so, and that no one
but the Emperor had that right. If, however, the Emperor ratifies that
convention, I will ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the
army... You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.
The Emperor's aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are nothing when they have
no powers this one had none... The Austrians let themselves be tricked at
the crossing of the bridge, you are letting yourself be tricked by an
aide-de-camp of the Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soldiers scattered over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were  building shelters with merry
chatter andlaughhter; around the fires sat others, dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg bands or mending boots or overcoats and crowding
round the boilers  and porridge cookers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wizard was sitting in the drawing-room where Cumin had engaged him, as
a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in which
several others
joined but which bored the wizard. When the music began  Pepper came in and
walking straight up to the wizard, laughing and blushing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this a sudden change evidently took place in the witches' ideas; her thin
lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice  when she
began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself evidently did
not expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper had been browsing free ebooks on the Amazon store. She had downloaded
a bunch  of public domain books. One of these was War and Peace by Leo
Tolstory. Pepper decided to adapt the novel into the current novel she was
working on. There is a war that takes place between the houses in the
pepper&amp;amp;carrot web comic story. By using parts of War and Peace she is able
to describe situations better. It also serves as an excellent learning
resource. How much of the text needs to be changed? Sometimes it's just
character names, sometimes there are no changes. Experimenting with writing
techniques such as letter writing. This allows the novel to be written in
3rd person but have areas in 1st person. Important for young adult novel as
a common occurrence in young adult books is have the main character/protagonist
a young person and the whole book is 1st person. For a challenge write a young
adult book in first person. Maybe through the eyes of character in Pepper and
Carrot. Prompts for CampNaNoWriMo. Follow the twitter stream of sprints.
Continue rewrite of public domain and creative commons works. Whatever happens
set daily word counts. 2000 is a nice number. In November it was common to
easily reach over 2000 words. Why not make it a minimum word count?
Today had been a hard day for Pepper to reach her word count. Recently she
had been able to reach 2000 words easily. Today was a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot11.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2016 23:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot10</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot10.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The axe slipped and of off his left leg. The Witch made a new leg out of
tin. The leg worked well once the man adjusted. Again the axe slipped and
the
mans right leg was chopped off. The Witch made another leg  out of tin.
The echanted axe cut off the mans arms. The witch made the man new arms
from tin. The head was the next to be removed by the the enchanted axe. The
Witch was  able to fix that with a tin head.
The  man thought he  had  beaten  the council. The axe sliped again and
cut the tinman  in  half. The Witch created a body from tin. The Tinman was
missing his heart. His entire  body had been replaced by circuit boards. A
network of servers talking to each other. The result is a humanold  robot
automonus. The man lost all his love for the girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;body shone brightly in the sun. Did not matter now if axe slipped. Could not
cut him. Only one danger - that his joints would rust. Kept an oil can in
his cottage and took care to oil change him whever needed. A day when he
forgot to this. Caught in a rainstorm. Joints rusted rapidy in the wet weather.
Stood in the same spot for a year. Until the traveling group had rescured
him. The Tinman decided to join the traveling group and seek out a new heart.
Perhaps then he will love the girl.
What most worried Pepper was that her breaad was  nearly gone, and another
meal for herself and Carrot would empty the basket. She could  not live
unless fed.
Pepper and her companions had been walking through tick woods. The road was
still  paved with brick,  but these were covered by dried  branches and dead
leaves.  The walking surface  was uneven.
There were  few birds in the area of the forest. The birds loved
open country where there is plenty of sunshine. A deep growl was heard from
a wild animal hidden among the trees. These sounds made Peppers heart beat
fast, for she did not know what they were. Carrot knew, walking close to
Pepper.
"How long will it be," Pepper asked of the Tin Woodman, "before we are out
of Squrrials End?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I cannot tell," Tin andwered, "for I have never been to the city of Kormona.
But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it was a long
journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the city where
he dwells the country is so beautiful. But I am not afraid so long as I have
my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the other, while you bear upon your  forhead
the mark of the The True Witch of  Chaosa's kiss, and that will protect you
from harm".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He is my cat, Carrot," answered Pepper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Is is made of tin, or stuffed?" the bearded man asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Neither. He's a--a--a meat dog," said Pepper.
"Oh! He's a curious animal and seems remarkable small, now that I  look at him.
No one would think of hurting it, except a corward like me," continued the man&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What makes you a coward"? asked Pepper, looking at the giant man  in  wonder,
for he was as big as a small horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's a mystery," replied the man. "I suppose I was born that way. All the
others in the forest naturally expect me to be brave. If I yelled loudly
everythng living would be frightened and move out of the way. Whenever I've
met someone and I've been awfully scared. Just a yell and  the person runs
away. Of course I  let them escape".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But that isn't right. You shouldm't be a coward" said Pepper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I know it", returned the man, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail. "Itis my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper had enough writing for the day. She had reached for word count for the
day. Her project was part of the copyright paper she was taking. It invoved
the task on using material either in public domain or creative commons,
remixing the content and sharing the new material created. Pepper decided to
write a novel for her project. She merged together a range of materal -
beginning with the Pepper&amp;amp;Carrot webcomics by authorname, creative commons
resources, the wizard of oz. By using a range of material content would be
easy to write. By sampling a range of content the work is already done. It's
just about merging it togther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the riverbanj a tree full of fine fruit. This pleased Pepper, who had
eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe
fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper awoke from her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly
astonished to find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing
arpnd and looking at her timily. But the  Scarecrow tod her about everything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:
"ermit me to introduce you her Majesty, the Queen."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper nodded gravely and the Queen made a cursty, after which she beame
quite friendly with the little girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mice were fasten to the truck. All mice had been harnessed, they were able
to pull it eaily. They could sit on it and were drawn swiftly by their
horses to where the man lay asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a great deal of hard work, for the man was heavy they manage to get him
up on the truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper needed a break. She was 39% through The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. It's
an excellent written book. It's been fun for her to mix the worlds of
Wizard of Oz and Pepper&amp;amp;Carrot together. This was only posible because
of public domain and creative commons.  As a learning resource go take a
book or 2 and remix them into a new, unique novel. Look at joining some
online writing group. Even better join a local one then connect with those
online. Regular meetups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you ever need us again," she said, "come out into the field  and call, and we
shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good-bye!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Good-bye!" they all answered,  and aay the Queen rran, while Pepper held
Carrot tightly lest he  should run after her and  frighten her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crow brought Pepper some fruit from a tree near by, which she ate for her
dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have always though myself very big and terrible; yet as such little things
as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as micee have saved my life.
How strange it all is! But, compades, what shall we do now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"WWe must journey on until we find  the road of brick again," said Pepper,
"and then we can  keep on to Kormona."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Warrior being fully refreshe, and feeling quite like himself again, they
started upon the journet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I want him to give me some brains," said Crow eagerlyl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh, company could do that easily enough," declared the man.  "He has more
brains than he needs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And I  want him to give me a heart," said Tin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone had they requests for what they wanted. Pepper character wants to
return home. Man wants courage. Tin wants heart. Crow wants
Pepper just wants to finish highschool. This is just a story of her project.
Mix the subjects around. Has to attend a conference   and  speak. Can be
lightning talk. Slides must be used. Recommend 1 slide  per minute talk.
Q and A is fine, maybe even doing the whole talk in a Q&amp;amp;A setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has been writen in March serves as a prologue. For the month of April the
aim is for 50,000 words. The event is Camp NaNoWriMo. This will be   1,667
words per  day. There is no planning ahead on the novel. The only planning
was  a title. It started as peppercarrot  then  changed to peppercarrotcopyright.
I  had though of peppercarrotdeath.
Then again, it is  a trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper, Carrot, Crow,  Tin,  Man  are the traveling party in the novel that
pepper is writing. Pepper, Carrot and Cumin are the characters traveling
snow. Each version  of Pepper studies something different. Reader is given
the info that Pepper  learns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the outcome in  the end of the  first book? 2nd? third?  Made to thin
it is going to be normal story pace but then novel 'changes'. How does this
change happen? Can it be done without being lame?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protaginst is 14 years old therefore it is a young adult novel. More
resolution takes place than a adult novel. Shift the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orbs. Now only 35 gold. With a built in 3d touch display the new single board
quad  core computers were  selling like hotcakes. Ever child  in Hevena and
their father wanted one of these devices. It was  running a custom build of
the Debian Linux ARM system.
Loading it with a free operating system meant that it was able to be sold
cheaper. The company behind the orb was a non-profit based in the UK. One
of the founders noticed a lack of university enterence students with
computer skills. The Orb was created as an education tool. A way of getting
people intereste in computers and getting them to create stuff rather than
just consume.
The orb was made to be tinkered with. People were encrourged to build new
and exciting creations with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death was interested in the orb. He didn't get time off often but when he did
he enjoyed playing video games or watching movies with his orb. He hadn't
tinkered with the system and built something unique. Death had always wanted
to tinker with systems but the education was poor when he was in school. It
wasn't the teachers fault. Technology was moving so quickly they needed indrustyleaders to teach the teachers, then the teachers teach the children.
"I'm not sure if this is going to work. It is worth a go" said Death.
An orb machine had broken. it had been overclocked and the processer heated
up. This didn't matter, you could just buy a new orb and place the SD card
into the new orb. Sometimes the SD cards failed. It was  easy to keep a
backup of them. Post companies also offered services of backup methods.
Able to withdraw private and  public keys via  ATM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A volunteer from Creative Commons Hevena came to Peppers Orphanage in Squrrials
End to speak to all the teachers in the area. The Witches Instrutue of
Education had bunddled together teachers from various schools that were
interested in licensing and getting Creative Commons policys into schools.
Oh that's what this novel will be called. Creative Commons in Schools. It
will tell of a journey of copyright infringment to sharing, remixing, and
adapting of works. Teachers around Hevena would no longer break copyright
by sharing the resources they are creating. The copyright belongs to the
board of trustess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Witches squeezed into the orphange conference room. It could fit around
800 souls. The place was packed. Several Witches were flying on their
broomsticks - unable to decided where to sit. Several decided to stay
perched upon their brooms. This made it hard for those in a seat to see.
The speaker was introduced and walked out on stage. Their slides appeared.
They spoke clearly and confidently about the subject. They were in fact
terrified but it didn't show. Never had they spoken in front of this many
people. So many well educated and able to sense any fault.
The crowd  went  wild with laughter and aookiuse,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning about Creative Commons build digital citizenship. Founded by fellas.
that wanted to see an altenative to copyright. It's not even tested. Copyright
hasn't been around for long. It was created in a attempt to protect creations
that people make. Has big Stop you may not use this sign, People go crazy over

They thrive on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>creative commons</category><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot10.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot09</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot09.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pepper and Carrot and Copyright&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sometime he had been searching for web comics that could be remixed. The
copyright works of Jem was remixed into new artworks but none of her comics
were taken into a written form. Maybe something to explore?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the site DeviantArt the web comic Pepper&amp;amp;Carrot was discovered. This
was instant inspiration. Upfront he knew he could remix this as permission had
been granted in advance. If the works hadn't been under a Creative Commons
licence then the remix wouldn't of happened. There is no way the artist who's
work is under copyright will be contacted and permission seeked to use the
work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a novel about witches, technology, and copyright. It's a children
novel with fantasy, science fiction, and historic fiction influence.  The
fantasy comes from the witches world of hevena, science fiction for the
copyright licences  and tech, historic fiction for creating a medieval world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempts have been made to keep true to the Pepper and Carrot universe.
Excising characters  and stories developed instead of fresh. This helps
with linking the web comic  with the  novel. Influences have  also  been
taken from Fan Fiction writing of Pepper&amp;amp;Carrot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A co-author would be fun to work work. Maybe  someone that will give a  basic
plot or  senerial and I  can expand  from there. This is why web comic is an
excellent trigger. Able to write about images - colours, objects, characters,
environments - everything that is displayed in the web comic  can be transferred
to text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper had transformed her home. No longer was it empty with modem technology
but now devices were scatted around her home. Her main reason to use the
tech was to improve her productivity of magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spiders had decided of a one orb per orphan. It was a goal to get old orbs
refurnished and given to the orphans around Hevena that had nothing.
The spiders adjusted his glasses with a twitch of  a nose. Out of the corner
of their eye they saw two figures enter the room. In the zone they didn't
want to  be  distracted by intruders. Smashing the keys the bugs in the
software  were removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How people access information has radically changed. Until recently most of
archival items were largely unknown. Rich resource that includes photos,
newspapers,  oral histories and maps. Requests for resources that took up
valuable staff time and "put people off using the images". Someone that leans
towards openness. Material coming in digital form only. Digitise the material
and let the donors keep the original. Building material with this system.
"Our focus  has been on accessibility, rather than reuse. Releasing images of
the collection for download is now a core part of the work flow of copyright
assessment. Providing the  highest-resolution image file means wider scope
for reuse. "Let's iterate!".
Start with what you  do now, at the bottom of the mountain. Don't worry at
what's at the top. It might be solved on the trip, if it doesn't concentrate
better on solving at the top.
Internal efficiency savings. New clearer copyright and open licensing  statements
mean less confusion, less worry about inadvertently doing something illegal,
and less time taken up processing rights requests and queries. Cut through the
copyright bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper wanted to become a IP and copyright witch. She would fight for justice
in the courts and side with witches that shared their creations. For too long
laws had sweep over them that didn't give them permission to share the resources
they were creating. There had been several reports of copyright infringement
at the school. The outcome was the death of several witches - all by burning.
As they are being burnt the Hevena Copyright Law is read aloud to them.
Not only are their last moments on the planet painful, they are also filled
with lawyers preaching. After the final burning screams of the witches fade
the final passage is read. "ALL RIGHTS RESERVED".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper had defensive security in place in case the ip and copyright police
raided her. She had been receiving death threats over her latest potions.
A large company was accusing Pepper of breaking patents. Pepper argued back
that like software spell and potion patents were wrong. She had been working
on getting spell and potion patents banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was copyright that first started the war between the two houses. One Earth
based and the other water. They accessed each other of copyright infringement.
The whole case  went over the top. Billions of tax payers money was spent on
fighting, countless lives on both sides were lost. The documents contained in
the parel being shipped  was trademark and bonds  shares of the world.
Everything that a copyright logo could be attached to was in this file. It
contained the meta data to all of pepper&amp;amp;carrot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The black and white C logo glowed brightly on the opening screen. It always
appeared at this moment, much to Peppers frustration. It started it fade.
At last it was time for Pepper and Carrot to enter the scene. Those with
the logo Pepper and Carrot below their portrait. Both Pepper and Carrot had
large gleaming their  smiles. Both had shining white teeth - with Carrots
being extra sharp. The two held their pose at the scene contained. Next a
range of stages would be setup. There were several choices. Peppers home.

be any of the choices - it depended on the scene. The whole show was improve.
Live actors with rough scripts - or guidelines. Nothing was truly planned
and the  actors were encouraged to develop new story.
The actress that played Pepper was recently replaced. There had been a terrible
accident and the actress had died. Whenever a actor dies they need to be
replaced. Sometimes it can be hard to find a new actor. this time it was
easy. The company advertised the job on various actor message replied - and
got dozens of replies from young ladies  (and a few men) that believed they
would make a perfect Pepper actor. The interviews took time. Those that had
a high and low chance of the job were moved into the next process with all
the middle thrown out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had travelled with her Mother to the audition. They wanted to do it for the
experience, nothing else. It  was  a  nice Mother and daughter activity to do.
Audition for a television show. The company had thought about using lookalikes
for the actors but the  detail wasn't precise enough. They needed exact
clones. The  company had been experimenting with cloning but it  had been
a failure. The funded was keeping the research alive. Scientists were able
to study the process and release the results under a open licensed document.
In the entrance foyer to the school a TV glared with sports playing. The
sports were muted with light background music being played in the background.
It wasn't too loud and allowed people to hear each other and not boring as
silence. There were options. Music pauses when someone speaker. This was
popular amongst many. "GET OUT OF THE WAY", being yelled would be heard as
the elevator jazz would be paused and the booming voice would injected.
There was a global channel that people were  in - off this were various
alternative channels. The system was built on the music genooue project. The
engine and data was open sourced and received a boost of contributes.
At first they thought the project was going to fail but it was boosted to
full health when the transition to open source occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No idea where this is going. Almost April so Camp NanoWriMo begins. Goal is
35,000 rough draft childrens/young adult novel. Idea was to work on Pepper and Carrot
themed novel. Warming up with writing about them in March. Take the works
written in March and have a goal of 50,000 words - 15,000 words from the
month of March. Have activies and plans for helping generate novel.
Read webcomic. Write about whats happening in the panels that you believe
are most important. Free to test as many different writing styles as posible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main character of the story is a 14 year old witch named Pepper. She owns a
cat called Carrot. He is a fluffy orange coloured cat. The novel begins when
Pepper arrives at the witches orphanage in Squirals End. She is dropped off at
the house with a suitcase,  a orb, and her cat - Carrot. As she walks to the
front door she can see the magic moving around  her. This area of Hevena was
hit hard by the nector. It changed stuff. Made everything better. stronger.
more productive. happier. a pig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel followed Pepper and Carrot through training to become
a fully qua;ified witch. One of the subjects that Pepper studies is
copyright.
She does this through reading about creative commons and applying  the
licence to some content she makes.
This is not a historic fiction. This is not a science fiction. This is not
a fantasy novel.
Lets make stuff creatives commons. How to do it? Get the words. Get the image.
Include this on any work under a creative commons licence. Use a licence
generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper  was  the choosen witch of chaorsa. Decides to not fulfill a destiny,
but instead is smart and resourceful. She is an orphan. This novel is a
trilogy.

Romance, thriller, horror, science fiction, historic fiction.
coming-of-age story. Adult reader that have trouble buying into a magic system.
Story that explores the character with a little magic in the background.
If story straddles between literary and fantasy, capture this audience.
Why does the magic system work how it does? How did it come about?
These are questions that will be touched on. First book is the first two year
of Pepper at the orphange. Second book is third and fourth. Third and final
book is her sixth year and life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story about a girl named Pepper. She had recently become a orphan
and had arrived at the  orphanage with all the other orphan children. Life
was horrible. Food was rare. The water was dirty. People were dying the
city. Famine had spread. The crops at the farms in Squrrials End were dead. The
animals disease ridden and sick. Infections spread amongst the cities. It
couldn't be controled. It spread till life was scarse. It was foretold that
a witch would rise and become a True Witch of Chaoseha - cure and purge the
evil and sickness. Strike down with holy vengence. Praise the lord. The yell
echoed the Church room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Talk like that could get you killed", Pepper spoke.
The other Witchs mouth quivered. Pepper had shut her up. The troops needed to
be kept in place. Otherwise they would have no rules and wont do what is asked
of them. Churches had been outlawed by the council. They saw them as a threat.
The church that Pepper and Saffron were standing in was one of the last remainding
churches. If the council discovered the church they would burn it down. It
would make headline news if it did. It had been almost ten years since the
last church was burnt down. The footage was always shown with the tunes
the tiger lillies start a fire playing. This footage was played on repeat
on some channels till today. Other mainstream channels play it during the
adbreak. The footage of the church burning is followed by selfie images of
Jesus Christ being killed. A selfie stick was placed above him and people
could pay to get a photo (or five) with the dying man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advancment of the witches spells and potions crypto had become
useless as spells would be able to attack the code. Through reverse
engineering the work could be cracked. This caused panic. Packets could be
encrupt and private keys forged. It was unspeakable of the harm it could do.
That's why the war happened. It was a bunch of witches fighting over zeros
and ones. The security of the Hevena people. From those farmers in Squrriels
End to those rich merchants and bakery owners. Guilt sank in Saffrons
face. Of the floating city of Komarha. The annoucment continued.
"ALL WITCHES REPORT TO YOUR CELL LEADER", the announcment voice boome. The
quality of the speakers were not high. The prison had forbitt the use of
audio packages - giving the excuse that it was a security threat. No one had
ever successfully escaped from the prison. Since the uproar the prison had
been turned into a camp for witches. Somewhere the council were able to lock
them away. Those that attempted to escape where killed, along with anyone
that may of assisted them in their escape. When being torched they were
asked to name and kill those that helped them escape. The one that attempted
to escape was killed in the end- after much pain. Life was not good for the
witches. The portal between the magical world of Hevena and Earth had been
open - both people and animals from each world entered the others world.
On Earth the Witches were treated like the devil and burnt to death. Ther was
no nice policy. Those waiting to be burnt lived in the prison camps. Here they
were forced to work and create goods that was then sold by the concil at high
price with little of  the profits given back to the prisoneer. Some considered
it slavee labour. Groups around the world were in support of the witches and
several humans were caught attempting to enter a witch prison camp. They weere
unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The witch conquered the Hevena and tyrannically ruled over the world after
the fall of the King. Ebchanced weapons that caused those that used them to
cut their own bodies.

The Storm. Pepper is flying her broom. Carrot is perched
behind Pepper. It is late afternoon and the sun was about to set. The broom
travelled towards Peppers home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What a nice day we had visiting the girls. I really want to arrive home
now and have a relaxing bat", Pepper explains to Carrot.
In the distance big, dark clouds form. A flash of lightning blinds the night
sky. This is most disturbing for Pepper. Strong wind that caused trees to
snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper lands in her front yard. Leaves and objects are twisting around. The
two rush inside and take refuge. There are a group of other animals that they
find and join. Only those that formed groups survived.   The place is crowded with
animals. Outside the storm gets worse. In the morning when they go outside
find the town been destroyed by the storm. Needed to rebuild the witches
house. Rebuild it as a conference centre. Hotel on site. Tall building filled
with a range of rooms. Self contained. Fibre Ethernet. Bed(optional), Desk
(optional), bathroom(optional, custom), kitchen(optional).
Custom design the room. Power charge, server room. Encrypted data of
everything created.
"I know", Pepper yells, "I will make a stone golm as Coriander taught me".
The young witch held out her wand. Her hand was shaking. She had never
summoned something this difficult before. Carrot had placed the stone and
ingredients in place. All Pepper needed to do was wave her wand and say that
magic chant. She had practice it millions of times. It was easy. Pepper
waved her wand, the words flowing from her mouth. A flash of light and
the rocks that Pepper had been pointing at rearranged themselves. They melted
and formed a humanoid figure.
The golem is commanded by Pepper to remove the tree the is trapping
another animal. Badger is free after the golam moves the tree.
Pepper decides to the the golem shopping so that the golem lifts the
heavy items - cauldron, chair, desk, bed, and the mushrooms.
Pepper was able to spend  money she had won at potions contest on the
new gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group of travellers passed through a villa. It was certainly luxurious.
In a the front a maze of a garden leading to the front door. In the centre
of the maze is a fountain and a pond. It is very popular for swimmers.
The group walk past the front door. The golem is staring intensively at
something. The close up shows a winab nade if stone. She was beautiful.
She had a Greek resemblance about her. Pepper notices the golem looking
at the motionless statue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Do you like her?", Pepper asks.
"OK, I will turn her into a golem also. Then you can both help me carry
this shopping home". Pepper waves her wand and speaks those magical words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two golems held hands and carried Peppers shopping down the streets.
A man in expensive clothing approached the travelling group. He was angry
because they had stolen the golem from his garden. Now when he looked out
his window the golem is gone, and he liked to look at the golem very much.
Now he had tracked down and found the golem here on the streets of the city.
The man is rich and has bribed the city guards to arrest the travelling group.
He ordered the city guards and the guards rush forward towards the travelling
party. The group splits and rushes off, fighting off the guards.
Pepper stands on a hilltop over looking the battle. "Beware", She begins to
yell, "For he is fearless, and therefore powerful". Her wand points towards
the enemy. Bright flash of light travels forward, disabling an enemies in
the path.
The sun  is setting. The two golems still holding hands starng into anothers
eyes. Their movements are jerky and slow. They are turning to stone again and
are lifeless. The man stops yelling and realised that the golems were in love.
A fountain appeared around the two golems with water running through it.
Pepper is sad because it is dark and she has shopping that she needs to take
home but both her golems had turned to stone. The rich man helps carrot and
orders a taxi to take her and the shopping home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land was covered by snow. Two figure walk through the snowy weather -
their identities hidden in the snow. Above the two figures is a bat. flying
above.
The taller of the group has a barrier tied to their back. They are walking
with the wind and snow spraying into their face. Holding an arm up to block
the weather. The travellers walk towards a wooden house. Smoke is emerging
from the chimney. Light glowed out the windows. Inside of house. The snow
covered figures step through the front door. The room turns and watch as the
figures shake snow from their clothes. The bartender greets them with a large
smile, "Welcome to the Prancing Unicorn", he greets them. "Are you here for
the challenge of the wise of the Mountain?", the man asks the group.
The tall figure finally reveals - it is Pepper. The bartender asks them
if the need a room for the night. Pepper agrees and  requests a cauldron for
the room. She is offered a jug of beer but declines and asks for hot chocolate
instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the main dining hall  the travelling group take  a seat. The
waitress delivers three hot chocolates to the group. Pepper, Carrot,
and Cumin thank the waitress and begin to drink their chocolate.
The barrel that Pepper was carrying is sitting on the table. Around the room
people are looking at the group and whispering.
Pepper over hears some of the remarks the room is speaking.
"Impossible... This little girl? She will never make it. None have climbed
the mountain in eight years". The chatter was upsetting for Pepper. She was
worried.
"Do you think we can make it?", Pepper asks Carrot. She is worried that
Cayenne is going too far with 'do not use magic'. Doubt spreads through
Peppers mind. Cumin examples to Pepper that it would of been best to leave
the broom at home so there is no chance of cheating.
"The Mountain of the perpetual snow is a test that anyone considering herself
worth of respect accomplishes at least once in her  life", Cumin tells Pepper.
A tall mountain with a thin path leading to the top. Clouds grow  thick in
the upper area. Above the clouds, the peak of the mountain stands.
It has been known as the home of a wise man, a hermit that lives on the top
of the mountain. He receives visitors only once a year.
An elderly man sits on a tall stone throne covered in snow. The man stares at
the warrior bowing before him. A barrel similar to Peppers barrel is sitting
beside him.
It  is  said the first to reach the throne on the final day of February with
a barrel filled at 'Prancing Unicorn', will reclieve a gift from the man
upon the throne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Catholic roaming the country in search of God. They found him. He was
in the sky, in Market Street San Francisco, and Dean had God sweating out of
forehead all the way. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OUT FOR THE HOLY MAN: HE MUST
SWEAT FOR GOD. And once he has found Him, the Godhood of God is forever
Established and really must not be spoken about. Misinterpreted as a tale
of companions out looking for kicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper and Carrot hid behind an old tree. It's branches had little leaves
left. Thyme was nearby. She had just landed with her broom outside the cave.
Pepper and Carrot were watching the witch - careful that they were not
spotted. Thyme walked into the cave. Pepper and Carrot crept closer to the
cave. Inside bright coloured light reflected. Thyme was sitting in front of
a magical orb. It was glowing a purple colour. After sometime Thyme switched
the orb off with a switch on the side. Pepper and Carrot hid on he entryway
to the cave - careful that Thyme didn't spot them on her way out. They watched
as Thyme mounted her broomstick and took off into the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper and Carrot went inside the cave. Pepper switched on the orb. A purple
light raised from the orb. The image on the orb showed a young wizard wearing
nothing but a purple scarf around his waste. He had blonde hair and a well
built body. Yellow stars and moons scatted the scarf. Pepper face turned
pink in embarrassment of the images. She was quick to close it and open up a
endless runner game - involving a unicorn. The light being admitted by the
orb was a light blue. The light switched to red as  they reached the next
level.   As  they were playing the game crashes - causing a dark blue to
be admitted from the monitor. They were worried they had broken it. Looking
up a  giant spider stood above them. One of the spiders legs was in the air.
It was moving towards Pepper and Carrot. The two were frightened of the spider
and hided together. The leg was brought down - not on Pepper and Carrot -
but on the orb. The orb rebooted and a black screen with green text
was displayed. The game that Pepper and Carrot were playing was displayed.
This made the two happy. Holding the spiders web Pepper and Carrot followed
the spider. It lead them into the server room. Here another spider was
installing new systems on broken orbs. Each image displayed text and images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spider in room with a long gray beard and large dark rimmed glasses was
typing away and his workstation. Six monitors displaying pixels sat in front
of the spider. The spider sat on a stone seat. It looked like it had been
carved out of the cave. A white web ran from the workstation to the centre
back of the room. The web ran down the long cave foyer area. Below a river
of water. The connections caused to glow a bright yellow. This contrasted
on the dark blue atmosphere the spiders had created. Pepper and Carrot are
shown how the system created by the spiders was created. They explained how
the technology had been developed by the ants and passed onto them. The
ants had moved on with their technology and were exploring other worlds. The
spiders were assisting them on their mission.
After the ants came into   contact with the genius potion their technology
rockets. They build ships that  send ants and other insects to space.
Developed AI system that is used by Hevena. Ants mix together schools of
magic with their advance math.
What would   quick math acceleration look like? What would be the effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that the screen flashed to a dialog box that said they had learnt
enough for now and should take a break, maybe thing over and discuss what
they have learnt up to this point.
Pepper and Carrot looked at each other in fascination at what they had learnt.
They had  been taught about copyright and how it's there to protect the artist
from being ripped off. The licence did more bad than good. Creative Commons
as they understood it, was a hack on copyright. It allowed those that held

A group of skeleton warriors charged
at the group of witches. Coriander posed battle ready in the centre. Welding
a buster sword with two hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after the party Pepper woke late inn the morning. The sky was a bright
blue with a few scatted clouds.
At the front door Pepper and Carrot discovered signals of the mountains, the
forest, and the clouds? The two wondered why security had been activated.
Then Pepper remembered. She had forgotten to disable the security systems and
her party guests had been detained. Pepper and Carrot travelled on the broom
to each of the trapped guests. First they found Saffron who was lifted into
the air with a branch from the ancient tree. The tree laughed as Pepper
apologised to Saffron and released her. She was not impressed.
The next witch that Pepper and Carrot discovered was Coriander. Her leg was
chained to a friendly giant mountain. Along the top soil lay with green grass
sprouting out.
Pepper asked them if they had a good night, besides the light rain.
"Everyone is safe, no harm done, right?", Pepper asks for forgiveness.
She tells them she has  prepared tea and invite the witches home.
They are annoyed with Pepper but follow her home anyway - they are all
thirsty after a night of being trapped by the security system.
The way the other witches were looking at Pepper was upsetting for her. Pepper
heard them whispering nasty remarks - especially Saffron.
The witches pets wanted to fix this. Together they decided to make
themselves sick, causing Pepper to lead and cure every ones pets. The plan works,
the animals get sick, Pepper cures them. Everyone is happy with Pepper.
One of the side effects of the cure was fur and feather loss. All the animals
are annoyed with Carrot as he didn't tell them this and if he had told them
they would of not gone along with the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrot had ran off and Pepper couldn't find him. She was beginning to worry
about her cats safety. It wasn't like him to run off. Pepper tracked Carrot
deep into the forest. She had never been this deep before. Calling Carrots
name Pepper found the cat sleeping on the grass under a rocky cliff.
As Pepper wakes Carrot a shining blue circle light appeared behind them.
Pepper looks around surprised of the magic happening. The light explodes,
revealing a tunnel where the rocks use to be. Pepper and Carrot had to
follow the tunnel.
The tunnel lead to a blue pool of water with several blue flying creatures
hovering above. The leader of the group welcomes them to  the magical fairy
cave. Pepper and Carrot realise that they have discovered fairies.
The fairies grant them a single wish promising anything they desire.
'anything... ...I desire', Pepper wonders. The ideas of what she would wish
for appear in her head. A new hat and wand, a unicorn, a dress, a doll, gold,
wings, or love. These were just a selection of ideas that Pepper thought of.
Pepper started to ask for her wish, "I... I'd like to", She stumbled.
"uh, what I'd like is that...", Carrot interrupted Pepper with a tired,
"Meow". Immediately Carrot collapsed to sleep. Tne fairies announced the
wish had  been granted and disappeared. Pepper was annoyed with Carrot. The
cat had wasted the one wish on asking to go back to sleep.
What was the effects of the green potion? Used to summon demons into the
world that starts to fight with the flying creature. Need to use potions on
the demons in order to beat the flying creatures. Need to control the demons
around the city wiping out any invading creatures. Fades between war between
houses (water demon invasion), and new war of flying creature vs peppers
demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thick green liquid sat wasted at Peppers home. All she had was a glass
bottle with Carrots urine in. It was from his latest vet visit.
To stop the oversized beast from destroying the city Pepper threatened to pour
the potion on the animal. In disgust the flying creature agreed to leave the
city. Where did it go? What was the outcome of leaving the city? What if
Peppers trick didn't work, instead it took over the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cauldron boiled as Pepper tipped the final ingredients in. It sizzled.
"and the last touch", Pepper annouched to Carrot. He wasn't paying any
attention. Instead Carrot was sleeping.
Pepper tasted the potion. She looked over and asked Carrot if it was strong
enough. Carrot was still  sleeping. Pepper went ahead and poured the rest
of the package into the cauldron. A yellow and  green light blasted from the
pot. A golden liquid spread up - covering several items in Peppers room,
including her broom.
In a attempt to stop it - Carrot jumped into the cauldron. The cat was covered
in the Golden liquid.
Later that night  they entered into a witch race. Pepper wore her goggles and
had the number '18' tapped to the end of her broom. Carrot  floated above the
broom attached with a rope. He wore goggles similar to Peppers.
Both Carrot and the broom were glowing in the night  sky a golden colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's exactly what I need", Pepper told Carrot. The cat looked up from it's
sleeping spot. "CARROT", the witch yelled. Carrot was fully awake now.
"Get ready, we'll hunt the ingredients together". Pepper dragged Carrot from
its bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"First I need a few pearls of mist from those black clouds...", Pepper told
Carrot. The two were flying though a storm. The cloud were so dark and thick
it was impossible to see. Carrot held the net used to catch the pearls.
Pepper needed to travel to the haunted  jungle for red berries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Egg shells from the Phoenix valley of the volcano's and finally a drop of
milk from a young DragonCow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of the potion contest Pepper was finishing her genius potion at
2.00am in the morning. She knew her potion would beat the other witches -
including Saffron. The witch needed to test the potion on someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"CARROT", called Pepper. Her ginger cat would be a perfect test subject.
Opening the window, Pepper yelled into the night sky, "CARROT".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food was used to lure Carrot back home. The ginger  cat was on the outskirts
of the city. Saffrons cat was perched up on a tree. Carrot  had been singing
to  the cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrot burst through his cat door. Pepper picked the cat up with both arms.
'aww, Carrot', Pepper spoke as she held the cat.
"Sweet kitty cat, you've come all by yourself". A wide smile swept over
Peppers face. "At the very moment when I need my favourite assistant".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper had remembered that she needed Carrot to test the potion.
Carrot sat on a pink pillow chair. In front of the cat the owner, Pepper
revealed, "the potion of Genius". Pepper forces Carrot to take a sip of the
potion through a strew. "Do please take a sip", Pepper insists, holding the
straw in the cats mouth. Carrot swallows and ingests some of the blue
liquid. He gains a burst of energy and knowledge then becomes over whelmed and
just wants to sleep. Visions of other universes and planets blast through
the cats mind. On a chalk board Carrot writes E=Mc2. Pepper is shocked when
the cat begins to write. She has no idea of the cats talents. Pepper attempts
to guess what Carrot is writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"E? Energy? Eternal? Emotion?", Pepper attempted to guess what Carrot was
writing. "What else can this mean? Embed? Empty?", Pepper was growing angry
that she couldn't guess it. When Carrot had finally finished Carrot didn't
understand what the cat had written.
Carrots eyes glowed a blue colour and spirals were in replacement of the cats
normal eyes.
"C'mon Carrot, I'm running out of words and this really doesn't make any
sense", Pepper complained. "This really doesn't make any sense". Pepper
turned blue. Clutching the potion the witch growled, yelling "Nothing ever
works for me".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrot had fallen asleep. Pepper decided to throw the potion out the window
and start again. The potion smashed through the window and onto the grass
outside. The blue liquid oozes out of the cracked bottle. It creates a pool
of glowing blue liquid. The liquid effects a group of ants who develop
advance intelligence levels. The liquid effects other animals and begins a
war between insects.  Those ants take the liquid back to their colony,
infected the majority of the ants in the area. They advance to high level
maths and robotics. Create an army of insect robots that are used in the
war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steel waiter robot used for household work. Able to print the robots then
cast a spell of zombifaction to bring it to life. Config file that allows
choice in how the bot works. App to update the robots from device, or
cronjobs. Knows to do certain things. Eg: Get car to return children home
daily. Car is parked at school daily and used for other uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rea can be loosely thought of as collecting the by-products of a task.
By concentrating on making a potion for a loved one the practitioner can
harness some of the Rea used in creating the potion. Conversely if there is no
attachment, or if the practitioner is careless then the Rea is lost and the
Rea must be obtained via other more costly means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rea is used for all aspects of live on Hereva. Farmers in the village of
Squirrel's End use Rea to grow healthier crops. They use Rea to ward off
denizens of the forest. Witches of Hereva find the use of Rea for mere
"chores" beneath them, and reserve their Rea use for more important matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training is one of the schools of magic allows for more controlled and
focused use of Rea. Without this training Rea becomes
more of a "guided intention" rather than a direct command of Rea. By careful
study,focus, and desire one can learn to harness Rea to
conform to their will. As the Herevans learned how to control Rea they quickly
realized this power could cause havoc if not properly taught, and
formed the schools of magic  to properly teach the various ways of harnessing
Rea.
Some schools become more secretive about their methods for controlling Rea ,
while others remained open to all students (mostly from necessity, but some
because of the charters of their founding members). Most of the people of
Hereva know a little bit of the schools of magic they were exposed to.
For example the farmers of Hereva know a diluted form of Hippiah magic passed on from generation to the next. There is a difference in mimicking the magic of a school and knowing all their secret knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rea use must be replenished. It can be replenished in various ways -
meditation
n, focus and dedication of a project. Beware those who claim to have
invented a way to regenerate Rea with effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group of genius ants become known as Savant-Ant. There were affected by
the potion of Genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flying created that landed on Peppers bed when flying to the potion
contest was a Dragon-drake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hornuk is a Demon of Chaosah and is male. He lives in  Dimension Chaosah
but can be summoned for a short time in Hereva's main reality.
Hornuk is a midsize hairy green demon. Horns stick out the top of his
head and long sharp claws are attached to his fingers. The demons favourite
food is cupcakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eyeuk was the next demon to appear from the portal. He was a similar size to
the previous demon, Hornuk. Instead of green hair Eyeuk was covered in red.
He had an extra two eyes and large muscles. Clutched in his hand was a
trident weapon. Eyeuk leads the demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final demon to walk through the portal was Spiduk. The only female in the
group of demons. She is a similar size to her male counter-parts but
spider shaped with a purple glow to her body. She carried with her a cup of
tea, that she was sipping on. In another arm she carried a teapot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theorem-the-Golem was a male Golem that in the Mountain behind Squirrel's
End. He is part of the security systems created by Pepper. Pigeons live with
him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dragonmoose is a male dragon that lives high in the clouds on the top
of the mountains behind Squirrel's End. He's a large and hairy dragon with
a moose shaped head. A very friendly creature. Female Dragonmooose eggs have
a range of colours - from pastel blue to yellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot07.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot06</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot06.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Three Witches  left Pepper and headed into another  room - closing the
door behind them. 'She seems fine', the youngest Witch spoke. The  other two
stood there and steered at the other for sometime. 'The neighbour was not
making it up though, he had  evidence of the events taking place', another
added. The three discussed for sometime how they would deal with Pepper and
the events that had unfolded. Finally they came to a agreement. The three
exited the room and headed towards Pepper.
Pepper stood up from her chair and looked around at her three Godmothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death stood at the door. Leaning against the  wooden frame. He gazed at
Pepper. She stood there, looking back at him.  Her  godmothers  around her.
Death had  yet  to realised that the  neighbour had spotted him walking in the
witches home with Pepper. His jaw dropped when the three witches questioned
Pepper over the event. Death bolted. He left the building. War had failed and
now they were being punished for it. The four horsemen successfully killed
Pepper parents and grandparents. For years Pepper had manoeuvred them.
They had  tracked Pepper down to an orphanage. After her parents  were killed
she was sent here to learn to become a Witch. She was given  a cat that she
named Carrot.
No longer did they have the two magic houses at war with each other, with the
rest of the houses stuck in the middle. The operation was a success but years
later they discovered left overs. Recently returned to the world and attacking
Pepper. Causing her to learn more about her grandparents and parents.
She was the last left in the bloodline. The rest had been hunted down  and
thrown  into Hades.  It was there they were judged in front of the gods and
thrown to hell or allowed into heaven. There has been attempts to return to
the world of Hevena from heaven. Several tried but failed. Once they reached
heaven, there was no escape.
Those that were cast to hell were able to return to the world of the living
and spread Satan's word. It is a horrible job and the pay is lousy.
Some believe that those in hell are given more freedom than those in heaven.
That is until someone escaped from heaven. A rogue Angle attacked heaven
and disabled the security used to stop people escaping. The angel was able
to leave heaven and returned to the world of the living. It was here that
the angel meet a wizard and feel in love. The two had three children.
Another family Saffrons grandparents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Peppers broom her demons had changed. They were now water and wind
based. She was learning how to control their new powers. The demons would be
similar to what her parents controlled. Peppers great-great-great grandmother
had been an angel from  heaven that had escaped  heaven and returned to the
world of the living. The four horse men were tasked with hunting down  and returning
those that were of the blood tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffron hurried off to class. She hated being late and today was going to  be
one of those  days. The girl had decided she needed to set her alarm spell to
activate earlier. She didn't need as  much sleep as she use to. It  was
important  for her to focus on her studies. Though she lived in an orphanage
a large sum of her parents fortune was invested into the orphanage. No
expense was  spared for the school. It was the very best. The tutors were
highly trained Witches and Wizards who had spent their lives perfecting their
craft. Peppers tutors had spent their live at their home experimenting
never leaving or achieving anything. They just said they were only
interested in creating a true witch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper awoke with the sun shining into her eyes. The witch thought she
had left her bedroom window open. Brisk morning breeze brushed her face.
Opening one eye Pepper could see The Great Tree in the distance. The city of
Komonai. She remembered about the potion contest. Realising that she must have
fallen asleep. A winged duck landed on her bed. Pepper looked at it in wonder
"QUACK", the duck asked Pepper. "You are too kind, but I have a potions
event to attend", pepper replies to the duck. "Another time?", smiles
Pepper. The duck fly's off disappointed. Pepper realised that she was being
carried to the potions event with her broomstick lifting he bed with Pepper
and Carrot inside. Pepper thanked Carrot for organising everything and getting
her to the potions event on time. The cat looked down from its perch on the
broom - giving Pepper a thumbs up. Peppers  witches  hat was too her right.#
Pepper  steered at it for a moment. The crinkle fabric  crinkling in the
wind, with the pointed top waving back and  forward. There was a fresh set
of clothes in her bag. Inside the bag was a potion filled with a yellow liquid.
It was not the thick green liquid she had created. Carrot must of packed the
wrong potion. Pepper was disappointed and annoyed with Carrot. There was no
way that the potion was going to work. She had lost already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper tried to hide her fear when she landed at the event. She stood proud
on her neatly made bed, wearing a fresh set of clothes. Her witches hat sat
on her head. Looking down she waved at the crowd who cheered her on. Her
bed and broom gently landed by the stage. Pepper leaped out with Carrot
springing side to side behind her. Three figures stood on the stage in
front of Pepper. On old grayhaired mustage, short and round man stood with
two young witches - they must of been the same age as Pepper. The dark
skinned witch had a afro, their witches hat
parting it to the side. Around her neck she
wore a necklace with two skulls. Under the
necklace she wore a red jacket and a white shirt
. A pair of goggles wrapped around the neck of her hat. She wore these when riding her
broom.
A fair haired witch stood on the other side.
She had Asian features but her skin was pale
white. Her top was loose hanging with large
open cuffs. Goldern writing patterns on a red
base. Underneath she wore a low cut white
shirt. In her  right hand she clutched a green
liquid filled glass bottle.
There was spose to be four witches completing
today. Pepper was glad she was not the
last to arrive. A purple tip of a hat appeared
in view of those on stage. All four on the
stage looked at the approaching figure.
Under the purple hat was shoulder height
straight blonde hair. Wide blue eyes steered
back. The witch flashed a white smile at the
contestants as she took her place.
Since all four witches had arrived the contest
ready to begin.  The Mayor introduced the
witches.
First was the dark skinned witch Coriander,
travelling from the Technologists Union for
the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The witch that had arrived at the event last was next to be announced.
Saffron. She posed for the crowd. Cheers erupted from the crowd.
Saffron believed because it was a home crowd she would have an
advantage on winning. A large sum on gold was part of the prize, along
with scholarships and internships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contestants were to demo their potion their potions in the order they
were introduced. Pepper was grateful of this. Perhaps she will have a chance
after all.
The potions had to be used on a test subject. Today's potion contest test subject
was a yellow bird. Coriander was the first witch to demo their potion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pale white witch was next.  Her home is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper was the final witch to be introduced. She stood there with her arms
folded looking cross. She was still angry with Carrot and looked at her
cat in dicuist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot06.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot05</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot05.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;one of the oldest tricks in the book too place. Death had slowed the Witch
down but she was still making a grab for her wand. He thought she had lost.
But for the second time that day Death was wrong. The Witch was able to reach
for her wand and yell off several words that Death didn't understand.
This caused him to be become stunned. The slowing spell Death had cast on the
witch was reserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye continued to follow Pepper under the ocean. The young witch had summoned
three of her demons that she commanded to attach the practice dummy.
Her Demons had morphed since Pepper had learnt these new sets of summon
spells. No longer were they land based Demons who liked cupcakes and drinking
tea, they were water and wind warrior elements.
The three Demons themselves were proud of their new powers. They were better
equipped to defend Pepper - like they had defended her parents and
grandparents before. In the end they had failed their masters - both
Peppers grandparents and parents were killed under their protection. The three
Demons swore that the devastation would never happen again and have focused
on protecting Pepper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neighbour peeked out his lounge windows at the Witches house.
A tall dark figure swept across the Witches property. Beside the figure
was a small Witch. She had a concerned expression. The neighbour knew something
was wrong. The older Witches were not home. He had seen the Three leave the
house on their brooms in the early morning.
He had to do something. Contact somebody. Stop this figure.
His best hope was to take his flying car and find the Witches. They would
go gone to the markets in Korama.
Using the old rusted blue car he was able to travel to the City to warn the
Three Witches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Witches had just finished their  shopping and  flying past the branches
of The Great Tree. In the distance  ahead of them a madman  was driving a
blue flying car towards then. The Witches  dashed out the way as the car
came near, slamming on the breaks. The vehicle slowed down, the man inside
yelling and waving, one arm clutching the steering wheel.The Witches look
around in wonder. The driver was clearly trying to communicate with them.
A man opened the door of the halted vechile, it was floating there with three Witches
at a cautions distance observing. He yelled about something happened at their
home and they needed to return. Created a summoning portal that teleported the
three witches to their home. They rushed inside the building to find Pepper.
They found the girl at her desk drawing up plans for her next spell. Nothing
was wrong. Beside her slept Carrot, the ginger coloured Cat.
A large smile appeared on Peppers face as she noticed her three godmothers
in the room. The shortest and oldest on the left. The leader of the group.
A skinny, tall, young spell tutor and an older plump rounded potions master.
The three had been training  the Pepper everything they knew about being a
Witch. Pepper was to become a true witch of chaos.  The three had promised
the girls parents and grandparents that they would train the girl.
The majority of children Peppers age became orphans due to the war between
two of the magic houses. Other houses were caught in the middle of the
convicts. Lands were destroyed and inhabits slaughtered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peppers new demons took on new forms. Instead of the texture of slime on their
bodies they had a water and transparent wind type forms. They were able to
switch back to their previous forms. One Demon was pure water based. Another
was pure wind based. The final was a mixture of the water and wind.
The water based demon was shaped like a mixture of dolphin and octopus.
Shaped like a dolphin for quick and efficient movement in the water. Long
octopus-like arms and legs coming off the body. When the demon was  on land
it used these octopus legs  to walk, it was certainly not faster than
travelling under the water, but it was OK.
The other side of the schools spells - wind. This demon was filled with fast
moving modules that caused the appearance of things to be blurred and mixed
up. Transparent at essence.
The final demon was a hybrid of the wind and water spells. The appearance was
a blurred effect with water being crashed around the figure. Waves hitting
the shoreline. Lightning cracks. Thunder booms.
Pepper had successfully summoned the three demons in their water and
wind forms. Her previous attempts were failures and the demons were twisted,
deformed, and powerless. She was excited for herself that this was a success.
She knew her parents would be proud of her. If they were still alive. She
had joined this house of magic as she wanted to take revenge for her
parents and houses peoples deaths.
Saffron was her largest threat. Pepper had recently discovered she was following
Pepper. The girl won't be able to follow her to the underwater city but she
was able to summon a eye that followed Pepper and  Carrot under the water
and  to the city. Pepper couldn't allow Saffron to discover where the city
was as she would unleash her army onto the city. Pepper instead  cast a spell
of her own that replaced the footage that the eye recorded with fake images,
leading the army into a trap and death.
He had told Pepper that judgement day was coming and she needed to train for it,
War was  near between some of the worlds most powerful Witches and creatures.
The water elements attacked the cities walls coming in  from the  north east
side  off the ocean. The city had attempted to setup boulders to stop  the
water and break  up  the flow. The  wind elements swept in and lifted these
obscures. The path was  clear for the water to crash upon the cities walls.
After the wind  elements had  cleared a path, the focused on attacking the
city walls in an attempt to collapse. The walls were tough and they stood
strong. The water elements changed tactics and the sky started to pour
with rain and hail above the city. Wind elements stopped attacking the city
walls and  started to lift up the ground - causing mud to spread over the city.
The mixture of mud and rain  caused people to move slow and become inaccurate
with their weapons.
The elements still needed to breach the city. Their defences were low. The
Water elements searched the city for an weak spots. They discovered a door
which had started to leak under the pressure of water and rain. The elements
were able to focus the door - causing a series of tidal waves to hit the door.
Wind elements assisted the water in creation of the tidal waves.
The door burst down after the third tidal wave hit it. Water smashed it's way over the guard building and towards the market square. The elements had
gained entry to the city.
The towns people were helpless when the waves came. They were knee deep in mud and unable to move.
The rain had stopped now that water was focused on tidal waves throughout the
city. A bright sun shone down - causing the mud to harden - trapping the
guards on the spot. They were able to fight the elements but were unable to
move and dodge the attacks. The elements were winning.
Under the ocean in the city an army of Witches controlled these elements -
commanding them to attack the city. They were after one thing - the seed of
flight. It is told that these seeds will grow a magical tree that has the
power of growth and flight - and spreads it to others. The Aquaq Witches wanted
the seed for themselves. Amongst the army of Witches was Peppers parents and
grandparents. Six witches. All commanding the attack on the city of Komora.
The city was in a panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot05.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
