Death had slowed the Witch
down but she was still making a grab for her wand. He thought she had lost.
But for the second time that day Death was wrong. The Witch was able to reach
for her wand and yell off several words that Death didn't understand.
This caused him to be become stunned. The slowing spell Death had cast on the
witch was reserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye continued to follow Pepper under the ocean. The young witch had summoned
three of her demons that she commanded to attach the practice dummy.
Her Demons had morphed since Pepper had learnt these new sets of summon
spells. No longer were they land based Demons who liked cupcakes and drinking
tea, they were water and wind warrior elements.
The three Demons themselves were proud of their new powers. They were better
equipped to defend Pepper - like they had defended her parents and
grandparents before. In the end they had failed their masters - both
Peppers grandparents and parents were killed under their protection. The three
Demons swore that the devastation would never happen again and have focused
on protecting Pepper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neighbour peeked out his lounge windows at the Witches house.
A tall dark figure swept across the Witches property. Beside the figure
was a small Witch. She had a concerned expression. The neighbour knew something
was wrong. The older Witches were not home. He had seen the Three leave the
house on their brooms in the early morning.
He had to do something. Contact somebody. Stop this figure.
His best hope was to take his flying car and find the Witches. They would
go gone to the markets in Korama.
Using the old rusted blue car he was able to travel to the City to warn the
Three Witches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Witches had just finished their  shopping and  flying past the branches
of The Great Tree. In the distance  ahead of them a madman  was driving a
blue flying car towards then. The Witches  dashed out the way as the car
came near, slamming on the breaks. The vehicle slowed down, the man inside
yelling and waving, one arm clutching the steering wheel.The Witches look
around in wonder. The driver was clearly trying to communicate with them.
A man opened the door of the halted vechile, it was floating there with three Witches
at a cautions distance observing. He yelled about something happened at their
home and they needed to return. Created a summoning portal that teleported the
three witches to their home. They rushed inside the building to find Pepper.
They found the girl at her desk drawing up plans for her next spell. Nothing
was wrong. Beside her slept Carrot, the ginger coloured Cat.
A large smile appeared on Peppers face as she noticed her three godmothers
in the room. The shortest and oldest on the left. The leader of the group.
A skinny, tall, young spell tutor and an older plump rounded potions master.
The three had been training  the Pepper everything they knew about being a
Witch. Pepper was to become a true witch of chaos.  The three had promised
the girls parents and grandparents that they would train the girl.
The majority of children Peppers age became orphans due to the war between
two of the magic houses. Other houses were caught in the middle of the
convicts. Lands were destroyed and inhabits slaughtered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peppers new demons took on new forms. Instead of the texture of slime on their
bodies they had a water and transparent wind type forms. They were able to
switch back to their previous forms. One Demon was pure water based. Another
was pure wind based. The final was a mixture of the water and wind.
The water based demon was shaped like a mixture of dolphin and octopus.
Shaped like a dolphin for quick and efficient movement in the water. Long
octopus-like arms and legs coming off the body. When the demon was  on land
it used these octopus legs  to walk, it was certainly not faster than
travelling under the water, but it was OK.
The other side of the schools spells - wind. This demon was filled with fast
moving modules that caused the appearance of things to be blurred and mixed
up. Transparent at essence.
The final demon was a hybrid of the wind and water spells. The appearance was
a blurred effect with water being crashed around the figure. Waves hitting
the shoreline. Lightning cracks. Thunder booms.
Pepper had successfully summoned the three demons in their water and
wind forms. Her previous attempts were failures and the demons were twisted,
deformed, and powerless. She was excited for herself that this was a success.
She knew her parents would be proud of her. If they were still alive. She
had joined this house of magic as she wanted to take revenge for her
parents and houses peoples deaths.
Saffron was her largest threat. Pepper had recently discovered she was following
Pepper. The girl won't be able to follow her to the underwater city but she
was able to summon a eye that followed Pepper and  Carrot under the water
and  to the city. Pepper couldn't allow Saffron to discover where the city
was as she would unleash her army onto the city. Pepper instead  cast a spell
of her own that replaced the footage that the eye recorded with fake images,
leading the army into a trap and death.
He had told Pepper that judgement day was coming and she needed to train for it,
War was  near between some of the worlds most powerful Witches and creatures.
The water elements attacked the cities walls coming in  from the  north east
side  off the ocean. The city had attempted to setup boulders to stop  the
water and break  up  the flow. The  wind elements swept in and lifted these
obscures. The path was  clear for the water to crash upon the cities walls.
After the wind  elements had  cleared a path, the focused on attacking the
city walls in an attempt to collapse. The walls were tough and they stood
strong. The water elements changed tactics and the sky started to pour
with rain and hail above the city. Wind elements stopped attacking the city
walls and  started to lift up the ground - causing mud to spread over the city.
The mixture of mud and rain  caused people to move slow and become inaccurate
with their weapons.
The elements still needed to breach the city. Their defences were low. The
Water elements searched the city for an weak spots. They discovered a door
which had started to leak under the pressure of water and rain. The elements
were able to focus the door - causing a series of tidal waves to hit the door.
Wind elements assisted the water in creation of the tidal waves.
The door burst down after the third tidal wave hit it. Water smashed it's way over the guard building and towards the market square. The elements had
gained entry to the city.
The towns people were helpless when the waves came. They were knee deep in mud and unable to move.
The rain had stopped now that water was focused on tidal waves throughout the
city. A bright sun shone down - causing the mud to harden - trapping the
guards on the spot. They were able to fight the elements but were unable to
move and dodge the attacks. The elements were winning.
Under the ocean in the city an army of Witches controlled these elements -
commanding them to attack the city. They were after one thing - the seed of
flight. It is told that these seeds will grow a magical tree that has the
power of growth and flight - and spreads it to others. The Aquaq Witches wanted
the seed for themselves. Amongst the army of Witches was Peppers parents and
grandparents. Six witches. All commanding the attack on the city of Komora.
The city was in a panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot05.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot04</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot04.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pepper sat on her bed and steered out the window. Her hands on knees.
Carrot looked up. She knows Pepper is upset about her birthday.
Carrot jumps up  on the bed and trys to comfite Pepper.
"It's nearly my birthday and I don't have any friends to celebrate
it with..", Pepper cries. Her head lowers and she bursts into tears.
Hands cover her face. Carrot strokes Peppers shoulder, it does no use.
An idea springs into Carrots head. She springs across to the table.
Carrots claw points at a framed photograph.
"Oh, invite the other witches we met at the Poition Contest?", Pepper
congrats Carrot. A smile apeared on Peppers face. Carrot is pleased with herself.
Pepper and Carrot work together and write invitations with Peppers feather pen.
The two remember back to the day of the potion contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As Mayor of Komona I declear the potion content... Open!",
The mans arms stretched out in excitment. In his right hand he grasped a rolled
scroll. The bag of gold behind him sparked in the sunlight. The four Witchs glearing
at the prize and each other. The winner would get a large prize.
"Our town is delighted to welcome no fewer than four witches for this first
edition", the major continued. He turned and faced the four witches,
"Please give a HUGE round of applause". The crowd burst with noise. A mixture of
nonmagical and magical beings were present in the crowd. Every house of magic was
present. This was one of the key events that lead to Hereva to be destoried. Death
had succecced finally. Pepper faced Death several times. She set traps for him and
hunted him down. For once it wasn't Death that did the hunting. Pepper could feel
icey breath on the back of his shoulder. She knew he was present. Twisting her head
she looked back. Nothing. The bottom of The Great Tree was visible. It's bark
obsorbing the healthy rays of the sun. Tinkle of silver made Pepper focus again.
Coriander was introduced first by the speaker, "All the way from the great
Technologist's Union, it's an honor to welcome the ravishing and ingenious
CORIANDER!". Posing with her chicken in her right arm and holding an orange
potion with her left arm.
Pepper had traveled back to that moment several times in an attempt to change
the future. It was no use, each time she changed events it got worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker continues to introduce the witches,
"not to forget our local girl, Komona's very own witch SAFFRON!". Tilting her head to the
right Saffron smiled holding her right hand on her hip and in the left arm holding the
potion, filled with a yellow bubbly liquid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"... Our third participant come to us from the lands of setting moons, SHICHIMI!",
The foxs tail was wrapped around the back of Shichimis neck and the fox perched on
the witches left arm. In her other hand she grasped a potion that was green and
had no bubble.
".. and finally, our last participant from the forest of Squirels End, Pepper!",
Standing with a sour and disapointed look on her face. Carrot held up Peppers
potions. It was a pale yellow colour. Death approved of the colour but would rather
a pale green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with time travel is it's easy to get lost and create too many
characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Demons of Chaosah Hornük, Eyeük and Spidük had morphed into their
Wharrgarblah alternative they were much the same - except water and
wind based. Hornük's green fur had grown in length. For the past week
they had been summoned daily into Hereva. The Four Horse Man had been
unleased on the world and the Demons had been summoned to stop them.
Famine had caused the crops in Hereva to die - starting with Squirrel's
End. The 2,000 villagers that lived there - the majority of them Farmers
and poor lost everything. War causd a war between
magic houses. Citizens of Hereva became ill because of the rider
Pestilence. Disease spread. Death was present at Komona when the package
was being transfered. "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A package was being transfered from Squirrel's
end to Komona. The contents would stop the war. Both  Magmah and Aquah
wanted to get their hands on it. The interception happened when the
package was traveling through the park in centre Komona. Aquah forces had
breached the city. The majority of the attack came from the skys.
Saffron's grandparents forght for Magmah and Peppers for Aquah.
The cities walls were destoried by the attack. A large Aquah army
moved through the crumbling walls. The Magmah army retreaded.
The magic school of Ah had discovered the seeds. An eldely witch
that lived in Squirrels Edge had created them. When Magmah and
Aquah had discovered the two armies launched attacks on the farmland
in search for the package. It only contained three seeds. When the Ah
transporer was intercepted in Komona one of the seeds was dropping -
causing The Great Tree to grow - lifting the city of Komona into the
sky. The polin of the tree spread to other areas of Hereva. In Squirrels
Edge the creatures are morphed and plants trees grow with magical powers.
The quality of the food improves dramatically. The crops grow easily.
The Great Tree stops the war. The armies lay down their arms go home.
The House of Ah force Magmah and Aquah to change their names to Kielbasah
and Wharrgarblah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only four dudes so hardcore they can wipe out all sentient life on Hereva.
Portal opened to Hereva and they entered and attempted to wipe out a fourth of the
world each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burger King crown sat upon the statues head. His mouth opening revealing a
nice set of white teeth. The brown beard was well groomed and his hair
curled. "Where is your God now"?, the Statue spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War had been around for centuies and despite Henevas best effects, some of them are
still alive. In his right arm he welded a white staff. It was bluetooth connected.
At the top of the staff was a monitor display. Feeds were sent over and procied
by War. Approval or Denial was given. His job was mostly automated now. After he
was defeated by The Great Tree he lived a relaxed life. Staying in the city of
Komona he stayed hidden by hiding in plain daylight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Mama were all going to die"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"WHO ELSE WERE YOU EXPECTING?", Death whispered into the slowed Witches ear.
Her fingers almost touched her wand. Bursting into laughter Death clapped his
hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Let the games begin!", a voice boomed over the statium. "The vote will be by
applaud-o-meter". First up Coriander's demostration. The dark skinned Witch stood
forward. Holding in left right hand was a dead bird. It's feathers pale. The Bird
had meet with Death already. "Ladies and Gentlemen", Coriander greeted the crowd.
"Fear death no more, thanks to my...", she poured the liquid from her potion onto
the dead animal. "Potion of ZOMBIFICATION!", she yelled towards the crowd. The crowd
clapped as the dead animal rose from the dead and marched forward. Death had failed and
felt very disapointed. Among the crowd Death steered at the girl and the
bright smile on her face, so pleased with herself that she was able to cheat him.
"FANTASTIC! Coriander defies death itself with this mi-ra-cu-lous potion!"
Because they were mocking him Death felt more angry.
Coriander bowed and the applause grew louder. Saffron intrupted the moment,
"But please.. save your applause, people of Komana". The crowd was silent.
"beacause here is MY potion", Saffron announced holding her poition obove her
head. "The real potion you've all been waiting for: the one which will amaze
your neighbors...", the young witch had captavated the crowd. "...make them
jealous!", Saffrpn poured her potion onto the zombie bird. "... all this is possible
with the simple application of a single drop of my ...", a drip of the potion
touched the feathers of the bird.
"POTION OF POSHNESS", Saffron screamed. The bird grew in size. It gained a curly
hairdo and dark gray coloured sunglasses. A brown pokerdot handbag apeared
under it's right wing.  The crowd burst into applause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: ERROR/3 (&lt;tt class="docutils"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, line 128)&lt;/p&gt;
Unexpected indentation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Fantastic! Incredible! This potion could make all of Komana rich!". Saffron steered
at Coriander with a smerk on her face. Coriander looked back and frowned.
"Your applause can't be wrong. Coriander has already been eliminated", a smile
flashed accross Saffrons face. Deeper into the abyss Coriander fell. She had been
defeated. The voice moved on to the third witch, "That last demostration would now
seem difficult to beat for Shichimi".&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot04.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot03</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot03.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did the war between Magmah and Aquah begin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houses accused each other of stealing one others spell
Aquah unleashed an attack on Magmah. The two houses decided that the winner of
the war would decide the name of the other house and release all their spell
secrets. Of course like any war there was no winner and in the end on the break
of both houses collapsing the High Council of Ah decided that both houses lost
and renamed both houses. A peace treaty between the two houses was signed but
rivery was still tense between the houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magical land of Hereva was born from the magical forces known as 'Chaos and
Evolutions'. Hereva formed when the magic elements of the cosmos evolved from the
chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trainer was waiting for Pepper at the magical underwater city.
She had planned the week out of spells that she would be teaching Pepper. The woman
tapped her feet as she waited for Pepper. She had no patience for lateness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coriander's fiftieth birthday was approaching and she had given a long list
of requests to her Father. She wanted to have the best birthday in Hereva and would
be highly disappointed if he didn't attend to all her requests. Her Father was meeting
with King Acren today. He had been pressuring the city of Komona to implement the tax
system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffron steered out her bedroom window to the city of Kormana below. She lived high
above the city in a tall castle. Saffron liked to live up so high, it gave her power
above all those below her. The city itself was already floating Hereva. Her castle
was owned by the King, but one day when he died she would inherit all his worth. She
prayed that he wouldn't die anytime soon though, life was good with him around.
Only the rich and upper-class lived in Komona, the poor and peasants lived below on
Hereva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffron sighed as she brushed her long blonde hair. Looking into the mirror her
large blue eyes stared back. She was perfect. Sitting on the dressing table
was her purple witches hat. She reached for it and place it upon her head. It matched
her suit. It was important she looked good. She wanted to be the best
witch so headed out the door to her classes. She knew the only way she was going to
be the best was attend classes. Saffron headed down the hallway, past the other
children rooms. They would still be sleeping, all orphans like herself but lazy
and unmotivated - unlike herself. Reaching the end of the hallway she headed down the
flight of steps. It wound around and around, past several stories of sleeping quarters.
Finally she reached the bottom where she was greeted by several orphanage working
preparing breakfast. She had no time for breakfast and waved them goodbye as she
unlocked the front door and headed out into the street. Saffron shrived in the brisk
cold morning. She wished she had another layer of clothes. Winter was approaching and
the tempture was changing. Saffron looked to her right. A group merchant were pushing
their cattle and cargo down the road towards the market. To Saffrons left was a bakery,
clothes store, potions shop, and the butcher. She headed towards the bakery. Outside
the bakery the smells were too good. The smell of fresh baking made Saffron regret
skipping out on breakfast. She skipped into the store. No one was behind the counter.
They must have been out the back. Saffron grabbed a cream bun and rushed back outside
before anyone spotted her. She walked down the road, eating the cream bun quite pleased
with herself. This was better than the breakfast her orphanage offered.
Now she needed to get to class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot03.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot02</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot02.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pepper continued with the recipe. Outside the lightning cracked and a rumble
of thunder could be heard. The dry ingredients were ground and added to a
boiling cauldron of wet ingredients - bats blood, lemon zest, vanilla essence,
and water. The brew bubbled as Pepper danced around the cauldron chanting:
'Witches Brew, Blind Bat, Sour Rabid,  Rise Cut, Cauldron Boil and cut this
grass'. Pepper repeated this chant three times before there was a loud band
and was blown back. 'Did I over do the ingredients', she thought - picking
herself up from the ground she approached the cauldron. The previous red mixture
had changed to a pale green colour. 'It worked!', Pepper yelled giving
Carrot a high five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the potion was complete Pepper needed a test subject. The recipe
recommended kidnapping an unsuspecting human but Pepper felt that was not
very nice. Instead she decided to test it on Carrot. Her cat could cut the
lawns if the potion worked. Pepper poured the thick green mixture into
Carrots water bowl. Carrot proceeded to lap the potion from it's bowl.
Peppere observed Carrot as the potions effects started to kick in. The cats
teeth grew and changed. They turned from short white like to a large metal like
and started to vibrate. The potion was working. Outside the lightning and thunder
had stopped and the weather had cleared up. The grass was dry and sun shining.
Pepper brought Carrot outside and watched as the cat began to cut the lawns.
It was working successfully. Pepper needed to cast a spell on Carrot in order
to stop from vomiting up the grass being ingested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumin, Cayenne and Thyme could see their home in the distance as they flew
their brooms. The three were returning from a day trip to Qualicity.
"What is Pepper up to?", Cayenne asked as they approach the house. Cumin
squinted the Pepper and Carrot, the two up to something in the front of the
house.
"I'm not sure", Cumin replied, "but whatever it is I will find out". The
three witches landed at the house. Cayenne and Thyme went inside the house
carrying the shopping that they had got from Qualicity.
"You're home!', Pepper yelled excited to see Cumin standing over her.
"I guess you are wondering what we are up to?", Pepper added.
Cumin nodded, with a strange expression on her face. Pepper explained how she
created the potion and used it on Carrot and that Carrot was successfully
cutting the grass. Cumin was confused to why the grass needed cut. She had
lived in this house for years and had never cut it in the past. Pepper
explained about meeting the neighbour and wanting to do something to be more
normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kielbasash vs Wharrgarblah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magmah vs Aquah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two schools are on the verge of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house of Kielbasah is focused on cooking, baking, grilling, boiling, frying,
steaming and toasting. It is the house of alchemy and rare metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wharrgarblah is the house of water, wind, clouds and the abyss. Those that are
members live deep under the ocean and rarely interact with those on land. They
believe they are super compared to those on the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper swollen the underwater breathing potion and dived into the ocean. Carrot
followed closely behind. She had been receiving guest training from the house
of Wharrgarblah. The house was cauctionst at first with the training but soon
after discovering Peppers talents of water spells - they welcomed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffron floated on her broom with her cat Komona and watched Pepper dive into
the water. She had been following her for several weeks - with the suspension
that Pepper had became involved with the house Wharrgarblah or Aquah as Saffron
believed the house should be refereed as. Saffron despised the house. Because of
them she was an orphan. He parents were killed in the war between the two
houses. Saffron would do anything in her power to bring down the house and she
felt betrayed by Pepper for being involved with the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Pepper swam she looked behind her and saw Carrot following close behind.
She had cast a spell on him that allowed him to enter the water without
getting wet - an air bubble. This allowed him to breath under water also.
This was just one of the spells Pepper had learnt from her new trainer at
the school of Wharrgarblah. She knew people would be suspicious of her
training with this school. She had learnt that her ancestors were part of the
house and that is why she was drawn into the house. Pepper wasn't worried. She
believed the houses should be kind and accepting to each other - sharing and
open.
Today Pepper was going to learn how to summon miniature bigfish. She had first
encountered BigFish when she was holidaying on an nearby island. Cumin had taught
her how to summon demons so she was able to pickup the spells for summoning
water spirits easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saffron had attempted to follow Pepper further. She hoovered above the water.
She was too frightened to enter the water herself, there could be traps or she
might end up drowning. Instead she had cast a spell that allowed to her send
an eye into the ocean to follow Pepper. She was able to stay above the water,
but view what the eye was seeing. They eye was following closely behind Pepper
and Carrot. Saffron hoped that the eye wouldn't be noticed - for her sake and
Peppers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peppers broom had transformed and developed organic fins and propellers to
allow her to travel quickly under the water. She was able to zip along quickly,
with Carrot perched on the front of the broom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot02.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>peppercarrot01</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot01.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;PepperCarrot. A Novel by William Mckee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She sat at her workbench. Twirling the feather pen in her
hand. A Cat slept peacefully beside her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mailman approached the mailbox with caution. Warning:
Witch Property, the box read. He had been watching the
house since these new witches had moved in. Several nights
ago as he was chopping onions he noticed from his window
green smoke drifting out  from the property. He had concerns
for what mischief they were up to.
What was worse is it wasn't just a single witch that had
moved in - it was a group of them. Three adult witches and a
child. He had seen the lot of them leave the house on their
broomsticks. He had thought about approaching the house and
having a peak through the window but he was worried that there
might be traps - or that the witches return and cast a spell
on him.
The girl had been friendly. He had seen her walking down the
road with her ginger cat. He had been mowing his lawns (something
they needed to do) when she walked past his house giving
him a wave and yelling "Hello Neighbour, I'm Pepper".
Pepper had a basket containing mushrooms. She offered some
mushrooms to the man but he refused. She tried to talk to him
further but he rushed back inside like he was afraid of her.
The man stomped up his front door steps, opened the door and headed
inside.
The door slammed behind him.
Peaking out the window he watches as Pepper is steering at the
house. He closes the curt-ins and continues to peak out.
Pepper calls out to her cat which is distracted playing
with a moth, "Come on Carrot, Let's finish our walk".
The two continue to walk down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house might need some maintenance Pepper thought. She
the mailbox and looked out to her home in the distance.
The garden had grown wild. An ancient oak tree wrapped its
way through the house. Pepper had asked her godmothers
about clearing it. They were shocked and refused explaining
that the oak tree was in fact alive and they wouldn't dare
chop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper had been given permission to mow the lawns. Maybe
if she maintained the house the neighbour wouldn't be
frightened of her anymore. She wasn't surprised when she
was told that they didn't own a lawnmower. 'Put your
training to use and use magic', Pepper was told. She spent
the morning looking through books for a spell that would
allow her to cut the grass. She found the perfect recipe.
The ingredients read: rose petals, cardamom, ginger, coriander,
hibiscus, red geranium, and powdered dragons tooth. All were
common herbs - except for the dragons tooth which was rare. Pepper
stepped out the back door and
headed towards the herb garden where the herbs grew. Reaching into
her pocket she pulled out a pair of secetares which she used to
cut the herbs. She hummed to herself as she works. The sky was turning
gray, a storm was coming. The Gods had predicted she was going to
make this spell. The first rain-dropped landed as Pepper finished
picking the herbs and took a step inside.
Pepper had picked the majority of ingredients she needed from the
garden. All she needed was the powdered dragons tooth. It was
in a glass container high in the shelf. Pepper climbed the ladder and
retrieved the glass container that contained the dragons tooth. She had
gone to a great deal to retrieve this - travelling around the world in
search of dragons and attempted to remove their teeth. In the end she
ended setting up a dragon dentist business and was overloaded with
toothache dragons that needed a tooth or two removed. Sadly she then
found out that the powdered dragons tooth didn't come from dragons but from
a plant. The Binomial name for Dragons Tooth was Lotus maritimus. It is part
of the genus Lotus. Pepper had to travel to South England for the plant. She
found it on a field in which cows were grazing. The plant had grown to a
height of 30cm.
The flowers were a pale yellow colour. The leaves in three's, 'clover'-like
but longer and terminating more suddenly at the far end.
Pepper learnt to make sure she knew what she was looking for before setting
out on future trips to retrieve ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper had planted the dragons teeth that she had removed from the dragons
in order to build an skeleton army. She would order this army to help out with
her duty's around the house. Pepper watered the patch of garden where she had
planted the teeth twice a day but no skeleton had risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/peppercarrot01.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2016 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
