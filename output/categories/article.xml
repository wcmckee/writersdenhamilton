It's being held in Auckland. Volunteering was the only option. Of course specifically - audio and
video. They called it in early to help setup with displays. It plans to be in a room where there are regular speakers. A room where it is focused on
quality talks - with slides. It has no idea about the video and audio setup they have. Perhaps in the morning check the internet for previous
conference videos. Even if it comes down to it - records audio on iphone. Hopefully place has decent mics and a camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time that it has attended this conference. It's a barcamp. un-conference. Create the sessions yourself. Given rooms, timeslots,
freedom to do what you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand - Ideas for a new website. How to find volunteers and allow them to micromanage. Champion volunteers within
volunteers. One of the great things about this conference is the people attending get to run the sessions. I would love to see one that explores
volunteers in small organizations and how they can scale and micromanage. Matt replied to my comment on a new ccanz site. I've suggested to move
away from php/wordpress and towards either a python powered framework or a static site - maybe a combo of both. See how this weekend plays out but
I'll be interested in a session to discuss and brainstorm ccanz site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be staying at Kirsty and Eriks on Thursday and Friday. It's my birthday on Friday. I've been asked to help setup at nzdevmob2015. I'm
looking forward to seeing the setup that they have. It should be quite good - they have been doing this for enough years. They are using Slack
for coms. It's the first time that I will use Slack but it seems very simple. It's like IRC but you have the option to pay for it, as well as it
seems more simple. I'm looking forward to all the free swag. It's been sometime since I've been to a Microsoft sponsored conference - global
game jam would of been the last one - and that was a game jam. Before that it might have been Hack Auckland - which was years ago now.
Other sponsors include TradeMe,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month I wrote a novel. It was called It Will Not Be Mine and was in the Science Fiction genre. The total wordcount was at 53,050 words. Each
section of the book is split into daily writing sections. There is no chapters or structure - just what I felt like writing that day. I've certainly
kept to a theme and worked on creating a story. I started to edit the novel towards the end of November. The 28th was the final day I wrote anything
of substance. On the 29th and 30th of November I wrote: 'hello' and 'world'. When editing I started with day1. It had a high word count for the first
day and allot of summery type writing, along with the ideas that others at NaNoWriMo meet up in Waikato had given me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meet ups in November in Hamilton were on every Wednesday morning. I got along to several of these. Sadly it was a bad time - 10am in the morning
so the majority of people were at school or work. I think if you are going to have meet ups during the week it's best to have them at a bar, bookstore,
or library. In Wellington they had weekly NaNoWriMo Wednesday meet ups at a bar. I didn't get a chance to attend one of these but talking to those
in Wellington they sounded popular.
Waikato also had a meet up on Saturdays. This was hosted by Lisa at her workplace. This was for only 2 hours. Like during the week not many people
showed up which was a disappointment. On each of the days of this event we only had three people in total in the weekends. The first weekend was
popular - 9 or so people. They found this in Wellington also - lots at the launch party but they drop off quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After writing for a whole month everyday i felt a bit empty and unknown what to do with myself. I had gained a habit of writing the novel everyday.
It was basically my life for a whole month. There was not much else that I did or was interested in. From when I woke up in the morning till getting
a boost on that days word count before I fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped editing the novel. I'm not even going to look at it till Jan 2016. Once Jan hits I'd like to edit it. There are plenty of spelling and
grammar errors that need fixed. It's currently a rough draft. Much of the novel I haven't even read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>article</category><category>conference</category><category>web</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nzdevmob2015.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>kiwipycon-travelbac</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/kiwipycon-travelbac.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;currently sitting at chch airport after spending the
weekend here for kiwiPyCon.
My experience started when I showed up at Catalyst IT on
Thursday and volunteered for AV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian was running the AV who I had previously worked with
at LCA2015. The setup for AV was much the same as at LCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of us were trained (or in my case - refereshed) for
AV. Toby (who primary did still photography), Jen (who
worked in track one on the camera), and Zane (who worked
with me in track 2). I had originally signed up to work on
track one but shifted around on the Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Friday I arrived at 8:30am and setup to record
the keynote. I was going to film it but Ryan suggested
that it would be a good idea to let someone who hadn't
filmed before have a go - so I let Jen on the camera.
I was switched to track two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived on time on Saturday to watch the keynote by
Katie Bell. I left partway thorough the keynote to setup
video in track two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recording of the first talk began after morning tea.
DVswitch was the software for recording - the ability to
live edit - switching between the camera and laptop with
keys 2 and 3 allows the videos to be uploaded to the
internet with minimal editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day was smooth with minimal problems. The most major
problem was at the beginning of a talk I was unable to
switch to the slides. The frame would just freeze on the
camera. I kept it on the camera and contacted Ryan.
DVswitch had to be reset and some settings changed to get
the laptop feed working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the final session on Saturday I was tired and needed a
break. Zane took over the camera - he needed a break from
the sound. I stayed for a bit to make sure Zane was fine
with camera duties, then headed outside for some fresh
air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday morning I slept in and awoke at 8am. I knew I
was going to miss some of the keynote but wasn't worried
as I wasn't filming it. I txted Ryan to let hime know that
I would be late and will arrive partway through the
keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took turns with Zane on the Sunday switching between
camera and sound. I also had the opitionity to mic
presenters which I hadn't done before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were less talks on the Sunday than Saturday so
wasn't so worn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the conference finished I walked from the university
to Hornby. It wasn't as bad walk as I was expecting,
taking an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I inspired to work on after attending KiwiPyCon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most inspiring talks for me was a lightning
talk given by a girl catrin who talked about CodeClub,
and Ministry Of Education.  I talked to her after the
lightning talks at afternoon tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>article</category><category>conference</category><category>python</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/kiwipycon-travelbac.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>kiwipycon2015</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/kiwipycon2015.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first KiwiPyCon I attended was back in 2013. The
location was the AUT campus in Centeral Auckland
This year it is in Christchurch. I have been typing
python code since 2011 so it took me 'several years
to discover the conference. In 2013 I was living in
Levin and took the night bus from Levin to Auckland
on Friday night. I arrived at KiwiPyCon early on
Saturday morning. I had paid for a student/unwaged
ticket. I didn't attend the dinner on Saturday
night. I had my dell laptop with me and can remember
typing python code with IPython Notebook. I didn't
attend KiwiPyCon last year in Wellington. Bit silly
of me really - but I did watch the talks on YouTube.
This year I applied for finacial assistence and they
were very generious - my ticket was paid for along
with $100.00 towards my travel. I am going to be
staying at a friends of a friends place in chch.
It's a caravan so unlikely to be anything special.
I'm not worried though - as long as I have a roof
over my head and a shower I will be fine. The
caravan is located at a park where there are showers
and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year is the first year that the conference is 3
full days. In the past its been just the Saturday
and Sunday. Though I believe in the past they have
had tuturials on the friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've taken a look at the talks. I need to decide on what
track to go to - 1 or 2.
Things I'll mostly be interested in hearing about:
Web Development. API, static blogs, design.
robotics. Raspberry Pi.
Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am less interested in database and cloud related topics.
Things like Openstack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning to work on Nikola on the Friday. In the
afternoon there are  beginner tuturials, and sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a call on the mailing list for people to give a
interest of any topics to sprint on.
There was mention of pip,
and my Nikola.
The creator of Nikola Roberia even expressed interest to
me on Twitter that he may be advable for hours/day if it
goes ahead.
I'd like to see it happen. I will be working on it and
encourage others to join me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what types of people I would get. Some
may be experts with static blogs. Others may never of
heard of them.
I'll be willing to help people in getting started with
Nikola, but the best thing to do is read the site and
use it before the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas for spring - Excel doc.
Lists all issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November there is the NaNoWrite. Write 50,000
word novel. 2014 was the first year I attempted this.
I'd like to write a self biologey. Or maybe a autobiography
on someone.
My best friend Peter could be interesting to write 50,000
words about.
It might be better to take his character and write it
into a fiction character&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently sitting in Auckland airport. I have my boarding
pass and just waiting to board. It's an overcast day, but
it's not raining suprisinly.
When I first arrived I had a panic attack and went through
the security without getting my boarding pass. As soon as
I was through security I relized my mistake and went back
to collect my boarding pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I am on flight to christchurch. The
takeoff was smooth and I have an excellent window
view of New Zealand. Just experienced a little
turtalence but it was minor. The flight is only
going to take an hour. We are above the clouds and
looking down all I can see is ocean and some
coastline. I was sitting at the wrong gate - I
thought it was gate 30, but
but turns out it was gate 21. I noticed when someone else
was asking about Jetstar and they were redirected.
I quickly packed my Pi up and headed to the correct gate.
I was one of the last thoough the gate but I wasn't late.
There is no free food or drink on this flight.
I have a bottle of water and two sandwhichs. They are in my
bag though which is in the overhead lockers. Once I land
in Chch I will put on warm clothes, eat my food.
I then need
The food and drink service has just closed - we have
almost arrived in chch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python related news the third and final keynote has
been announced - Alison ? who works for Dropbox.
This means that there is three female keynote speakers
at KiwiPyCon. This has to be a first.
It's great there is such a large number but I do hope they
are not keyspeakers just because they are female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie comes from a education background so the talk will
likely not be very techniqaual. Lets hope it's not wishy
washly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once they announce trays up I'm going to switch off the pi
and pack it into my laptop bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight is almost over. It was a smooth flight but my
stomach is a bit sore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mountains have snow on them. It is very mountionous.
This has to be the south island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly I left my camera at home. I guess it's one thing
I won't lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plane is almost completely full - I'm at the back row
(30) and there is no one in the five seats beside me. '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to shutdown. Till we arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;testing the pi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I went to CatalystIT and heled cutting volcous
items. First was&lt;/p&gt;

web/software/videogame developer, writer,
public speaker, photographer, videographer,
and educator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He volunteers for Creative Commons NZ
helping to promote Creative Commons.
Everything he creates
is licensed under a Creative Commons license,
with preference for the more liberal, and
open culture licenses - CC BY and CC BY-SA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His art can be found at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://artcontrol.me/"&gt;http://artcontrol.me/&lt;/a&gt; and is
available under a Creative Commons
Attribution (BY) license.
William is a supporter, user, and developer of
open source software and hardware. He is passionate
about early childhood education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2015 William successfully 'won' NaNoWriMo. The
novel he wrote one day at a time for the month titled
It Will Not Be Mine is a Science Fiction novel which
William has licensed under a CC BY license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Creative Commons is useful to an artist to promote
the work and it makes the world a better place," says
William. "Others may find new uses with my content
and even make money, good on them!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During High School William spent the majority
of his senior years in the Design room. Spending the majority of his time creating vector
designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William became interested in
drawing after leaving high school and
attending UCOL in Palmerston North.
There he had a drawing tutor, Mark,
who inspired him to keep a drawing journal.
William gained the habit of carrying a
sketchbook wherever
he goes, along with a pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William created the site artcontrol.me:
The Art Of William McKee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site was created for a home for William
to host his artwork and reflect upon it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally powered by WordPress, he has since
switched to the Python static website
generator - Nikola. This powers his various sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William was always interested in using
a Creative Commons license, he at first
chose to use a more restrictive
Attribution-Noncommercial (BY-NC) license
for his artworks, though soon chose to use
the liberal Attribution (BY) license.
William doesn't see many reasons for artists
to use NC licenses, and finds it especially
problematic when NC licensing is used by
governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As William argues, "Tax payers have already
paid for the material. It should therefore be licensed under the most liberal licenses
(perhaps even public domain/creative commons
zero). This allows the most freedom for
people to do what they like with the content."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of attribution. Everyone should be
licensing their copyright work under a Create Commons Attribution license or
zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William also point out that the
"Non-Commercial licenses are hard to
interpret, as was noted in a German court
case in 2014, which strongly limited the
interpretation of NC to 'personal use.'
Similar problems with the interpretation
of NC could exist in other countries.
This is why I think everyone should avoid
the NC license. I would actually prefer that
the NC license not exist in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing, Williams says, is that the
majority of New Zeal and government works
released under CC seems to be under CC BY,
though he is concerned that some schools
seem to have adopted an NC license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended
The Learning Connection, where he began to
focus on life drawing. This was created on
brown paper with an easel. Pencil, colored
pencil, oil pastel, acrylic paint, gouache,
watercolors were the media that he used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William had done digital painting since
attending UCOL with illustration classes.
He used a Wac on tablet. Currently for his
digital painting William uses an Into us 5
small tablet connected to a Raspberry Pi
computer. The software he uses is GIMP 2.8
and it is running the operating system
Rabin (Debian Jessie, Stable). William uses
a battery pack plugged into the Pi to power it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William uses the Pi to edit text. Plugging
in a keyboard and uses terminal with the
software to edit text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital later focused on portraits using GIMP, an free and open source
raster graphics software. William began by
painting on a windows desktop and laptop,
later switching to Fedora and Debian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He uses a Raspberry Pi 2b with a 480PX by 320PX touch screen and
Wacom tablet attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait
and figures were drawn from references on
RedditGetsDrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William would draw portraits of people and
give them the drawing - taking a photo for
his own reference. pencil and colored pencil
was the media used mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the page he would sign
with McKee artcontrol.me and write 'cc by'
on the piece of original artwork.
These were mostly completely in pencil
and colored pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William is also passionate about working
with children. In 2014 he volunteered at
Huang Early Learning Cent re,
where he would work collaboratively with
kids, often on the same piece of art,
using oil pastel, pencil, and colored
pencil.
He was influenced by the children artwork
- often redrawing elements of their works.
The children works were taken into digital
painting. With GIMP artwork is digital traced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William took the liberty of licensing these
works under a CC BY license - photographing
and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me.
He would create large chalk murals on the
ground outside, with children requested that
he draw comic book characters like the Hulk,
Spider man, Bane, and Batman. These mural
pieces were created on the fence line of
Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School.
Swarms of school children would crowd the
fence line - watching and discussing the
artwork with him. They were blown away
from how quickly he worked and the
quality of his artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A hope of mine," William says,
"was the children would learn that art was
about sharing and remixing - something
Creative Commons has at its core."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William has since become a volunteer for
Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand,
helping to spread the word about
Creative Commons licensing.

&lt;p&gt;BY MATT MCGREGOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing ideas for the 2016 OER Sprints.
To get involved, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join our organising group (on a platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;tt class="docutils"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, line 10)&lt;/p&gt;
Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;called Loomio)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill out the expression of interest form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out the existing task-list for the&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;tt class="docutils"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, line 15)&lt;/p&gt;
Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;events&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LETS SPRINT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organise the Open Educational Resource
Sprints 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are getting a critical mass of schools with Creative Commons policies, enabling teachers to legally share and
collaborate. This is good news, of course,
but the risk is that the policy becomes just
a piece of paper, to which no one really
pays all that much attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites/resources etc should be clearly state the work is under a Creative Common
licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show how kiwi teachers can work together to
make new, open resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's a sprint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An idea borrowed from the technology sector,
where it is sometimes called a hack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The GovHack' weekends are one example of technologists, designers and a range of
other volunteers coming together to make new
products and services from open government
data and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example that inspired us was the Media
Text Hack, a team of educators and
researchers got together to write an open
Media Studies textbook. It's now an assigned
undergraduate textbook at the University of
Otago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other example was the Oppikirjamaraton
(Finnish for - textbook marathon). This event
involved about thirty Finnish mathematics
educators writing a new textbook for schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These events give us working models of how
an OER Sprint might work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organising teams have been open about the
problems they had during the event and what
they would do differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At tech conferences sprinting is often used
an event where people work towards a goal -
often bugfixes in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DECISIONS, DECISIONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still details about the event to figure out.
Opened up the process early, everyone can
see how decisions are being made. In the end,
we will have a model that schools,
associations and informal groups of teachers
can use to sprint - or hack - their way to
the resources they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do we need to think about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be reflecting on these issues over the next few months - both here at
NZCommons and in our open Loomio group, with
other volunteer organisers. But here's a few
to get us started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long should it last for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sprints last for two days, others just
one. Some sprints keep strict,
family-friendly time-frames, while others
keep working deep into the night. We ought to keep it short and sweet i.e a busy
9/10-5 - for either one or two days, though
with an expectation than many participants
won't be able to commit for the full period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology the bane of many such events.
We'll need to find a technical platform that
works for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial thinking is that Google Docs
will work fine for small teams, and is a
technology many teachers already use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bigger projects with many more
collaborators  have had issues with using
Google Docs, and more technical platforms
like Github have also been problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants, volunteers and facilitators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be a two day event. Saturday and
Sunday are usually good. There is the idea
of opening the conference on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What skills do we need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the best mix of practising teachers, non-teaching subject-area experts
(like academics), facilitators and other
volunteers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the focus of the event as by
teachers, for teachers, with other volunteers
serving to support the needs of the
participants teachers. At the same time, we
want to take advantage of the collective
expertise of everyone who wants to help out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's a resource?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other sprints have focused on making single book (or book-like entity). My feeling
is that a resource is whatever the heck
participants decide to make on the day,
and that this should be the decision of each
individual team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team formation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what constitutes a team? How many people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3-6 seems about right, though I'm not sure
about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about virtual participation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we're working on Google docs, this is
fine though virtual collaboration
can breed those dreaded Technological
Problems, which well want to avoid. But we
shouldn't put any barriers
on people participating, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will the events actually look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will involve people sitting at tables,
talking and typing. Minimise
the amount of scene-setting at the
beginning, and look to have a plethora of
helpers to solve problems as they arise.
This will involve giving clear guidance
beforehand. A minor amount of faffing about
at the beginning is probably unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much does it cost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our point of view, there are two sorts
of costs: event costs; and outreach costs,
before and after the event. For the event,
we'll need funding or in-kind sponsorship
to cover food, drink, venue, technology and
other incidental costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the outreach, we'll need funding to get
resources on CC and OER to as many teachers
as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, how many events?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were not sure, yet, though before the end
of the year, we should make some initial
committments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keen to have them anywhere and everywhere,
though this will depend on us getting strong
local support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BY MATT MCGREGOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post introduces some ideas for the 2016 OER Sprints. If you want to get involved, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;join our organising group (on a platform called Loomio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LETS SPRINT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, we announced our plans to organise the Great 2016 Open Educational Resource Sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said in my post last week, were getting a critical mass of schools with Creative Commons policies,
which are enabling teachers to legally share and collaborate. This is good news, of course, but the
risk is that the policy becomes just a piece of paper, to which no one really pays all that much attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's our opinion at CCANZ that its about time we put these policies into practice, and show how kiwi teachers
can work together to make new, open resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, the Sprints. But when you announce a new idea like an OER Sprint, you quickly find people asking a few quite important questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT'S A SPRINT, ANYWAY?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets begin with the first one. What's a sprint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resource sprint is an idea borrowed from the technology sector, where it is sometimes called a hack
'The GovHack' weekends are one example of technologists, designers and a range of other volunteers
coming together to make new products and services from open government data and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the education sector, one of the big examples that inspired us was the Media Text Hack (theres that word again),
where a team of educators and researchers got together to write an open Media Studies textbook. It's now an assigned
undergraduate textbook at the University of Otago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other example - which itself inspired the Media Text Hack team - was the Oppikirjamaraton (that's Finnish for - textbook marathon).
This event involved about thirty Finnish mathematics educators writing a new textbook for schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these events give us working models of how an OER Sprint might work.
Both organising teams have also been open about the problems they had during the event (such as technology -surprise, surprise)
and what they would do differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DECISIONS, DECISIONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these fantastic examples, there's still a heap of details about the event that we need to figure out. We've decided to open
up the process early, so everyone can see how our decisions are being made. Hopefully, at the end, we have a model that schools,
associations and informal groups of teachers can use to sprint - or hack - their way to the resources they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do we need to think about? I'll be reflecting on these issues over the next few months - both here at NZCommons and in our
open Loomio group, with other volunteer organisers. But here's a few to get us started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long should it last for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What skills do we need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And whatâs the best mix of practising teachers, non-teaching subject-area experts (like academics), facilitators
and other volunteers? My feeling is that we need to keep the focus of the event as âby teachers, for teachers,
with other volunteers serving to support the needs of the participants teachers. At the same time, we want to take

I'm obviously keen to have them anywhere and everywhere, though this will depend on us getting strong local support.&lt;/p&gt;
