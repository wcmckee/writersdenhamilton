weekend here for kiwiPyCon.
My experience started when I showed up at Catalyst IT on
Thursday and volunteered for AV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian was running the AV who I had previously worked with
at LCA2015. The setup for AV was much the same as at LCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of us were trained (or in my case - refereshed) for
AV. Toby (who primary did still photography), Jen (who
worked in track one on the camera), and Zane (who worked
with me in track 2). I had originally signed up to work on
track one but shifted around on the Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Friday I arrived at 8:30am and setup to record
the keynote. I was going to film it but Ryan suggested
that it would be a good idea to let someone who hadn't
filmed before have a go - so I let Jen on the camera.
I was switched to track two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived on time on Saturday to watch the keynote by
Katie Bell. I left partway thorough the keynote to setup
video in track two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recording of the first talk began after morning tea.
DVswitch was the software for recording - the ability to
live edit - switching between the camera and laptop with
keys 2 and 3 allows the videos to be uploaded to the
internet with minimal editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day was smooth with minimal problems. The most major
problem was at the beginning of a talk I was unable to
switch to the slides. The frame would just freeze on the
camera. I kept it on the camera and contacted Ryan.
DVswitch had to be reset and some settings changed to get
the laptop feed working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the final session on Saturday I was tired and needed a
break. Zane took over the camera - he needed a break from
the sound. I stayed for a bit to make sure Zane was fine
with camera duties, then headed outside for some fresh
air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday morning I slept in and awoke at 8am. I knew I
was going to miss some of the keynote but wasn't worried
as I wasn't filming it. I txted Ryan to let hime know that
I would be late and will arrive partway through the
keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took turns with Zane on the Sunday switching between
camera and sound. I also had the opitionity to mic
presenters which I hadn't done before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were less talks on the Sunday than Saturday so
wasn't so worn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the conference finished I walked from the university
to Hornby. It wasn't as bad walk as I was expecting,
taking an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I inspired to work on after attending KiwiPyCon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most inspiring talks for me was a lightning
talk given by a girl catrin who talked about CodeClub,
and Ministry Of Education.  I talked to her after the
lightning talks at afternoon tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>article</category><category>conference</category><category>python</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/kiwipycon-travelbac.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>william-mckee-on-cc-remix</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/william-mckee-on-cc-remix.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Mckee is an artist,
web/software/videogame developer, writer,
public speaker, photographer, videographer,
and educater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He volunteers for Creative Commons NZ
helping to promote Creative Commons in
the Hamilton area and through organisions
he is involved with - artcontrol, Writers
Den Hamilton, Hamilton Computer Club,
Hamilton Library. Everything he creates
is licenced under a Creative Commons license,
with preference for the more libral, and
open culture licences - CC BY and CC BY-SA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His art can be found at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://artcontrol.me/"&gt;http://artcontrol.me/&lt;/a&gt; and is
available under a Creative Commons
Attribution (BY) licence.
William is a supporter, user, and developer of
open source software and hardware. He is passionate
about early childhood education having volunteered for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Creative Commons is useful to an artist to promote
the work and it makes the world a better place," says
William. "Others may find uses for my art
and even make money from it, good on them!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During High School William spent the majority
of his senior years in the Design room. Spenting the majority of his time creating vector
designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William became interested in
drawing after leaving high school and
attending UCOL in Palmerston North.
There he had a drawing tutor, Mark,
who inspired him to keep a drawing journal.
William gained the habit of carrying a
sketchbook wherever
he goes, along with a pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William created the site artcontrol.me:
The Art Of William Mckee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site was created for a home for William
to host his artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally powered by WordPress, he has since
switched to the Python static website
generator - Nikola. This powers his various sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hosted with GoDaddy and ran CentOS. The site was powered by WordPress,
switching later to Nikola.
He later also switched this to DigitalOcean
with the operating system Debian, which is
used by the majority of his machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well William was always interested in using
a Creative Commons licence, he at first
chose to use a more restrictive
Attribution-NonCommercial (BY-NC) licence
for his artworks, though soon chose to use
the liberal Attribution (BY) licence.
William doesn't see many reasons for artists
to use NC licences, and finds it especially
problematic when NC licensing is used by
governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As William argues, "Tax payers have already
paid for the material. It should therefore be licensed under the most liberal licences
(perhaps even public domain/creativecommons
zero). This allows the most freedom for
people to do what they like with the content."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of aribution. Everyone should be
licencing their copyright work under a Create Commons Attribution licence or
zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William also point out that the
"Non-Commercial licences are hard to
interpret, as was noted in a German court
case in 2014, which strongly limited the
interpretation of NC to 'personal use.'
Similar problems with the interpretation
of NC could exist in other countries.
This is why I think everyone should avoid
the NC licence. I would actually prefer that
the NC licence not exist in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing, Williams says, is that the
majority of New Zealand government works
released under CC seems to be under CC BY,
though he is concerned that some schools
seem to have adopted an NC licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended
The Learning Connexion, where he began to
focus on life drawing. This was created on
brown paper with an easel. Pencil, coloured
pencil, oil pastel, acrylic paint, gouche,
watercolours were the media that he used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William had done digital painting since
attending UCOL with illustration classes.
He used a Wacon tablet. Currently for his
digital painting William uses an Intous 5
small tablet connected to a Raspberry Pi
computer. The software he uses is GIMP 2.8
and it is running the operating system
Rasbian (Debian Jessie, Stable). William uses
a batery pack plugged into the Pi to power it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William uses the Pi to edit text. Plugging
in a keyboard and uses terminal with the
softwarenano to edit text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digial later focused on portraits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;using GIMP, an free and open source
raster graphics software. William began by
painting on a windows desktop and laptop,
later switching to Fedora and Debian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait
and figures were drawn from references on
RedditGetsDrawn. During this period,
William would draw portraits of people and
give them the drawing - taking a photo for
his own reference.
At the bottom of the page he would sign
with wcmckee artcontrol.me and write 'cc by'
on the piece of original artwork.
These were mostly completely in pencil
and coloured pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William is also passionate about working
with children. In 2014 he volunteered at
Whaihanga Early Learning Centre,
where he would work collaboratively with
kids, often on the same piece of art,
using oil pastel, pencil, and coloured
pencil.
He was influenced by the children's artwork
- often redrawing elements of their works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William took the liberty of licensing these
works under a CC BY licence - photographing
and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me.
He would create large chalk murals on the
ground outside, with children requested that
he draw comic book characters like the Hulk,
Spiderman, Bane, and Batman. These mural
pieces were created on the fenceline of
Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School.
Swarms of school children would crowd the
fenceline - watching and discussing the
artwork with him. They were blown away
from how quickly he worked and the
quality of his artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A hope of mine," William says,
"was the children would learn that art was
about sharing and remixing - something
Creative Commons has at its core."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William has since become a volunteer for
Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand,
helping to spread the word about
Creative Commons licensing in
the Hamilton region.
If you want to volunteer, get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BY MATT MCGREGOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post introduces some ideas for the 2016 OER Sprints. If you want to get involved, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;join our organising group (on a platform called Loomio)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fill out the expression of interest form&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;check out the existing task-list for the events&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LETS SPRINT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, we announced our plans to organise the Great 2016 Open Educational Resource Sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said in my post last week, were getting a critical mass of schools with Creative Commons policies,
which are enabling teachers to legally share and collaborate. This is good news, of course, but the
risk is that the policy becomes just a piece of paper, to which no one really pays all that much attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's our opinion at CCANZ that its about time we put these policies into practice, and show how kiwi teachers
can work together to make new, open resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, the Sprints. But when you announce a new idea like an OER Sprint, you quickly find people asking a few quite important questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT'S A SPRINT, ANYWAY?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets begin with the first one. What's a sprint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resource sprint is an idea borrowed from the technology sector, where it is sometimes called a hack
'The GovHack' weekends are one example of technologists, designers and a range of other volunteers
coming together to make new products and services from open government data and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the education sector, one of the big examples that inspired us was the Media Text Hack (theres that word again),
where a team of educators and researchers got together to write an open Media Studies textbook. It's now an assigned
undergraduate textbook at the University of Otago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other example - which itself inspired the Media Text Hack team - was the Oppikirjamaraton (that's Finnish for - textbook marathon).
This event involved about thirty Finnish mathematics educators writing a new textbook for schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these events give us working models of how an OER Sprint might work.
Both organising teams have also been open about the problems they had during the event (such as technology -surprise, surprise)
and what they would do differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DECISIONS, DECISIONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these fantastic examples, there's still a heap of details about the event that we need to figure out. We've decided to open
up the process early, so everyone can see how our decisions are being made. Hopefully, at the end, we have a model that schools,
associations and informal groups of teachers can use to sprint - or hack - their way to the resources they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do we need to think about? I'll be reflecting on these issues over the next few months - both here at NZCommons and in our
open Loomio group, with other volunteer organisers. But here's a few to get us started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long should it last for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sprints last for two days, others just one. Some sprints keep strict, family-friendly time-frames,
while others keep working deep into the night. My feeling is that we ought to keep it short and sweet i.e a busy 9/10-5 - for either
one or two days, though with an expectation than many participants won't be able to commit for the full period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology the bane of many such events. We'll need to find a technical platform that works for everyone.
My initial thinking is that Google Docs will work fine for small teams, and is a technology many teachers already use.
Some bigger projects with many more collaborators  have had issues with using Google Docs, and more technical platforms
like Github have also been problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants, volunteers and facilitators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What skills do we need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And whatâs the best mix of practising teachers, non-teaching subject-area experts (like academics), facilitators
and other volunteers? My feeling is that we need to keep the focus of the event as âby teachers, for teachers,
with other volunteers serving to support the needs of the participants teachers. At the same time, we want to take
advantage of the collective expertise of everyone who wants to help out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's a resource?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other sprints have focused on making single book (or book-like entity). My feeling is that a resource is whatever the
heck participants decide to make on the day, and that this should be the decision of each individual team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team formation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what constitutes a team? How many people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3-6 seems about right, though I'm not sure about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about virtual participation? If we're working on Google docs, this is fine though virtual collaboration
can breed those dreaded Technological Problems, which well want to avoid. But we shouldn't put any barriers
on people participating, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will the events actually look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My assumption is that it will involve people sitting at tables, talking and typing. We should try to minimise
the amount of scene-setting at the beginning, and look to have a plethora of helpers to solve problems as they arise.
This will involve giving clear guidance beforehand. A minor amount of faffing about at the beginning is probably unavoidable.
How much does it cost? From our point of view, there are two sorts of costs: event costs; and outreach costs, before and
after the event. For the event, we'll need funding or in-kind sponsorship to cover food, drink, venue, technology and
other incidental costs. For the outreach, we'll need funding to get resources on CC and OER to as many teachers as possible.
Finally, how many events? Weâre not sure, yet, though before the end of the year, we should make some initial committments.
I'm obviously keen to have them anywhere and everywhere, though this will depend on us getting strong local support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last plug: if you want to help answer these questions, join our Loomio!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>article</category><category>creativecommons</category><category>education</category><category>oed2016</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/edr-sprint.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2015 03:18:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>edr-sprint-william</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/edr-sprint-william.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;LET'S SPRINT: A NEW(ISH) MODEL TO MAKE OPEN

&lt;p&gt;Introducing ideas for the 2016 OER Sprints.
To get involved, you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LETS SPRINT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organise the Open Educational Resource
Sprints 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are getting a critical mass of schools with Creative Commons policies, enabling teachers to legally share and
collaborate. This is good news, of course,
but the risk is that the policy becomes just
a piece of paper, to which no one really
pays all that much attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites/resources etc should be clearly state the work is under a Creative Common
licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show how kiwi teachers can work together to
make new, open resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's a sprint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An idea borrowed from the technology sector,
where it is sometimes called a hack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The GovHack' weekends are one example of technologists, designers and a range of

&lt;p&gt;These events give us working models of how
an OER Sprint might work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organising teams have been open about the
problems they had during the event and what
they would do differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At tech conferences sprinting is often used
an event where people work towards a goal -
often bugfixes in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DECISIONS, DECISIONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still details about the event to figure out.
Opened up the process early, everyone can
see how decisions are being made. In the end,
we will have a model that schools,
associations and informal groups of teachers
can use to sprint - or hack - their way to
the resources they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do we need to think about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be reflecting on these issues over the next few months - both here at
NZCommons and in our open Loomio group, with
other volunteer organisers. But here's a few
to get us started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants, volunteers and facilitators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be a two day event. Saturday and
Sunday are usually good. There is the idea
of opening the conference on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What skills do we need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the best mix of practising teachers, non-teaching subject-area experts
(like academics), facilitators and other
volunteers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the focus of the event as by
teachers, for teachers, with other volunteers
serving to support the needs of the
participants teachers. At the same time, we
want to take advantage of the collective
expertise of everyone who wants to help out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's a resource?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other sprints have focused on making single book (or book-like entity). My feeling
is that a resource is whatever the heck
participants decide to make on the day,
and that this should be the decision of each
individual team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team formation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what constitutes a team? How many people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3-6 seems about right, though I'm not sure
about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about virtual participation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we're working on Google docs, this is
fine though virtual collaboration
can breed those dreaded Technological
Problems, which well want to avoid. But we
shouldn't put any barriers
on people participating, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will the events actually look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will involve people sitting at tables,
talking and typing. Minimise
the amount of scene-setting at the
beginning, and look to have a plethora of
helpers to solve problems as they arise.
This will involve giving clear guidance
beforehand. A minor amount of faffing about
at the beginning is probably unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much does it cost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our point of view, there are two sorts
of costs: event costs; and outreach costs,
before and after the event. For the event,
we'll need funding or in-kind sponsorship
to cover food, drink, venue, technology and
other incidental costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the outreach, we'll need funding to get
resources on CC and OER to as many teachers
as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, how many events?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were not sure, yet, though before the end
of the year, we should make some initial
committments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keen to have them anywhere and everywhere,
though this will depend on us getting strong
local support.&lt;/p&gt;
