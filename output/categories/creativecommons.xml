web/software/videogame developer, writer,
public speaker, photographer, videographer,
and educater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He volunteers for Creative Commons NZ
helping to promote Creative Commons in
the Hamilton area and through organisions
he is involved with - artcontrol, Writers
Den Hamilton, Hamilton Computer Club,
Hamilton Library. Everything he creates
is licenced under a Creative Commons license,
with preference for the more libral, and
open culture licences - CC BY and CC BY-SA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His art can be found at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://artcontrol.me/"&gt;http://artcontrol.me/&lt;/a&gt; and is
available under a Creative Commons
Attribution (BY) licence.
William is a supporter, user, and developer of
open source software and hardware. He is passionate
about early childhood education having volunteered for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Creative Commons is useful to an artist to promote
the work and it makes the world a better place," says
William. "Others may find uses for my art
and even make money from it, good on them!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During High School William spent the majority
of his senior years in the Design room. Spenting the majority of his time creating vector
designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William became interested in
drawing after leaving high school and
attending UCOL in Palmerston North.
There he had a drawing tutor, Mark,
who inspired him to keep a drawing journal.
William gained the habit of carrying a
sketchbook wherever
he goes, along with a pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William created the site artcontrol.me:
The Art Of William Mckee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site was created for a home for William
to host his artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally powered by WordPress, he has since
switched to the Python static website
generator - Nikola. This powers his various sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hosted with GoDaddy and ran CentOS. The site was powered by WordPress,
switching later to Nikola.
He later also switched this to DigitalOcean
with the operating system Debian, which is
used by the majority of his machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well William was always interested in using
a Creative Commons licence, he at first
chose to use a more restrictive
Attribution-NonCommercial (BY-NC) licence
for his artworks, though soon chose to use
the liberal Attribution (BY) licence.
William doesn't see many reasons for artists
to use NC licences, and finds it especially
problematic when NC licensing is used by
governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As William argues, "Tax payers have already
paid for the material. It should therefore be licensed under the most liberal licences
(perhaps even public domain/creativecommons
zero). This allows the most freedom for
people to do what they like with the content."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of aribution. Everyone should be
licencing their copyright work under a Create Commons Attribution licence or
zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William also point out that the
"Non-Commercial licences are hard to
interpret, as was noted in a German court
case in 2014, which strongly limited the
interpretation of NC to 'personal use.'
Similar problems with the interpretation
of NC could exist in other countries.
This is why I think everyone should avoid
the NC licence. I would actually prefer that
the NC licence not exist in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing, Williams says, is that the
majority of New Zealand government works
released under CC seems to be under CC BY,
though he is concerned that some schools
seem to have adopted an NC licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended
The Learning Connexion, where he began to
focus on life drawing. This was created on
brown paper with an easel. Pencil, coloured
pencil, oil pastel, acrylic paint, gouche,
watercolours were the media that he used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William had done digital painting since
attending UCOL with illustration classes.
He used a Wacon tablet. Currently for his
digital painting William uses an Intous 5
small tablet connected to a Raspberry Pi
computer. The software he uses is GIMP 2.8
and it is running the operating system
Rasbian (Debian Jessie, Stable). William uses
a batery pack plugged into the Pi to power it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William uses the Pi to edit text. Plugging
in a keyboard and uses terminal with the
softwarenano to edit text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digial later focused on portraits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;using GIMP, an free and open source
raster graphics software. William began by
painting on a windows desktop and laptop,
later switching to Fedora and Debian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait
and figures were drawn from references on
RedditGetsDrawn. During this period,
William would draw portraits of people and
give them the drawing - taking a photo for
his own reference.
At the bottom of the page he would sign
with wcmckee artcontrol.me and write 'cc by'
on the piece of original artwork.
These were mostly completely in pencil
and coloured pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William is also passionate about working
with children. In 2014 he volunteered at
Whaihanga Early Learning Centre,
where he would work collaboratively with
kids, often on the same piece of art,
using oil pastel, pencil, and coloured
pencil.
He was influenced by the children's artwork
- often redrawing elements of their works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William took the liberty of licensing these
works under a CC BY licence - photographing
and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me.
He would create large chalk murals on the
ground outside, with children requested that
he draw comic book characters like the Hulk,
Spiderman, Bane, and Batman. These mural
pieces were created on the fenceline of
Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School.
Swarms of school children would crowd the
fenceline - watching and discussing the
artwork with him. They were blown away
from how quickly he worked and the
quality of his artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A hope of mine," William says,
"was the children would learn that art was
about sharing and remixing - something
Creative Commons has at its core."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William has since become a volunteer for
Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand,
helping to spread the word about
Creative Commons licensing in
the Hamilton region.
If you want to volunteer, get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BY MATT MCGREGOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing ideas for the 2016 OER Sprints.
To get involved, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join our organising group (on a platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Check out the existing task-list for the&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;tt class="docutils"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, line 15)&lt;/p&gt;
Bullet list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;events&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LETS SPRINT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organise the Open Educational Resource
Sprints 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are getting a critical mass of schools with Creative Commons policies, enabling teachers to legally share and
collaborate. This is good news, of course,
but the risk is that the policy becomes just
a piece of paper, to which no one really
pays all that much attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites/resources etc should be clearly state the work is under a Creative Common
licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show how kiwi teachers can work together to
make new, open resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's a sprint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An idea borrowed from the technology sector,
where it is sometimes called a hack&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The GovHack' weekends are one example of technologists, designers and a range of
other volunteers coming together to make new
products and services from open government
data and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example that inspired us was the Media
Text Hack, a team of educators and
researchers got together to write an open
Media Studies textbook. It's now an assigned
undergraduate textbook at the University of
Otago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other example was the Oppikirjamaraton
(Finnish for - textbook marathon). This event
involved about thirty Finnish mathematics
educators writing a new textbook for schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These events give us working models of how
an OER Sprint might work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organising teams have been open about the
problems they had during the event and what
they would do differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At tech conferences sprinting is often used
an event where people work towards a goal -
often bugfixes in software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DECISIONS, DECISIONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still details about the event to figure out.
Opened up the process early, everyone can
see how decisions are being made. In the end,
we will have a model that schools,
associations and informal groups of teachers
can use to sprint - or hack - their way to
the resources they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do we need to think about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be reflecting on these issues over the next few months - both here at
NZCommons and in our open Loomio group, with
other volunteer organisers. But here's a few
to get us started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long should it last for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some sprints last for two days, others just
one. Some sprints keep strict,
family-friendly time-frames, while others
keep working deep into the night. We ought to keep it short and sweet i.e a busy
9/10-5 - for either one or two days, though
with an expectation than many participants
won't be able to commit for the full period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology the bane of many such events.
We'll need to find a technical platform that
works for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial thinking is that Google Docs
will work fine for small teams, and is a
technology many teachers already use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bigger projects with many more
collaborators  have had issues with using
Google Docs, and more technical platforms
like Github have also been problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants, volunteers and facilitators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be a two day event. Saturday and
Sunday are usually good. There is the idea
of opening the conference on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What skills do we need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the best mix of practising teachers, non-teaching subject-area experts
(like academics), facilitators and other
volunteers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to keep the focus of the event as by
teachers, for teachers, with other volunteers
serving to support the needs of the
participants teachers. At the same time, we
want to take advantage of the collective
expertise of everyone who wants to help out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's a resource?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other sprints have focused on making single book (or book-like entity). My feeling
is that a resource is whatever the heck
participants decide to make on the day,
and that this should be the decision of each
individual team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team formation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what constitutes a team? How many people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3-6 seems about right, though I'm not sure
about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about virtual participation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we're working on Google docs, this is
fine though virtual collaboration
can breed those dreaded Technological
Problems, which well want to avoid. But we
shouldn't put any barriers
on people participating, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will the events actually look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will involve people sitting at tables,
talking and typing. Minimise
the amount of scene-setting at the
beginning, and look to have a plethora of
helpers to solve problems as they arise.
This will involve giving clear guidance
beforehand. A minor amount of faffing about
at the beginning is probably unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much does it cost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our point of view, there are two sorts
of costs: event costs; and outreach costs,
before and after the event. For the event,
we'll need funding or in-kind sponsorship
to cover food, drink, venue, technology and
other incidental costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the outreach, we'll need funding to get
resources on CC and OER to as many teachers
as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, how many events?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were not sure, yet, though before the end
of the year, we should make some initial
committments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keen to have them anywhere and everywhere,
though this will depend on us getting strong
local support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BY MATT MCGREGOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post introduces some ideas for the 2016 OER Sprints. If you want to get involved, you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;join our organising group (on a platform called Loomio)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;check out the existing task-list for the events&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LETS SPRINT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, we announced our plans to organise the Great 2016 Open Educational Resource Sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said in my post last week, were getting a critical mass of schools with Creative Commons policies,
which are enabling teachers to legally share and collaborate. This is good news, of course, but the
risk is that the policy becomes just a piece of paper, to which no one really pays all that much attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's our opinion at CCANZ that its about time we put these policies into practice, and show how kiwi teachers
can work together to make new, open resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, the Sprints. But when you announce a new idea like an OER Sprint, you quickly find people asking a few quite important questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT'S A SPRINT, ANYWAY?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets begin with the first one. What's a sprint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A resource sprint is an idea borrowed from the technology sector, where it is sometimes called a hack
'The GovHack' weekends are one example of technologists, designers and a range of other volunteers
coming together to make new products and services from open government data and information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the education sector, one of the big examples that inspired us was the Media Text Hack (theres that word again),
where a team of educators and researchers got together to write an open Media Studies textbook. It's now an assigned
undergraduate textbook at the University of Otago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other example - which itself inspired the Media Text Hack team - was the Oppikirjamaraton (that's Finnish for - textbook marathon).
This event involved about thirty Finnish mathematics educators writing a new textbook for schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these events give us working models of how an OER Sprint might work.
Both organising teams have also been open about the problems they had during the event (such as technology -surprise, surprise)
and what they would do differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DECISIONS, DECISIONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these fantastic examples, there's still a heap of details about the event that we need to figure out. We've decided to open
up the process early, so everyone can see how our decisions are being made. Hopefully, at the end, we have a model that schools,
associations and informal groups of teachers can use to sprint - or hack - their way to the resources they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do we need to think about? I'll be reflecting on these issues over the next few months - both here at NZCommons and in our
open Loomio group, with other volunteer organisers. But here's a few to get us started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long should it last for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants, volunteers and facilitators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What skills do we need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And whatâs the best mix of practising teachers, non-teaching subject-area experts (like academics), facilitators
and other volunteers? My feeling is that we need to keep the focus of the event as âby teachers, for teachers,
with other volunteers serving to support the needs of the participants teachers. At the same time, we want to take
advantage of the collective expertise of everyone who wants to help out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's a resource?&lt;/p&gt;

His artsite is artcontrol.me and is available under a
Creative Commons BY 4.0 licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During highschool William spend the majority of his time in the Design creating designs in Freehand, after finishing he attended UCOL in
Palmerston North. Here he became seriously interested in drawing and gained confidence - many thanks to his drawing tutor Mark Dustin. He worked
mostly in a a4 visual diary which became a habbit and still carries a sketchbook whereever he goes with him now.
During his time at Palmerston North School of Design he registed the domain artcontrol.me and creating the site&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;artcontrol.me: The Art Of William Mckee.
Was created in 2010 as a site to host his artwork. Previously he had used DeviantArt and Wordpress.com blogs to host his artwork.
The site was originally hosted by GoDaddy the operating system CentOS, and powered by Wordpress. Originally it was licenced under  CC NCBY
but William later decided that the NC licence was wrong and switched to CC BY. He later swtiched from WordPress to Nikola - a Python static
site generater. He later also switched hosting to DigitalOcean with the operating system Debian.
The majority of his machines are running Debian. Fedora is on a couple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first he choose to licence this under a creative commons nc by licence. Later making the decision for cc by removing the nc licence.
He has many problems with the nc licence and would never use it again and don't see many reasons for people to use it.
He has a problem with education, govt, and publicly funded works to be under nc. The good thing the majority of govt seems to be under cc by.
Certain schools in the county have a nc licence which is troubling - especially when all schools have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended The Learning Connexion.
It was here that he focused on life drawing which he was only dabbed with in the past.
GIMP was used for all the digital paintings created. He painted on a windows desktop and laptop.
Later he switched to Fedora and Debian. He painted rarely but enjoys painting with the Raspberry Pi computer and
Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait and figures were drawn from references on RedditGetsDrawn.
He would draw portraits of people and give them the drawing - taking a photo for his own reference.
At the bottom of the page he would signit with wcmckee artcontrol.me and write cc by on the piece of original artwork.
These were mostly completely in pencil and coloured pencil.
William is passionate about working with children. In 2014 he volunteered at Whaihanga Early Learning Centre.
His Mother - Linda worked there as the head teacher. His favourite activities were the art area and build structures with wooden blocks.
He would work collaboratively with kids often on the same piece of art. Oil pastel, pencil, and coloured pencil were the most commons media
choices. He was very influenced by the children's drawings - often redrawing elements of their works. A hope was the children learn that art
was about sharing and remixing - something Creative Commons has at its core. William took the liberty and licenced these works under a cc by
licence - photographing and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me. He would create large chalk murals on the ground outside.
Hulk, Spiderman, Bane, and Batman were common requests of characters to draw from the children. These mural pieces were created on the fenceline
of Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School.
Swarms of school children would crowd the fenceline - watching and discussing the artwork with him.
They were often blown away from how quickly he worked. Some of the collab works were developed further with digital painting. He volunteered at Fairfield Community Centre where he drew with children aged 5 to 12.
Felt tip pen was the main media here and he applied much the same techniques with collaboration as at Whaihanga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2012 to 2014 william would draw and paint people from  the Reddit subreddit RedditGetsDrawn. Some days he drew up to thirty people. He
recived many positive comments from people thanking them for their artwork.
Sadly in 2014 William was banned from submitting artwork to the subreddit - being accused from the mods that his artwork is troll artwork.
His website features in in the RGD as exams of troll artwork.
William created the website GetsDrawn.com that scrapes RedditGetsDrawn for reference images as a response for this. This has enabled him to have
an offline version of all the reference images on RedditGetsDrawn.
When asked for a unban he gets laughed at by the mods.
The mods are a bunch of SJW woman who are talentless - in partical ItWillBeMine.
William still draws people on RedditGetsDrawn and sends them artwork but doesn't submit it publicly as it is always deleted by the mods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>artist</category><category>copyright</category><category>creativecommons</category><category>it</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/creativecommons.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2015 03:18:26 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
