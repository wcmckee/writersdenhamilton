His art can be found at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://artcontrol.me/"&gt;http://artcontrol.me/&lt;/a&gt; and is available under a
Creative Commons Attribution (BY) licence. William is also a supporter and user of open source software, and is passionate about
early childhood education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I use Creative Commons as an artist in the hope that it helps promote my artwork, and to make the world a better place," says William.
"Others may find uses for my art and even make money from it, good on them!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William seriously became interested in drawing after leaving high school and attending UCOL in Palmerston North.
There he had a drawing tutor, Mark, who inspired him to keep a drawing journal. William gained the habit of carrying a sketchbook wherever
he goes, along with a pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his time at Palmerston North School of Design, William created the site artcontrol.me: The Art Of William Mckee.
It was hosted with GoDaddy and ran CentOS. The site was powered by WordPress, switching later to Nikola.
He later also switched this to DigitalOcean with the operating system Debian, which is used by the majority of his machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While William was always interested in using a Creative Commons licence, he at first chose to use a more restrictive
Attribution-NonCommercial (BY-NC) licence for his artworks, though soon chose to use the liberal Attribution (BY) licence.
William doesn't see many reasons for artists to use NC licences, and finds it especially problematic when NC licensing is used by governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As William argues, "Tax payers have already paid for the material. It should therefore be licensed under the most liberal licences
(perhaps even public domain/creativecommons zero). This allows the most freedom for people to do what they like with the content."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William also point out that the "Non-Commercial licences are hard to interpret, as was noted in a German court case in 2014,
which strongly limited the interpretation of NC to 'personal use.' Similar problems with the interpretation of NC could exist
in other countries. This is why I think government - and everyone, in fact - should avoid the NC licence.
I would actually prefer that the NC licence not exist in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing, Williams says, is that the majority of New Zealand government works released under CC seems to be under CC BY,
though he is concerned that some schools seem to have adopted an NC licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended The Learning Connexion, where he began to focus on life drawing, using GIMP,
an open source drawing and design tool. William began by painting on a windows desktop and laptop, later switching to
Fedora and Debian. Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait and figures were drawn from references on RedditGetsDrawn.
During this period, William would draw portraits of people and give them the drawing - taking a photo for his own reference.
At the bottom of the page he would sign with wcmckee artcontrol.me and write 'cc by' on the piece of original artwork.
These were mostly completely in pencil and coloured pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William is also passionate about working with children. In 2014 he volunteered at Whaihanga Early Learning Centre,
where he would work collaboratively with kids, often on the same piece of art, using oil pastel, pencil, and coloured pencil.
He was very influenced by the children's drawings - often redrawing elements of their works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William took the liberty of licensing these works under a CC BY licence - photographing and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me.
He would create large chalk murals on the ground outside, with children requested that he draw comic book characters like the Hulk,
Spiderman, Bane, and Batman. These mural pieces were created on the fenceline of Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School. Swarms of
school children would crowd the fenceline - watching and discussing the artwork with him. They were often blown away from how quickly he worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A hope of mine," William says, "was the children would learn that art was about sharing and remixing - something Creative Commons has at its core."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William has since become a volunteer for Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, helping to spread the word about Creative Commons licensing in
the Hamilton region. If you want to volunteer, get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

His artsite is artcontrol.me and is available under a
Creative Commons BY 4.0 licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During highschool William spend the majority of his time in the Design creating designs in Freehand, after finishing he attended UCOL in
Palmerston North. Here he became seriously interested in drawing and gained confidence - many thanks to his drawing tutor Mark Dustin. He worked
mostly in a a4 visual diary which became a habbit and still carries a sketchbook whereever he goes with him now.
During his time at Palmerston North School of Design he registed the domain artcontrol.me and creating the site&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;artcontrol.me: The Art Of William Mckee.
Was created in 2010 as a site to host his artwork. Previously he had used DeviantArt and Wordpress.com blogs to host his artwork.
The site was originally hosted by GoDaddy the operating system CentOS, and powered by Wordpress. Originally it was licenced under  CC NCBY
but William later decided that the NC licence was wrong and switched to CC BY. He later swtiched from WordPress to Nikola - a Python static
site generater. He later also switched hosting to DigitalOcean with the operating system Debian.
The majority of his machines are running Debian. Fedora is on a couple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first he choose to licence this under a creative commons nc by licence. Later making the decision for cc by removing the nc licence.
He has many problems with the nc licence and would never use it again and don't see many reasons for people to use it.
He has a problem with education, govt, and publicly funded works to be under nc. The good thing the majority of govt seems to be under cc by.
Certain schools in the county have a nc licence which is troubling - especially when all schools have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended The Learning Connexion.
It was here that he focused on life drawing which he was only dabbed with in the past.
GIMP was used for all the digital paintings created. He painted on a windows desktop and laptop.
Later he switched to Fedora and Debian. He painted rarely but enjoys painting with the Raspberry Pi computer and
Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait and figures were drawn from references on RedditGetsDrawn.
He would draw portraits of people and give them the drawing - taking a photo for his own reference.
At the bottom of the page he would signit with wcmckee artcontrol.me and write cc by on the piece of original artwork.
These were mostly completely in pencil and coloured pencil.
William is passionate about working with children. In 2014 he volunteered at Whaihanga Early Learning Centre.
His Mother - Linda worked there as the head teacher. His favourite activities were the art area and build structures with wooden blocks.
He would work collaboratively with kids often on the same piece of art. Oil pastel, pencil, and coloured pencil were the most commons media
choices. He was very influenced by the children's drawings - often redrawing elements of their works. A hope was the children learn that art
was about sharing and remixing - something Creative Commons has at its core. William took the liberty and licenced these works under a cc by
licence - photographing and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me. He would create large chalk murals on the ground outside.
Hulk, Spiderman, Bane, and Batman were common requests of characters to draw from the children. These mural pieces were created on the fenceline
of Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School.
Swarms of school children would crowd the fenceline - watching and discussing the artwork with him.
They were often blown away from how quickly he worked. Some of the collab works were developed further with digital painting. He volunteered at Fairfield Community Centre where he drew with children aged 5 to 12.
Felt tip pen was the main media here and he applied much the same techniques with collaboration as at Whaihanga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2012 to 2014 william would draw and paint people from  the Reddit subreddit RedditGetsDrawn. Some days he drew up to thirty people. He
recived many positive comments from people thanking them for their artwork.
Sadly in 2014 William was banned from submitting artwork to the subreddit - being accused from the mods that his artwork is troll artwork.
His website features in in the RGD as exams of troll artwork.
William created the website GetsDrawn.com that scrapes RedditGetsDrawn for reference images as a response for this. This has enabled him to have
an offline version of all the reference images on RedditGetsDrawn.
When asked for a unban he gets laughed at by the mods.
The mods are a bunch of SJW woman who are talentless - in partical ItWillBeMine.
William still draws people on RedditGetsDrawn and sends them artwork but doesn't submit it publicly as it is always deleted by the mods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>artist</category><category>copyright</category><category>creativecommons</category><category>it</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/creativecommons.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2015 03:18:26 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
