weekend here for kiwiPyCon.
My experience started when I showed up at Catalyst IT on
Thursday and volunteered for AV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian was running the AV who I had previously worked with
at LCA2015. The setup for AV was much the same as at LCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of us were trained (or in my case - refereshed) for
AV. Toby (who primary did still photography), Jen (who
worked in track one on the camera), and Zane (who worked
with me in track 2). I had originally signed up to work on
track one but shifted around on the Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Friday I arrived at 8:30am and setup to record
the keynote. I was going to film it but Ryan suggested
that it would be a good idea to let someone who hadn't
filmed before have a go - so I let Jen on the camera.
I was switched to track two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived on time on Saturday to watch the keynote by
Katie Bell. I left partway thorough the keynote to setup
video in track two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recording of the first talk began after morning tea.
DVswitch was the software for recording - the ability to
live edit - switching between the camera and laptop with
keys 2 and 3 allows the videos to be uploaded to the
internet with minimal editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day was smooth with minimal problems. The most major
problem was at the beginning of a talk I was unable to
switch to the slides. The frame would just freeze on the
camera. I kept it on the camera and contacted Ryan.
DVswitch had to be reset and some settings changed to get
the laptop feed working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the final session on Saturday I was tired and needed a
break. Zane took over the camera - he needed a break from
the sound. I stayed for a bit to make sure Zane was fine
with camera duties, then headed outside for some fresh
air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday morning I slept in and awoke at 8am. I knew I
was going to miss some of the keynote but wasn't worried
as I wasn't filming it. I txted Ryan to let hime know that
I would be late and will arrive partway through the
keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took turns with Zane on the Sunday switching between
camera and sound. I also had the opitionity to mic
presenters which I hadn't done before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were less talks on the Sunday than Saturday so
wasn't so worn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the conference finished I walked from the university
to Hornby. It wasn't as bad walk as I was expecting,
taking an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I inspired to work on after attending KiwiPyCon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most inspiring talks for me was a lightning
talk given by a girl catrin who talked about CodeClub,
and Ministry Of Education.  I talked to her after the
lightning talks at afternoon tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>article</category><category>conference</category><category>python</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/kiwipycon-travelbac.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>kiwipycon2015</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/kiwipycon2015.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first KiwiPyCon I attended was back in 2013. The
location was the AUT campus in Centeral Auckland
This year it is in Christchurch. I have been typing
python code since 2011 so it took me 'several years
to discover the conference. In 2013 I was living in
Levin and took the night bus from Levin to Auckland
on Friday night. I arrived at KiwiPyCon early on
Saturday morning. I had paid for a student/unwaged
ticket. I didn't attend the dinner on Saturday
night. I had my dell laptop with me and can remember
typing python code with IPython Notebook. I didn't
attend KiwiPyCon last year in Wellington. Bit silly
of me really - but I did watch the talks on YouTube.
This year I applied for finacial assistence and they
were very generious - my ticket was paid for along
with $100.00 towards my travel. I am going to be
staying at a friends of a friends place in chch.
It's a caravan so unlikely to be anything special.
I'm not worried though - as long as I have a roof
over my head and a shower I will be fine. The
caravan is located at a park where there are showers
and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year is the first year that the conference is 3
full days. In the past its been just the Saturday
and Sunday. Though I believe in the past they have
had tuturials on the friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've taken a look at the talks. I need to decide on what
track to go to - 1 or 2.
Things I'll mostly be interested in hearing about:
Web Development. API, static blogs, design.
robotics. Raspberry Pi.
Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am less interested in database and cloud related topics.
Things like Openstack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am planning to work on Nikola on the Friday. In the
afternoon there are  beginner tuturials, and sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a call on the mailing list for people to give a
interest of any topics to sprint on.
There was mention of pip,
and my Nikola.
The creator of Nikola Roberia even expressed interest to
me on Twitter that he may be advable for hours/day if it
goes ahead.
I'd like to see it happen. I will be working on it and
encourage others to join me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what types of people I would get. Some
may be experts with static blogs. Others may never of
heard of them.
I'll be willing to help people in getting started with
Nikola, but the best thing to do is read the site and
use it before the spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas for spring - Excel doc.
Lists all issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November there is the NaNoWrite. Write 50,000
word novel. 2014 was the first year I attempted this.
I'd like to write a self biologey. Or maybe a autobiography
on someone.
My best friend Peter could be interesting to write 50,000
words about.
It might be better to take his character and write it
into a fiction character&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently sitting in Auckland airport. I have my boarding
pass and just waiting to board. It's an overcast day, but
it's not raining suprisinly.
When I first arrived I had a panic attack and went through
the security without getting my boarding pass. As soon as
I was through security I relized my mistake and went back
to collect my boarding pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I am on flight to christchurch. The
takeoff was smooth and I have an excellent window
view of New Zealand. Just experienced a little
turtalence but it was minor. The flight is only
going to take an hour. We are above the clouds and
looking down all I can see is ocean and some
coastline. I was sitting at the wrong gate - I
thought it was gate 30, but
but turns out it was gate 21. I noticed when someone else
was asking about Jetstar and they were redirected.
I quickly packed my Pi up and headed to the correct gate.
I was one of the last thoough the gate but I wasn't late.
There is no free food or drink on this flight.
I have a bottle of water and two sandwhichs. They are in my
bag though which is in the overhead lockers. Once I land
in Chch I will put on warm clothes, eat my food.
I then need
The food and drink service has just closed - we have
almost arrived in chch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python related news the third and final keynote has
been announced - Alison ? who works for Dropbox.
This means that there is three female keynote speakers
at KiwiPyCon. This has to be a first.
It's great there is such a large number but I do hope they
are not keyspeakers just because they are female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie comes from a education background so the talk will
likely not be very techniqaual. Lets hope it's not wishy
washly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once they announce trays up I'm going to switch off the pi
and pack it into my laptop bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight is almost over. It was a smooth flight but my
stomach is a bit sore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mountains have snow on them. It is very mountionous.
This has to be the south island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly I left my camera at home. I guess it's one thing
I won't lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plane is almost completely full - I'm at the back row
(30) and there is no one in the five seats beside me. '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to shutdown. Till we arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;testing the pi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I went to CatalystIT and heled cutting volcous
items. First was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules for hackathons:
If you get asked to volunteer you must. AV is preference
but you must be involved early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build website for each hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build static site for hackaton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking sms app. Testing file one two. Three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics of interest. Static Blogs. Nikola.
