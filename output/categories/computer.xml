This tablet is old but seens to work ok.
One problem I have with it is that I have been unable to download.
I just ssaved it incase I lose my work. That is not going to happen is it?
This november there is going to be a worldwide writing challange - nanowrite. It involves writing 50,000 words in a month.
2014 was the first year that I attempted the challange. I managed 8,000 works or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas for the book this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autobio - write about my life so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RedditGetsDrawn - write about redditgets drawn. A day in the life of it will be mine.
