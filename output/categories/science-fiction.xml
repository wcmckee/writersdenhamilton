The food was sweet fresh cream buns and savery muffins. He scanned the area for an
exit. This was too many people for him to handle. He noticed a door leading to a balconey on the far side of the room. He would have to make
his way through several grouups of people. He took a deep breath and procided to walk towards the door. One step in front of another.
'excuse me', he spoke as he made his way past the group.
He finally reached the door and squeesed through the part opening.
Outside on the balconey he felt better. The room felt crowded but out here there was room. The sun was shinning and Joey was able to find a seat
and started to eat his cream bun.
techfuncmasters was the company hosting the conference. It was a three day event where business and technqiue people from a range of companies
got together and shared and collabrated on ideas. The name of the conference was api days.
Joey was a contracter and had just started a new project of developing some addons for gimp. The addons that he had to build was to make it
posible to give the computer a collection of digital paintings, and the video process of the paintings - and a blank canvas. The computer
would then mimic the original painting - creating a new painting with help from a new reference image. Joey wasn't sure who he was creating
this software for - but it didn't really matter. The main thing for joey was that he was getting paid well - and that the addons would be
open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey heard steps behind him. He was no longer alone out there. A woman in her 20s approched and sat near him. She too had came outside to eat
the morning tea. Joey checked her name tag. Vanessa May, TechFuncMasters, Developer, it read.
'Hi there', spoke Joey after he finished the mouthful of cream bun.
'Hi, How are are', Vanessa replied. 'I'm great, enjoying the conference, some great keynotes. I'm Joey'. Joey shock Vanessas hand.
'Vanessa', she replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony watched as Joey and Vanessa meet. It was as predicted. History had told that these two would meet this day. October 14th 2065 at
10:50am. Antony knew his job was done and started to walk out of the building. The place was crowded as he started to push his way to the
exit.
'sir, wait', he heard a voice behind him. He ignored it. It was important that he got out of the building in the next 5 minutes. He kept
moving, at a faster pace. 'STOP', the voice yelled. Antony started to run. The last thing he remembers is a buzzing sound. Then darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'So where do you work', Vanessa asked Joey. His badge read Joey McFurson. The company line was blank. His role was set to Developer.
'Oh i am doing some contract work currently. Mostly image maniplation kind of stuff', Joey replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light flickered as Antony opened his eyes. He was strapped to a chair. His mouth gagged to stop him from yelling. The room was small.
A table was in front of him along with a similar chair. On the table was a bunch of medical and electrical devices.
'What the hell', he thought to himself. He heard a door open. In walked a solid built man in his 40s. He had long black hair, brown eyes,
and walked with a slight limp. The man sat down in front of Antony. 'I am Detective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day3.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>nanowrimo15-day2</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day2.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah heard the jug boiling from behind the door. She had just showered, rinsing the blood from her body. Antony had given her some clothes
that belonged to his exwife. Antonys wife had been in a terrible accident and passed away. Antony had never remarried but instead focused on
his work. Shortly after his wifes death he was hired to develop software to develop code for to get the computer to paint lines. Antony was
a specialist in writing code for graphics. Antony never meet the man who contracted him. All the code was uploaded to a server. He was given
a private key to connect to. When the code was uploaded to the server it is moved off the server and original content deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony opened the pantery cabnet. He was hungry but wasn't quite sure what to make. Noodles seemed like a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah opened the steel door and steped into the room. Antony was standing in front of the cubard. He seemed to be deciding on something
to cook. 'Take a seat', he spoke. 'Thank you', Sarah replied, moving towards the table and chairs. 'You must be starving, is there anything
in partical you feel like?', asked Antony. 'Yes I am hungry, whatever is fine', Sarah replied. 'Fried noodles it is then', Antony reached
for the Japanese style noodles. 'Cut two onion', he spoke. A metal mechanical arm with a knife attached to the end on the bench started to
cut up two onions. 'auto fried noodles'. 'fried noodles started', replied the machine. Antony moved towards the table where Sarah was sitting.
'I will let the machine take care of dinner so we can talk', Antony remarked as he took a seat oposite Sarah. 'I will like you to explain
all events you can remember from the past twenty four hours', Antony asked Sarah. He took out a pad and pen.
'Where to begin', Sarah replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah looked back at the Earth from the capsule. She was being sent to the moon on a mission to recover prototype 6b345 ArtContol. System
control had lost contact with it during a recent mission. It had been with 5 other prototype ArtControl machines exploring craters of the moon
before its radiosignal failed. It was suspected that its system had been taken over by a hacker and it was being remotely controled by someone
on Earth. This was dangerous as this particle machine was designed with nuclear capabilities.
Sarah closes her eyes as she exited the Earth atmospher. The ship she was traveling over was running the AI ArtControl system headless. This
allowed for ArtControl to control the ships functions so that the crew were able to relax. This cut down the risk of mistakes as ArtControl
was designed to not make a mistake.
Once on the moon Sarah would carry a Raspberry Pi computer hooked to her life support that would assist her on the mission to retreve prototype
6b345. The Pi was running the AI Artcontrol.
Sarah stepped out of the pod. The her suit had been modified to allow her to walk on the moon with similar gravitiy to that of Earth.
20 meters in front of her she spotted the moon bugey. This was going to be used to get to the crater where system control last had contact
with 6b345. The bugey was equiped with GPS that would be controled by ArtControl to take her to the crater.
She started moving towards the bugy. 'Sarah, this is system control', came a voice on her headset. 'confium, This is Sarah', she replied.
'We notice you have arrived and exited the pod, status update' the voice asked. 'Everything is fine, moving toward the transport'.
'Roger that, ArtControl will take over once you reach the transport, system control out'. The transmission ended.
Sarah continued moving towards the transport. After finally reaching the transport she climbed into the seat. It was a single pod that had
been designed to move over the toughest condidtions - perfect for the rocky texture of the moon.
Sarah reached for the Raspberry Pi from her belt and conected it to the transport.
The Pi switched on with the power given to it from the transport. The monitor in front of Sarah switched on. Bios loaded, and the kernal
booted. Once the operating system was loaded the transport began moving forward. Sarah straped herself in as it began to speed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a distance the prototype 6b345 ArtControl watched the transport zip accross the moons surface. 6b345 stood still, knowing the humans
would not be able to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3km till destanation the monitor display. Estamited time of arrive: 45 seconds. Sarah could see the crater now that they gotten closer.
The transport started to slow down. It stopped just before reaching the crater. Destanation reached the monitor displayed. Sarah unbucked
her belt and climbed out of the transport. She moved into the crater. The place was a mess. Scraps of metal were lying around. She reached for
the camera in her belt and started to document the evidence. Something had happened her and it was her job to figure it out.
She moved deeper into the crater. What is this metal? She thought to herself, it was nothing like they had on Earth. It must of been some
sort of alien technology. Sarah bent over and gathered some of the metal depree into a evidence bag. Scientists back on Earth will analize
this. It may shreed some light on what happend to 6b345.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6b345 watched as the human gathered evidence from the site. It had activated its camo that rendered it invisible to the human eye.
It watched as the human placed an object into a bag. 'Sarah, this is system control', a voice blasted. 'We are getting some crazy
radio signals from your position, status update please'. The human lifted her arm towards her ear. 'Sarah', 6b345 thought to itself.
It loaded its database of human personal. 'Sarah Clarkson, 27 years old, American', The database showed. 'More detail', 6b345 loaded
more detailed information. 'Born New York December 15th 2021 at 5:32am to Danny and Mary Clarkson. Attended New York State School from
ages 5 till 17, studied computer science in New York University for 4 years. Currently working for NASA as a AI developer.'
6b345 shutdown the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sharp bass noice blasted in Sarahs ear. 'System Control, was that you', asked Sarah over her mic. 'Sarah, This is mission control.
We did not transmit, is there a problem?', replied system control. 'hmm strange, it was a bass sound happening in my headset', Sarah
remarked. "I'm done here, heading back to the pod". Sarah turned around and headed towards the transport. She needed to head back to
the pod and return to Earth with the evidence she had gathered. She reached the transport that would return her to the pod.
The process was the same as before - she took the Raspberry Pi from her belt and attached it to the transport. The monitor booted up
and transport turned around - heading towards the pods location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6b345 held on to the transport as it started to move towards the pod. They were planning on traveling on the ship with Sarah. The camo
was running out of power though so it may need to hide in the pod during the return trip to Earth. This could cause issues if Sarah notived
him onboard. There was enough power to get on the pod and take off, which is the important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah pulled up at the pod. She disattached the Raspberry Pi from the transport and unstapped herself. She was still getting a stange
bass sound from her headset. She moved towards the pod and took off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she was exiting the moon there was a large explosion. She looked down in horror to see that the moon had split, creating several
parts of the moon. The parts were attached only just, but this couldn't be good for Earth. The effects this would have on Earth would
be devestating. Maybe she wouldn't be ableto return to Earth. Mars was an option - Humans had set up a base on the planet incase
something ever happened. It was mainly run by ArtControl machines but several hundrad humans were preserved there as a backup for
humankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6b345 had curled into a small cube to fit inside the pod. They had made their way into the supply and invitory area where hopefully
they wouldn't be noticed. To preserve power they switched off the camo and would switch it on if someone enteredd the area or once
they landed back on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day2.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
