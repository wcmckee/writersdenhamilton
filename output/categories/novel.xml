He was a baby and has no memory of what Earth was like. He got sent back to Earth before
an alien that was currently living on Mars. Antony's real Father is a dying Alien who comes to Earth and creates a half alien, half human. An AI military
machine. Leaves with Family - Sarah and Joey. President dies, 15 more years later Moon explodes. Humans discover a metal on the Moon that can be
recreated for space craft travel and time displaced, Humans get wiped out when Moon explodes. They send people back in order to fix certain
mistakes. For example:
Sarah gets sent into the future to when Antony is an adult and is on Mars.
Detective gets thrown around allot. Presidents Speech 3 copies. Save President. Save Joey. Baby Detective.
Joey. Adopts Antony.
Memory saved on a robot version of himself on Earth. Everyone left behind their mind in their file. After the 80,00 people are launched to Mars
everyone remaining on Earth gets an AI version of themselves made that will continue to live their lives after the world is destroyed.
The AIs were developed to be the same as the day when the attack on Earth happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah stepped forward. She wasn't allowed to take her teddy bear in with her to the machine that would scan her - to create the copy of herself.
This copy will be interlinked with her - it will have all the memories that she has and will continue to grow with what Sarah does till the
attack happens. She wasn't the only one getting scanned - it was a worldwide effect to scan everyone so that their memory could live on after
everyone on Earth dies. The scanning technology had been made possible through an alien Metal that had been brought back from the future by a man
named Detective. He was the savior of mankind.
In the future Detective hadn't gone back to with the alien metal and it had lead to just a full scale attack on mankind - with no one surviving.
People had been sent back to try to stop the attack but each time failed. The attack had to take place, but the humans couldn't prep for the attack.
The Humans in the future later work out that they needed to send someone back to help save mankind. Detective is the one that does this.
The machine had finished scanning Sarah body. An AI robot would now be created from the scan. Sarah fingers tingled as the red and purple lasers
scanned her body. They told her that it was important for her to stay still during the scan. She obeyed but didn't like it. Everyone in the world
were having to go to these areas where they will be scanned. There is a cutoff date and if you don't get scanned by then the police will hunt you
down, arrest you and then force you to be scanned.
No one got to see their AI robot. It would become active after they are killed in the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah walked into the NASA building. It was her first day on a two week training plan for a mission to the Moon. Details were scarce but there were
rumored that NASA had lost control of one of their AI robots that were on the Moon.
She was told that she will be trained in a isolated area - with just the voice of 'system control' giving her instructions. She will have no
interaction during training with any other humans or robots.
Sarah made her way down the hallway. The large building was empty, it was only her here. For the next two weeks she will follow instructions from
the speaker or 'system control' for the training. She wasn't allowed to bring anything with her and everything would be supplied to her.
The walls were white and there were no windows. She made her way down the hallway and got to the end. This was her bedroom for the next two weeks.
She had just taken a 12 hours plane trip to the middle of no where - she didn't even know where she was. She had been blindfolded before leaving
her home - taken in a car to an airfield, boarded a plane, and flew. Once in the air her blindfold was taken off but it was added again shortly
before landing.
The plane had dropped her outside this building. She was told to enter the building. The doors locked after she entered and she would not be able to
exit. Any attempt to leave the building would lead to mission failure. After arriving she was given 10 hours to rest and get a sense of her
surroundings before her training began. She was tired so headed straight to her bed room. The room was plain. She changed out of her lab clothes and
into her PJ's, climbing into bed. She fell straight off to sleep. She awoke to an alarm. She had slept for 8 hours and had two hours to get ready
for the training. Still sleepy, she dragged herself from the bed and into the shower. The plane trip had given her jet lag.
As she was in the shower a voice played over the speaker, 'Good Morning Sarah, how are you feeling?', it spoke. 'I am OK, feeling a bit jet lagged',
she replied. 'Do you want to delay the training?', the voice asked. 'No I am ready', she replied. 'Very well', it spoke. Sarah turned off the
water and climbed out of the shower. She dried herself and put on her clothes. She walked out of the bathroom and towards the kitchen. Here she put
the jug on and started to make herself a coffee. She opened the fridge. It was a smart fridge and would automatically order more food as she ate
it. It was fully loaded. She reached for the milk and placed it on the bench. She opened the cubard and pulled out the cereal and a plate. From the
top draw in the kitchen she got a spoon. She poured the cereal into the bowl and milk over that. She sat at the table and ate the cereal and drank
her cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony sat in his chair hunched over his laptop. The monitor flickered with green text. The background was black. Two of his arms typed well the
other two patted his cat - Blitz. He had located a set of NASA robots on the moon and was attempting to hijack one - 6b345. He had modified the
kernel of the machine that allowed him to remotely control. He just needed to add a air-gap so that NASA isn't able to find it once he takes full
control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6b345 and the other robots were walking through a crater on the Moon. The team of robots had been assigned the task of checking for soul information
on the Moon and were in the middle of their mission. 6b345 was carrying a bag of soil and heading towards the transport to take the soil to the main
base. As it approached the transport Antony successfully added the air-gap to the machine and was able to remotely control 6b345 without NASA being
able to reconnect or detect who was doing it. It would just look like 6b345 disappeared off the grid.
Antony picked up the controller. He had a video link with 6b345 which showed the first person view of 6b345. Antony could see the transport just
ahead. He tapped buttons on the controller is 6b345 dropped the soil sample. The other Robots noticed this and turned to high alert. Antony
pressed keys on his keyboard, 'battle mode', was active. He aimed 6b345 weapons at the other robots and fired. One, Two, Three. They were all gone.
Now that they were destroyed he needed to plant the explosives on the Moon. Using the controller he controlled 6b345 to arm the explosives.
Now that they were set it they just needed to wait for Sarah to arrive on the Moon and 6b345 would board her ship.
Antony went to sleep but set an alarm so that if there was any movement on the Moon he would be woken. He stood up from his computer chair and
walked out the room. Blitz followed him out of the room. Blitz would follow him everywhere he went. It was a loyal creature. Antony opened his
office door and walked outside. He was now in the foylor area. This was a large open area. A large table with chairs scatted about. A kitchen,
fridge, gas stove and oven, and a large long bench.
Behind the kitchen was the hallway that lead to his bedroom. He walked towards the kitchen and down the hallway. He was tired and it had been a long
day but the attempts to take control of 6b345 had been a success. Down the hallway he reached his bedroom door. He turned the door handle and walked
in. His bedroom was plain and clean. A double bed was in the far side of the room, with a dressing table beside it. Set of draws where he kept his
clothes. Antony was tired and flopped into bed, falling asleep. Several hours pass and an alarm sounds, waking Antony up. Movement on Mars. Antony
drags himself out of bed and moves into the office. He still has control of 6b345. He controls 6b345 to look around and spots of woman who has
arrived on the Moon. Sarah. Antony is hungry so moves to the kitchen to make himself a snack. Noodles seems like a good choice. He boils the jug.
Opens the freeze dried noodles and removes them from the plastic. He places the noodles in a plate and pours the boiled water over them. He places
a plate on top of the noodles and waits for them to cook. Once they are cooked he drains the water and eats the noodles with a fork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day13.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>nanowrimo15-day12</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day12.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanessa had landed on Earth. She had been sent here to investigate what happened before humans colonized Mars. The leader of the Mars colony Master
Antony was the one that active the 80,000 human souls - saving the human race. Him, along with his Robot 6b345 and his cat Blitz lead the humans
in their expansion of Mars.
Antony advised against any humans returning to Earth, saying that the world had become toxic and humans would never be able to survive on the
planet. He had told them the story of the human traitor - Sarah whom was the one that had destroyed the Earth and almost destroyed the 80,000
humans that were being preserved on Mars. Antony and 6b345 thankfully stopped her.
Vanessa never trusted Antony and suspected something fishy about him. She had fled Mars and landed on Earth in order to find out more information
on what might have happened.
She had also heard stories of a man named Detective whom in the future is sent back to the past to warn the human race about their appending doom.
They had records of an alternative time-line where humans didn't launch the 80,000 human souls - causing the human race to be wiped from existence.
Antony announced to the world that it was him that sent back Detective to the past in order to save man kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony looked out over the Mars landscape from his palace. The 80,000 humans moved about in their lives below him. The majority of them bowed down
to him but he was concerned for a small group calling themselves the 'Human Revolt League' that were leading a fight against him. They struggled
with the fact that he lead the humans. Vanessa May was their leader. She had recently escaped from Mars and Antony and his Generals believe she
may have returned to Earth. He had sent a hunting party out to find and destroy her. If she discovers what really happened in the past, everything
that Antony worked for could be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony had stayed behind on Mars but had sent Blitz and 6b345 (his Generals) to Earth in order to find her. As he watched the City he had build he
heard the door open behind him. It was one of his Human servants. 'Master, the Generals are ready to leave', the Human spoke. Antony nodded. He
turned around and headed towards the door. He would head to the ship launch pad to watch his Generals leave Mars for Earth. With his alien
technology, technology had grown dramatically compared to that of old Human tech on Earth. The ship would land on Earth within a couple of hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blitz had developed since Antony first created her on Mars. She had gained the ability to speck English. Blitz and 6b345 were about to board the
transport ship to Earth when Antony entered the area. 'I just wanted to wish you the best for the trip', Antony spoke. 'You will find Vanessa and
any other rebels and kill them'. Blitz nodded, and boarded the ship with 6b345. Antony watched as the ship took off, leaving Mars for Earth.
Antony had been attempted to develop a fix for his body. Since he had escaped to Mars he had lost his full human form and was forced to stay in his
half-alien half-human form.
The ship that carried Blitz and 6b345 zipped across space. As it entered the Earths atmosphere it burnt up - killing Blitz and restoring 6b345&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Earth Vanessa discovered a building that was hosting a conference. The conference was ran by robots and all the attenders were robots. She
managed to sneak in as a delegate. Here she was able to meet the robot version of Joey. The human version of Joey had programmed the robot version
of himself to reveal the information about what had happened on Earth, the Moon, and Mars. Joey was the one that witnessed Sarah being killed by
Antony and 6b345 on Mars. Joey was hunted down and killed by Detective (sent by Antony). Before Joey was killed he programmed the robot version
of himself with the memory of the murder and the robot Joey was able to reveal this to Vanessa.
The conference ended when debree of Blitz and 6b345's ship hits the building. Vanessa manages to escape and travels back to Mars with the robot
version of Joey in order to reveal to the Humans of Mars that it was in fact Antony that killed Sarah, that Sarah wasn't a traitor. With Blitz
and 6b345 dead and destroyed as they entered Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the keynote Vanessa looks around to find Joey. There were many robots here and he was hard to find. She might need to wait till morning
tea to find him.
Vanessa spots Joey on the balcony during the morning tea. She approaches him and talks to him normally. She needs to get him alone and reset his
system in order to reprogram the machine to tell her what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during afternoon tea that the debree hit the building. It caused a power failure. It was Vanessa's last chance to get the information from
the robot. She grabbed him, hit the shutdown button and carried him into one of the side rooms. The building was falling apart from the debree so
she needed to move quickly. The building was building evacuated.. She lay Joey down on the table. Flipping him over on the back he had a casing
that she used a screwdriver to open up. a terminal window opened up. It was here that she would be able to extract the information out of Joey.
She plugged in a USB disk. She typed some keys and the data transferred from Joey to the USB. Transfer complete the terminal showed. She unplugged
the USB, screwed up the cover again and reset the machine. Hopefully he would reset with full information remembered. Joey started up, announcing
that he was in a special mode. This meant that Vanessa was able to take him back to Mars, and along with the USB of data show the Humans of Mars
what really happened to Sarah. She didn't have time to view the data. The building was falling apart. She needed to get out of there. Joey was
confused after the reboot and all the new data that he was able to access. Vanessa lifted him up and carried him out of the room. The hallway was
empty, all the Robots had evacuated the building. She made a rush for the escalator, and out of front door. Just as she made it out the front door
the building behind her exploded. It sent her and Joey forward, but she managed to roll and was uninjured. Robots were standing around steering at
her in confusion. She better get out of here quickly before anyone suspects anything. She is a human on a planet controlled only by robots.
She picked up Joey who was making 'Danger, Danger' noises. She carried Joey towards her ship. It was a small ship but she was able to fit herself
and Joey in it. The groups of robots had forgotten about her, going back to talking among themselves. She started the ship up and left Earth.
Her mission on Earth was complete, she just needed to return to Mars and show the Humans of Mars the true intentions of Antony.
She looked down at the Earth as she left, wondering what it would of been like all those years ago when Humans lived there. The majority of Earth
now was a barren wasteland with several Robot cities setup. Now that she was back on the ship she was able to take off the breathing device she
had been using to breath the Earths air. It allowed her to breath the air on Earth for a short time. The ship was auto drive mode now - heading
towards Mars.
Looking out the other window she steered at Earths Moon. It was in fragments. Was it Antony that had blown up the Moon? He had always told them that
it was Sarah that had blew up the Moon. 6b345 had attempted to stop her but failed. 6b345 was captured by Sarah and held hostage as she fled to
Mars.
The view of the Earths Moon fragments turned faded into darkness. Vanessa moved from the area into where Joey was being kept. Maybe he will be able
to answer some of her questions now. He was layed down on the table, powered down. Vanessa hit the reboot button on the back of him. He booted up.
'Access recent memories', She spoke. A list of his recent memories appeared on the terminal. She scrolled through them. It was all events that had
happened on Earth - events she wasn't interested in. What she was looking for was events on the Moon and Mars. Then she found it. A strange statues
code that had been hidden - and only revealed now that she had reprogrammed. A video started playing. It was a recording in first person view. It
showed Joey - the human version, waking up on Mars. The City looked small - almost a just a hut. She recognize the area though. This is where it
all happened. It showed Joey watching two figures - they must be Sarah and 6b345. Vanessa had never seen a photo of Sarah but she knew it was her.
The two figures are heading towards The City. Blitz is outside the doors, pacing back and forward. Blitz spots the two figures and hurries inside.
Antony appears behind Sarah with a Ray Gun. He is in his half-alien half-human form. Vanessa wonders when Antony lost his full-human form.
The footage shows Antony pointing the Ray Gun at the back of Sarah head and firing. 'YES', says Vanessa excited. She had it. She had the evidence
that showed Antony was the traitor - that he lied to the 80,000 humans about the events that took place.
She carried on watching the footage. It shows Antony and 6b345 burning the body of Sarah. Would the body have decomposed by now or would there be
a chance to recover the body? Thought Vanessa. 6b345 was the one that dug the hole well Antony watched. Vanessa understood now that 6b345 was with
Sarah when she arrived on Mars. 6b345 betrayed Sarah. It was being controlled by Antony all along. It was Antony that had taken control of 6b345
when it was on it's mission on Moon. He must of remotely accessed the robot from Mars. He used 6b345 to lay the explosives on the moon that would
then detonate when 6b345 left the Moon.         ``&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day12.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>nanowrimo15-day11</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day11.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antony walked over to Bliz and patted
her. He had had the cat for 6 yeasrs.
She pured as he stroked her. He had
started mixing his genes with that of
animals, to see the effects that it
would cause. No one would ever have as
much alien gene as Antony for he was
half alien and human. Blitz had been
created with a mixture of Antonys
Alien/Human genes and mixed it a a
third - cat gene. This caused some
interesting effects in the creature.
Antony had focused on the cat gene in
so the cat had a cat like body and legs.
It was coloured blue - something it
inherited from his alien genes, the cats
face was human like, with human looking
eyes. It's puples were cat like. It had
a flat human nose. It's mouth was human
- and had wiskles coming out the side.
Antony had hoped that Blitz would be
able to speak, but so far it could
only meow and make sounds that sounded
like the alien native language.
Antony had been on Mars for the past 14
years. He had escaped Earth when his
identity was discovered. His Father -
Loth'Rak had setup a base for him incase
he ever needed to leave there. He needed
to stay in his half form and had since
lost the ability to switch back to full
human. He was loney alone on Mars so
therefore had created Blitz in order to
keep him company. The lack of
convosation was annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah and 6b345 made their way through
the deserts of Mars. Up ahead they
spotted a small base came. The two moved
towards it with caucion. A cat like
creature was
walking around outside. Sarah and 6b345 had
never seen anything quite like it before.
'Is it a mutation', Sarah asked 6b345.
The database system part of 6b345
analized the creature. 'its returned three different
dna types - cat, human and an unknown
alien dna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cat spotted the two sneaking up to
the hutt. It rushed inside in fear.
Sarah moved towards the front door.
She felt at gun in the back of the neck.
The voice spoke, 'Dont move or I will
shoot'. She started to move her arms. A
blast sound blasted. Sarah dropped to the
ground. 'Shouldn't have moved', the voice
spoke. It was Antony. 6b345 rushed over
to Sarahs body. 'What have you done',
6b345 yelled at Antony. 'She moved',
replied Antony. 'We needed her to finish
the mission', explained 6b345. 'No we
dont, we can do this ourselves. Help me
move the body'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony and 6b456 moved Sarahs body.
Antony picked up a shovel and threw it
at 6b345. 'dig', he ordered. 6b345
started to dig the whole to bury Sarahs
body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective was crushed under the vevhile
that had rolled on him. Up ahead he
watched as the presidents car flipped.
He used his strength to move the car
from ontop of him. His body would need
several minutes to recover. Detective lay
there and breathed slowely. His body was
in pain, but it was recovering quickly.
He stood up and started heading down
towards the Presidents flipped car.
From a distance it looked too late - the
car was in flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he walked, he heard another explosion
behind him. It was aimed at the crowd of
people whom had been watching the
Presidents speech. The president was his
piriority. The car was on fire and tipped
upside down. he opened the backdoor and
pulled the President from the car. He
was too late. The President was dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BREAKING NEWS. The President is dead
but NASA will continue with the mission
to launch 80,000 human souls to Mars is
still a goahead. A new President is
currently being swarn in and has given
his blessing to the mission. The people
will be forzen and transported to Mars.
Should there come a need in the future
to active them - we will do so.
The President is expected to give a
briefinng in two hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa didn't know anyone at the
conference. Knowing noone wasn't such a
bad thing though, it allowed you to meet
new people easily and not hangout in
usual groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She drank her cup of coffee well standing
in among a group of people. They were
talking about a new security bug found
in a web app. She sipped her coffee as
she listened to the convosation.
People started to move into the main
area for the keynote speaker.
Vanessa followed the group into the room
and found a seat to watch the keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey awoke. He was surrounded by a red
sandy wasteland. He doesn't reconise it.
It doesn't look like Earth. He can see
a base in the distance. He walks towards
it. Inside is a alien creature and their
alien cat. He witnesses the alien creature
killing Sarah. Alien creature tries to
hunt him down. He escapes and is brought
back to his own time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once back in his own time he can't
remember correctly what happened, but
puts the pieces together - making sure
that humans will find out if they ever
return to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I like the idea of blowing up the moon.
Enough explosives to blow it up.
It's science fiction. I can do whatever
I want', spoke Antony. 'It was the humans
that killed my race'
Antony had tracked a group of artcontrol
robots that were expoloring the Earths
moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone seems to be escaping to Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All characters have to die by ray
guns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenge for Antony since he is the last
remaining part-alien of his race&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once humans are settled on Mars they
want to go back to Earth in order to
discover what happens.
Sarah was to do it but she ended up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa is the one that goes back to
Earth in order to discover what happened
to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony and 6b345 active the 80,000 humans
They become the rulers of the human race
on Mars - the humans not relizing they
in fact have sinister plans.
Vanessa discovers that Sarah is killed
by Antony. Detective is first sent back
to save Joey but he is later sent back
in order kill Joey. It is Joey that lets
Vanessa know in the future that Sarah is
killed by Antony and that it was Antony
that blew up the Moon in order to destory
the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa finds out about Antony being
evil and goes back to Mars and kills him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Mars they build a statue of Sarah
holding her teddybeer in order to
remember her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artcontrol is walking down the street
with a Raspberry Pi doing digital
painting in GIMP. He admires the statue
and carries on walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day11.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>nanowrimo15-day10</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day10.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah, Joey and 6b345 pulled up outside an abanded looking apartiment building. Sarah and Joey wondered why they were here. They wanted to get as
far out of this area as they could. 6b345 had insisted that it was important that they were here, that certain events would take place that were
crucial for later. They trusted the robot. The three got out of the car and headed towards the front door. The door looked like it had been sealed
with a woodern plank but someone had broken it - breaking into the building. The three walked though the door - if someone was in the building they
hadn't bothered to lock it behind them. They traveled down a fowyer area and reached a kitchen. The three said nothing.
Sarah, Joey and 6b345 walked into the bedroom. They had been alerted to a loud banging sound and wanted to investage it. 'Perhaps it was a
cat', Sarah spoke. 'Don't be silly, a cat wouldn't make a sound that loud', replied Joey. They looked around the room for server minutes before
leaving again. The room was empty, but there was something strange about the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective found a needle in his pocket. Hes could use it inject himself or the unconsious dream version of himself. He decided to inject himself.
As the liquid enters his blood system he watches as the unconconsious version of himself fade. Was it him waking up now? He walks out to the
kitchen where the three characters are standing. Their faces are still a blur, but are becoming clearer. He stepped out the frontdoor without
anyone noticing.
Detective decided to head back to the room which he woke up. Perhaps it be better to wait for the womans return? He exited the apartiment building
and headed back to where he was eariler. The visions of the two worlds had vanished. Perhaps the injection that he had given himself had fix it.
Memories of this world started to return. He remembers capturing the man tied to the chair - Antony. During questioning he was sent back in time,
to before the Presidents speech. It is here that he warns the world about the Earth being blown up. They prep 80,000 humans with the metal that
Dective brings back with them - this will allow the 80,000 to survive on Mars. Shortly after he is injected with a substance he is brought back
to the current time - this happens when he is being chased with the President by the terrorists.
The President doesn't survive the crash. The world believes that the attack was on the President, but really it was aimed at Joey - a 12 years old
boy that would become important in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ItWillBeMine was waiting for him when he returned back to the building. She told him that he needs to travel back again to the Presidents speech in
order to save a 12 year old version of Joey. His first mission of letting the humans know to send the 80,000 humans to Mars was a semi-success but
it will fail if Joey is killed. Detective agrees and is sent back again. When Detective is sent back his body melfunctions causing him to be
stranded in a limbo of half present, half past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah awoke. She peaked out the window and all she could see was the red sandy desert that was mars. She had some of the strangest dreams.
Looking over she noticed 6b345 still plugged in charging. Looking at her watch - he had 15 minutes of charge left before he became active. She
was starving and got out of bed and headed towards the kitchen. Food was limited on Mars but there was some sealed frozen meal that she was able
to microwave. She placed the plastic free dried meal in the microwave and turned it on for 2 minutes. She admired the view from the large glass
window outlooking Mars. Humans had build this facility to be a safehaven. Her thoughts wondered back to Earth and wondering what it would be like
there now. The explosion on the Moon would of caused massive deaths to the world. Her thoughts were interupted with the alarm of the microwave going
off. She opened up the microwave and pulled out her breakfast. She opened the top draw and got a knife and fork. She sat down at the table and
ate her food. It tasted like bacon and eggs.
As she ate she heard clanking sounds of 6b345 heading towards her. 'Good morning', Sarah spoke. 'Greetings', 6b345 replied back. 'Did you sleep
well', it asked. 'Yes very much so', Sarah replied. 6b345 nodded, sitting down at the table with Sarah. 'So whats the plan for today? Will we make
it to the transport ships', asked Sarah. 'That is the plan', replied 6b345. 'We will leave once you are ready'. Sarah finished her food and packed
her bag. She was ready to leave. The two walked out the door - into the desert waste of Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loth'Rak had crash landed on his home planet. He didn't have the energy to travel back - it would be too late. Years would of passed on Earth
when he traveled through the blackhole. His home planet was in rubble. Once it had been a beautiful tropical planet inhabited with his race. That
all changed when humans fired the missiles through the blackhole - destorying his home planet and killing everyone. Loth'Rak was on a nearby planet
when the attack took place. He watched in horror as the missles apeared out of the blackhole and traveled towards towards his planet. He spent years
searching the universe for intelligence life like his own. He found it - Humans.
He had been on the planet to collect some new minerals that he was going to take back to his planet for his scientists to analyze.
He traveled back to his planet with haste but hovered over the planet he knew no life survived. When he discovered Earth thousands of years later
he landed on the Moon first to leave the bombs in case it was the humans that had attacked his planet.
Once returned to his planet he activates the bombs. Sarah is leaving the moon when this happens. This causes the human race to be wiped out on
Earth. Sarah travels to Mars to activate the 80,000 humans.
Detective is sent back in time to make sure the 80,000 humans are launched to Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarahs ship orbited Earth. She had been gone for 10,000 years. Her crew consisted of 6b345 (whom she meet when she first arrived on Mars),
D'Zorge, Shad Ducote, Ostis Bedjouki, and Gasuya Aman. The crew were tasked with returning to Earth in order to understand what had happened
10,000 years ago.
Sarah remembered when she was a child. Growing up on Earth. She remembered the day when everything changed. It was the day of the Presidents talk.
She had watched the talk on the television with her Mother. As she orbited the Earth she held in her hand the very same teddy bear that she had
that that of the Presidents Speech. That day humans sent 80,000 human souls to Mars to preserve humankind, should anything every happen to Earth.
And it did. When Sarah was in her 20s she was on a mission to the Moon and as she was leaving the Moon it exploded, causing mayhem on Earth.
She traveled to Mars where she actived the 80,000 human souls. There she lead the humans to grow and expand. No one really knew what happened to
Earth, about why the Moon was blown up. Sarah and her crew were here to find the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective watched from the Earth surface as Sarahs plane landed. He had been stuck on the planet for the past 10,000 years. Alone. During the
attack on Earth his body was in another time, so when he came back he was still alive, but everyone else was gone. With the alien metal installed
in his brain and the injections his body was able to survive on Earth. Though he was stuck between two times - sometimess seeing visions of the
past - if you could call it the past.
The ship landed and the crew exited. The world looked completely different to how she had imagined it as a child. No planets were able to grow so
everything had turned to desert. Life on Earth was no more. The crew stepped forward. They had testing instruments to test the Earths soil and the
air. After testing the Earth they would travel to the Moon which was split into three main fragments - alot of it had moved away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day10.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>nanowrimo15-day9</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day9.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah and Joey watched as Loth'Raks transport pod left Earth. Sarah held in her arms a small child brought to them by Loth'Raks. The had been given
instructions to protect him at all costs. They would do just that. Loth'Raks had named him Antony and they had decided to keep the name.
Currently Antony was in full human form. They  were given a device by Loth'Raks that allowed Antony to switch to half-human, half-alien form.
Joey tested the device on Antony. Sarah jumped and almost dropped the child as he suddenly turned blue, and sprouted another two arms. He started
making sounds in a language they couldn't understand. Joey activated human form again. Loth'Raks told them that it was important that forms be
switched at least once a year. If Antony doesn't switch he could be permanently stuck in either form.
Along with the child, and form switch device they were given a metal substance. Loth'Raks told them they could give this to the authorities in
exchange for Antony to be kept safe.
They walked back inside with their new child.
Several miles away a man was out walking his dog when he came across what looked to be a weapon or gun of some sort. He didn't recognize it and
handed it into the local police station. The police were thankful for him handing it in - they too were unsure what it was. They would hand it
onto the government.
Joey and Sarah would have big decisions to make later about telling Antony about his Father and his origins. For now though - he was a baby and
didn't understand. They had several years to wait.
The three walked in the front door. Sarah had activated 6b345 to clean up the dishes. It was a fully automatic robot that was capable of many
tasks - including cooking and dishes. She had activated it to finish off the dinner she started but was distracted with Loth'Raks arrival.
For some reason the 6b345 unlike many other editions was mute. It followed the families orders though - which was the main thing.
6b345 watched out of the corner of it's eye the family walk back in the house. They were holding a child. The machine scanned the child - picking
up unusual patterns. When situations like this happen the data is sent back to headquarters and an investigation is activated. The govt may become
involved. Nobody has any privacy when these machines are in their lives - but they don't know that.
Sarah tucks the baby into his cot before sitting down at the dinner table with Joey for dinner. 6b345 brings over dinner. Roast lamb, potatoes,
carrots, and peas. Their favorite. 6b345 pours them a wine each and sits down at the table with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years passed and Antony grew just like any other child. He attended Kindergarten and started school. Once he had started school Sarah and Joey
decided that it was time for him to learn what he really was. They sat him down and explained about his Father Loth'Raks and how he was the last
of his race and dying - that Antony was now the last remaining member of his race - though he was only half. They explained to him about the
form switch device and showed him how it worked. That he had to switch forms at least once a year.
Sarah and Joey had activated the form switch device for the past 5 years - on the anniversary that Antony was brought to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day at school during break he told some of the other children that he was half alien. They didn't believe him. To prove it he activated
the form switch device - switching into his true form. The other children were amazed and rushed off to tell their teacher. She told them to
stop making up stories. Antony had switched back to human form - the teacher pointed out that Antony was perfectly normal, just like them.
Though the CCTV at the school had captured Antony's transform. Within an hour the media had gotten hold of the footage. Both media and the
military surrounded the school and Antony's home.
Should he ever be discovered Sarah and Joey had been given a plan. They were to activate a transport pod that would take Antony to Mars - far
away from the humans.
When Antony saw the military and media heading towards his school he knew something was wrong and that they may be coming for him. He activated
his form switch device and headed out the building towards home at a fast pace. Sarah and Joey had told him to go to a field out the back of his
home. It was there that a transport pod would be stored and he could use it to escape to Mars.
He made it to the field. Military and media surrounded his home. He could see Sarah and Joey being cuffed. He want to go and save them. To bring
them with him. He knew he couldn't. He activated the pod and climbed into it. It was already set to Mars. He hit the green button and the pod took
off. People noticed the roaring sound of the engines and pointed the television cameras at the scene. The military attempted to shoot down the pod
but it failed - taking off and leaving Earth.
Antony regretted showing his classmates the form and wondered what was going to happen to Sarah and Joey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony awoke from the freeze. He was still tied to the chair. The room was empty. Detective must of already returned to this time period. He yelled
for help. To his surprise - Sarah walked into the door. 'What the hell happened? Did Joey and Vanessa meet?', Antony asks Sarah. 'Yes everything
went perfectly', Sarah walks up to Antony and unties him from the chair. 'Do you have your form switch device', She asks him. 'I don't need it', he
replies. 'I can control the forms with my mind now'. Once untied Antony activates his true form - the half human and alien. Sarah is impressed. You
have learn allot in all these years. 'How long had it been', She asks. 'In Earth years it has been 40 years', Antony tells her. 'wow it feels like
longer', Sarah says. 'I remember the day still clearly today - Joey and myself were so frightened when the police showed up at the door looking for
you. We didn't tell them anything. They arrested us. I then remember seeing your ship take off. I then knew you would be safe'.
Antony nodded and smiled. 'We can talk more later. For now we need to get out of here, Dectecive may return'.
Sarah and Antony walked out the door. Antony lead in his alien form. 'We are going to need to move fast', he said. 'I need you to climb onto my
back'. Sarah nodded and climbed onto his back. 'Hang on'. Sarah gripped Antony's shoulders. He started to dash forward, knocking out the front-door.
Outside it was raining and they raced down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective continues to drive down the road. The visions of reality and the dreamworld are turning into a blur. In the dreamworld it's a sunny day,
but in relatiery it's dark and raining. It gives a strange effect to the world. The car that he is following in the dreamworld begins to slow
down. Three people get out of the car - a man, a woman, and a humanoid robots. He slows down his car and watches their next move. Do you think
they could see me? He wonders. He opens the car door and heads towards them. They seem to be moving at a slower pace that relatery. He yells at
them, 'hey guys, what are you doing?'. They continue walking away from their car, ignoring him. Maybe they can't see him he realizes. He goes up
to get a closer look at them. He hopes he could recognize them. Like the man who was shot with the Ray gun their faces are a blur and he is unable
to know who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three of them walk into a building. It looks like someone had already broken into this building. The front door had been sealed with a wooden
plank but it had been removed and the door opened with something. No attempt had been made to secure it again. He stands behind the three characters
as they open the door and walk inside. They have no idea he is there. They enter into a foyer area and walk down till they get to a kitchen.
In Detectives world the kitchen looks clean, like someone was living here. In the dreamworld it's a mess, someone was living here but during their
breakfast they abadanded the building. Old eggs and toast were rotting on the table, Fly's swarming.
In the dreamworld he heard a thud on the floor. It came from the bedroom. Everyone noticed it. The dream-characters started to make their way to the
bedroom to investigate. Detective wanted to make it first. He rushed in front of the dream characters who were moving slowly. Inside the bedroom he
saw a version of himself. It was Detective that was in the room. Was it him that broke into this building? He wasn't sure what to do, but he didn't
want the dream characters to find the body. He picked the body up and dragged it towards the closet. He opened it up and pushed the body inside.
Just as he closed the closet the dream characters walked into the room. They looked around the room to see what the thud was. 'Perhaps it was a
cat', one of them said. 'Don't be silly, a cat wouldn't make a sound that loud'. Detective prayed that would walk out and ignore the closet. His
wish was granted. The three of them turned around and walked out of the bedroom - back to the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day9.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>nanowrimo15-day8</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day8.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albumin and Detective together watched the camera footage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah and 6b345 stepped through the steel door at the landing pad. They had made it to Mars successfully. Sarah was now tasked with finding the
ships that had launched and landed on Mars and activating them. She was a little uneasy about 6b345. He original mission was to go to the Moon in
order to find him as there were suspensions that he had been hacked and was acting as a rogue robot. Could the friendly nature he was putting on
just be show?
6b345 scanned Sarah. The readings came up with an unusual high anxiety level. 'Are you feeling OK?', 6b345 asked Sarah as they walked down the
hallways. 'Oh I'm fine', replied Sarah. She stopped holding her head. Sarah experienced a flash vision. It was a scene from Earth. She was with a
man. Their arms were linked. They were standing outside a building door. Rain poured down. In the vision she knocks on the door twice and another
man - someone with a blurred face lets them in.
Sarah is brought back to relatey by 6b345. He slaps her across the face which knocks her out of the flash. 'Sarah I don't think you are well',
6b345 tells her. 'That was the strangest thing ever', Sarah explains. 'Come on, the sleeping bunkers are just up ahead', 6b345 tells Sarah. How
does he know so much about this facility Sarah thinks to herself. Her head still hurts but she continues down the hallway towards the sleeping
bunkers. After everything that had happened, some sleep would be good. The two walked through and sliding door. It was there there were sleeping
bunks and power for 6b345 to charge. 6b345 walked up to the charger and plugged itself in. 8 hours of charge would give it months of charge.
Sarah dropped her bag and climbed into the bed. She was excused and fell asleep immediately. After her sleep the two would go and search for these
80,000 human souls that need to be activated on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa stepped up on the escalator. It had been several months since she had been at a tech conference and it always put her in a good mood when
she attended. Being a female meant that she was often gloratized at these events - something she felt a little uneasy about. She had only good
experiences when attending these events. She was warned to watch out for sleazes when she started attending these events. So far she had only good
experiences.
She stood in the line waiting waiting to sign in. The line was around eight people. It was moving quickly. She had printed a bar code out that would
be used to sign in. She was finally at the front of the line. 'Hello, I'm Vanessa May', she told the woman behind the counter. The woman smiled and
said hello. Her bar code was scanned and she was given a lanyard that had her name attached to it. She made her way to the foyer area where coffee,
tea, and juice was being served. The area was full. People were gathered around in their groups chatting among themselves. Vanessa went over to
the group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loth'Raks scanned the Earth. His ship lay idle
just outside the Earths atmosphere. He was the last
remainder of his race. He had been in search for
other intelligence life and had found it. On this
distant planet that the locals called Earth. He was
uneasy about making himself known to the life. When
&lt;a href="http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day8.html#id1"&gt;&lt;span class="problematic" id="id2"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;his race had done so before thousands of years ago it
lead to almost their extinction. Loth'Raks was growing
old and needed to pass on knowledge about his race to
these humans in the hope that they may be able to save
him.
He had successfully captured several of the lifeforms
which he was keeping alive in a water like substance.
Unlike his race the humans needed oxygen to survive.
They would never be able to survive on the alien home
planet but he had made it possible for the humans to
breath on Mars, a planet not far from Earth.
He had tested mixing some of his alien DNA with that
of the humans, to see the effects it would create.
The first couple of tests failed but he had just
successfully completed a mix.
Loth'Raks lifted the child from the bed. It's skin was a
faint blue colour - like his own. It's eyes had a cat
like purple and colored blue. It's nose was much more
flat than normal humans. It had a normal human mouth.
Instead of two human arms it had four. Loth'Raks also
had four arms. It had no reproduction system -
something that the humans and his race had very
different. It was a healthy child though. The humans
may never accept him, but they might care for a half
breed - someone part human and part alien.
He would make the humans promise to care for the child
in exchange for the metal that was inside of his race.
It flowed through their body in a liquid form - but
when exposed to oxygen it would turn to a solid. This
meant that Loth'Raks would be unable to survive on Earth,
the insides of his body would harden - killing him. He
had set foot on Earth - wearing a special suit that
stopped his blood metal from hardening. This is how
he had captured the humans.
He was due to expire and had found two humans that were
capable of raising his child - Sarah and Joey McFurson
they were called. They lived on a small farm outside
of Texas. He had organized to meet them to leave the
child. Once the child was safe he would travel back to
his home planet to die. Along with the child he would
leave behind the metal. He had programmed the metal to
malfunction and stop working if any harm would come to
his child.
The child would be able to switch between two forms - a
fully human form and the alien half breed form.
He had shown Joey and Sarah how to switch the child
between the forms, and later when the child is older
they would be able to switch. He named the child Antony. After his grandfather. Loth'Raks stood outside the wooden farm house. He wore
his productive suit in order to stop the oxygen from
contacting his body. In his arms was the small child -
Antony. It was currently in human form. He switched the
child to hybrid form, then back again to human form.
It seemed to work correctly.
He walked forward towards the house. Knocking on the
wooden door. Sarah answered and greeted him in. They
moved to the lounge area. Joey was sitting in a armchair
in the lounge. Sarah had been preparing dinner.
Joey stood up when Loth'Raks walked in the door.
'Is this him', Sarah asked. Loth'Raks had problems
understanding human speech and had installed a
translate device. He got Sarah to hold the device and
speak into it. He replied by nodding.
He handed the child along with the a small caps of the
alien metal to Sarah. He turned and started to walk out
the door. He needed to return to his own planet. Much
longer on this planet would kill him. Sarah and Joey
followed him out the door watching him take off in
his small transport pod. Loth'Raks knew he would never
see them again, but the child would be safe.
Sarah and Joey watched ass the transport pod took off.
The aliens main ship was outside of Earths atmosphere,
but it was too dangerous for the ship to enter.
Loth'Raks made it to his main ship. He docked the
transport pod and exited. He moved quickly to the
control room and started to enter cords for his home
planet. The ship would need to travel through a black
hole in order to get home.
He looked around the ship one last time. Loth'Raks
noticed his ray gun was missing. He had taken it to
Earth in case of trouble. He was sure he had brought it
back on the pod but it was gone. 'What could have
happened to it', he wondered. It was too late though,
he didn't have enough time to return to Earth to
retrieve it.
He just hoped that the gun wouldn't fall into the
wrong hands - the power it would offer the user is
unknown. He tried to forget about it and started the
ships engines. He had located a nearby black hole that
the ship was traveling towards. He strapped himself in
it was always a bumpy ride through a black hole -
something he did not enjoy. He could see the black hole
ahead. The ship was moving towards it. He braced himself
for impact. Shutting his eyes his ship entered the
black hole. A flash of visions happened as the impact
happened. He observed a human man shooting another with
Loth'Raks ray gun. A second vision appeared this time
was of the ray gun being turned into a large weapon.
It was launching attacks on his home planet. The
humans were the ones that had almost wiped out his
race. Was it his fault? Was he to blame for leaving
the ray gun on Earth? He couldn't return. He orbited
his home planet. The black hole had done as predicted
and sent him home. Home to die. The humans must of used the metal he left along with
the ray gun to send the missiles back in time -
thousands of years to wipe out his race. He was annoyed
with himself. Why did he even trust the humans to begin
with? He thought of Antony and how he will grow up
among a race of traitors.
Loth'Raks ship entered his planets atmosphere. It was
traveling fast, and he knew impact was going to be bad,
though not as bad as the experience of traveling the
black hole.&lt;/p&gt;

It happened the day as predicted. The President would give his speech. Joey would be killed in the explosion. The
events that happen when Joey is killed are worse for mankind than it keeping him alive. Detective is sent back again to save Joey. He is in that
time zone 3 times. Different versions of him have different tasks to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah received the artcontrol machine at school. They already were on Mars. The escape from Earth was just a simulation. The moon never exploded.
Earth was fine. Humans could live on Earth. They were tricked into it by advance AI intelligence. The ability to move time backwards and forward.
Sarah goes to space in order to find the metal. Explosion occurs when she is leaving the Moon. Travels to Mars instead of Earth as she loses
contact with Earth. Mars was backup plan if anything went wrong. She had instructions to active the 80,000 human souls being stored on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective searched the crowd for Joey. He would be twelve years old and with his parents. Several times he had attempted to save Joey but each time
failed. Detective had finally worked out that he needed to used a stun gun on both parents in order to get Joey out of there. The perfect time to
reach him in once the first bomb activates. This happens in front of the presidents car. The second explosion hits the crowd. Detective spots Joey.
The first explosion. Detective walks towards Joey. He looks down on him and holds out his hand. He tells Joey that he must come with him.
Detective grabs the child and pulls him to safety. Shortly after getting Joey to a safe spot Detective is pulled back to where he and Antony are
frozen in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah is sent into the future and meets Antony. Humans have successfully returned to Earth. The room is shattered but they use a similar substance
as on Mars to stay alive on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah travels to Moon when the explosion happens. She sends back Detective from Mars to Earth on the day Humankind was wiped out in order to change
some events. Future version of Detective attempts to kill Sarah
and Joey. It's never sunny and always rains in restored future Earth. The past - Presidents speech is sunny. Moon is gloomy and quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mars is red/orange. Frozen rivers. Joey looked across the landscape. He had never experienced anything like
it. They raced across the land. Breathing was strange. Air thinner than on Earth. The landing site for the 80,000 humans sent from Earth over 1000
years ago were up ahead. '&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey would explore the area. Had 3b456 to assist him in finding out what happened. Humans may or may not be active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony makes sure that Vanessa and Joey meet. They have a child - Antony. Detective interferes and attempts to stop Antony from completing his task.
Antony is captured by Detective and uses the time split. Sends Detective back to before the Presidents speech. Sends Antony into future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albumin is searching for both of them. When Detective saves Joey from the explosion he is pulled back into the future where he is in the room
with Antony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony is the grandson of Albumin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future version of Sarah is on the Moon the day of the Presidents speech. She discovers the alien metal and sends a sample back to the past
before the Presidents speech in order to save Joey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah gets trapped in the future and can't get back. Joey remarries Vanessa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future Detective attempts to kill Sarah and Joey with Ray Gun. He is pulled back to future when he is in the abandoned building with Sarah and
Joey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micheal is killed when Moon explodes by drowning. He is in his office when the tidialwave hits the shore. Everything floods.
He watched the sky as the moon shattered. The Earth rocked causing an increase in global temp. Places that were warm - people burnt to death.
Polar caps melted causing worldwide flooding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey and the robot reach the landing site. Sure enough the 80,000 humans had landed and were ready to activate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah and the robot reach Mars and discover that the 80,000 human didn't make it to Mars. Needs to send back Detective to make sure the launch
happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uganka is killed by Detective when he is hunting down Joey and Sarah. He is shot in the back with Detectives ray gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective sneaks  around the back of TechFuncMasters he knows of a secret passageway where he can get in. Sneaks up on Uganka as hes about to
unlock the door for Joey and Sarah - but times it badly and Sarah and Joey escape. Detective kills Uganka with the ray gun.
Detective chases after them but loses them. He discovers them when they enter the building he is staying in.
At that point he is pulled into the future where he is in a room with Antony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArtControl is in future Mars walking down the road creating artwork on their Raspberry Pi. Breathing in air created from the alien metal.
Electronics are being charged from traces of metal in the air. Ultra fast network speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey and Sarah had gotten far away from Detective. There was no way that he would catch them by now.
The ray gun that he carried used much more advance tech that what they had in that time. He must have brought it
back with him from the future. Sarah was driving well Joey slept. Joey dreamed of the
events that had happened that evening.
Everything was going as planned. He had received the
private key which he loaded a virus onto it so that the
ships would fail when the ships attempted to leave
Earth.
He had walked down the road in the rain with Sarah. They
had knocked at the door. Uganka was spouse to answer and
let them in. Then they were spouse to experience the time
split that sent them into different time periods.
Instead Detective killed Uganka and attempted to kill
them.
They shouldn't be in this time. Both Joey and Sarah
should be in separate times.
His mind was a fuzz. He couldn't remember where he was
spouse to be traveling. This version of him had experienced
the correct events, but everything changed when
Detective shot Uganka. What was he even doing in this
time? His dreams were puzzling and conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah looked over and saw Joey sleeping. He looked sweet
when he slept. He must of been dreaming she thought.
He fidged in his sleep. She knew that the events that
occurred tonight were not what was planned. That the two
shouldn't be in this time. What would be the
consequences for staying in this time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors ran scans on Detectives brain. They had
never seen this type of metal before. Nothing like it
excised on Earth. They had moved him out of the general
hospital and into a govt hospital for special cases.
here he would have the best care and scientists and
doctors together would find out what the metal was.
NASA became involved with the project. They were able
to extract some of the metal out of Detectives brain
and with the sample create a large abadence. They were
unsure about the uses of the metal - but they knew for
a fact that it was helpful for keeping humans alive.
If it wasn't for the this metal substance Detective
would of died when he was hit by the truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the President became interested in the case. He
visited Detective in hospital and told him about the
great advances in mankind the world would experience
because of Detective nd the metal in his brain.
Detective was finally conscious. He awoke cuffed to the
bed. The room and bed was white. A large 50 inch TV sat
on the bench at the end of his bed. He was connected
with wires. He heard a door open and a woman walked in
wearing a very old styled nurse outfit. 'Perhaps its
a historic dress-up themed party', detective thought to
himself. The woman yelled behind her, 'hes awake'. She
walked towards him. Two doctors followed. They crowded
around the bed where Detective was laying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the Doctors spoke intruding themselves, the
other doctor and the nurse. He explained about the truck
accident and finding the alien metal in Detectives
brain. Detective had no recollection of the events nor
the alien metal found in his brain. It must of been
something that was inserted into new born babies
in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey inserted the USB into the computer. Sarah started
to make her wait down the stairs and to the door. She
would wait for him at the door. Joey browsed the USB
file system. launch was the name of the private key.
There was a second file launch.public - the public
key. The public key was loaded onto the servers on the
ships that were bound for Mars. The private key would
allow connection to the ships. Joey typed a command into
the terminal to corrupt the private key. This would cause
the ships to fail. The real key was replaced with the
fake virus infected key. This would cause the ships to
explode when they take off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the effect of sending Detective back to load 80,000
people with the metal will be stopped once and for all.
Sarah yelled from downstairs for him to hurry up. He
pulled the USB out of the computer and placed it in his
left pants pocket. He reset the computer and rushed
down the stairs to catch up with Sarah. It was pouring
with rain outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa looked over at Joey. He was scribbling notes into
his pad. She had enjoyed this talk. It was more
entertaining than the technical room. She was enjoying
the stories that the business room offered. It was less
to concentrate on and just absorb the information.
The bank talk finished and moved onto questions. Neither
her or Joey asked a question but several others in the
crowd did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slides were all on the same laptop she it meant that
the next talk started 5 minutes after the previous.
The next talk was given by the postal service about how
they are using drones and robots to deliver mail. They
explain how they have replaced the normal postie humans
with robots. They use a GPS data that connects letters
and parcels with where the delivery happens.
They explain how they use machines to scan and sort mail.
They have major depots where the mail is sent then from
there picked up by ground and aerial drones for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as Detective knows that Joey is safe he gets heads to the nearest payphone. He was visual and practiced this so many times that it had
became a habit. Lead the boy to safely, make the phone call to Albumin that he had captured Antony and to visit us. By this time the current
version of himself will be frozen and sent back. If he doesn't contact her, he may never get back to his own time. The phone rings. and again.
Albumin finally answers. Detective explains to her that he had captured Antony and for her to come to the building immediately.
He is careful not to tell her too much information. He had already experienced these events and if he told her the wrong information everything
they had worked towards could be ruined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detectives body dropped to the ground. He had finished
his mission and he had been sent back to his normal
time. The room where he awoke was dark. There was a
man tied up to the chair in front of him. He had no
memory of him and didn't recognize him. The single light
bulb in the room flickered. He looked around to try to
remember where he was. He had been gone for several
years and things might be different in this time line.
He was already experiencing issues with attempting
to remember who this man was in front of him. He stood
up. Suddenly he had a flash. It was of a woman taking
something from him in this room. Did it happen in this
time-line? He thinks to himself.
He walks towards the door. It is a large steel door.
It's closed but unlocked. He walks through the door.
He enters a long hallway which is dimly lit. He
experiences another memory flash. This time of dragging
a body down the hallway. He can't recognize the person
that is helping him with the body - or the body.
Perhaps it's the man tied to the chair? He thinks to
himself.
Detective decides to turn left. He remembers now that
forward would lead him to the building exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning left leads him to the interview room. It's
empty and looks like its been that way for a long time.
The computer here is covered in dust. The window viewing
shows the man - who Detective still cant remember. He
is still tied to the chair. Detective sits on the seat
and turns on the computer. Perhaps this will give him
the answers he needs. The computer turns on successfully
and he opens the camera history. He rewinds the footage
and watches footage of him and another man dragging the
body of the man tied to the chair into the room. He
watches as the man wakes up and Detective enters the
room. He is holding in his hand a remote device. The
man and Detective talk. The man begins to laugh, and
then they both freeze. He fast forwards the footage.
Pauses when someone else enters the room. It's the
woman from the flash. On camera she looks much older
than in the flash. She does a similar action to the
flash. She takes the remote device from Detectives hand.
Someone else is in the room. Detective notices its the
same man that helped him drag the body into the room
earlier. He watches the footage further. The woman
activates the remote device - causing both her and
the man to freeze for several minutes. 'Did she change
something then', Detective thinks to himself.
He needs more answers about what is going on. He reaches
into his pockets to check for anything. Inside his left
pocket is a red USB that label reads: For Detective.
Detective loads it onto the computer. It has a single
video file on it. He opens the video file up with the video and audio player - VLC. It plays security footage of the room where the man in the
chair is currently. Detective is in the scene as well. He's frozen along with the man in the chair. The woman walks into the room. She injects a
needle into Detectives neck. This footage is different to what was recorded Detective notices. The time-stamps match up. One of the tapes must be
a fake or an alternative time-line. Detective watches the footage further. The woman injects the man tied to the chair with another needle. The
footage ends with the caption. 'Find and Save Joey'. Joey... Detective thinks. That's a name that can remember. He can't picture an image of him.
Maybe Joey is the man tied up?
He exits the room and heads towards the exit. He reaches a large steel door. The front entry and exit to the building. The door is locked but
he unlocks it and opens the door. Detective experiences another piercing headache pain and a flash of events. It shows him walking down this
hallway. Someone is standing at the door inside the building. It's someone new. It's not the man tied up to the chair or the man that helped
Detective tie him up. His face is a blur. It's like he doesn't even have a recognizable face. Detective is holding a ray gun. He points it at the
man and fires. The flash ends. Detective is brought back to reality. A ray gun, he wonders. Where do I get a ray gun? He opens the door.
Outside it's dark and raining. The street is a mess. Detective looks up and down the street. It's empty. Two cars are parked in the car-park. He
heads towards them.
The he tries the car on the left. It's a Red Honda. Locked. Perhaps he will have better luck with the other car - otherwise he might need to
smash a window. The other car is unlocked and Detective climbs into the drivers seat. He starts to take off when he experiences another flash.
This time it's outside the building. He's firing his ray gun at the car he is currently driving. One of the ray guns bullets hits a tire.
Detective is brought back to reality when he notices the car suddenly flip. A wheel had been blown. He was firing at his own vechile.
Detective climbs from the flipped vechile. Luckily he wasn't going fast. He heads back to the other car and smashes the window and unlocks the
door. He hot-wires the car and takes off. He really needs to find someone that can help him understand what is happening. It's just too confusing
for him.
As he drives he sees visions of the other car being driven ahead of him. It's like two worlds mixed together he thinks. He decides to follow this
vision car. He doesn't know who could be driving, but it could give him answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day7.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>nanowrimo15-day6</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day6.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The President of the United States addresses the nation and the world. His announcement of successfully sending 80,000 human souls to Mars in order
to preserve mankind. If the events happen as they have been foreseen in the next one thousand years then mankind will be wiped out on Earth and
have to start a new on Mars. The alien metal discovered helps humans breath successfully on Mars. It also helps technology go beyond what we
have today. The time travel possibilities are endless. We are currently looking at sending the metal back further in time - so that we can have
the technology earlier in mankind's existence. Mission launching later today will launch 80,000 human souls into space - destination Mars. It
is unlikely that many of these people will ever return to Earth - instead creating a home on Mars.
Those that return to Earth will be researching into the history of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah sat on the couch watching the television as the President gave his speech. Clutched in her arms was her teddy - Cuddles. He Mother sat by
her side. Sarah was fascinated with the speech. He was standing on a high bench looking down at thousands of people. During the speech the
television cut off to scenes of unconscious people being loaded onto the ships. These people were lucky to be going to a new planet Sarah thought.
Those left on Earth would not survive. Sarah at her age didn't fully understand what would happen to mankind. As she grew older she would learn.
She squeezed her teddy as the first ship launched off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey watched the Presidents speech from the crowd. He had just had his 12th birthday and as a birthday present his parents had brought him here to
watch live the Presidents speech. He knew it was an important day for mankind. Sending 80,000 human souls to Mars in order to survive the events
that would take place. He watched the president as he held up the piece of alien metal that had been discovered several years ago. It was found
inside a man named Detective who had traces of the metal in his brain. Scientists were able to extract the metal from the brain and create copies.
This metal was able to be used to keep humans alive on earth. It also helped our technology development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective stood behind the President. He had a smile on his face as the President mentioned his name and the developments of mankind. His knowledge
of future events allowed humans to prepare to survive. Without Detective being spent back to the past humankind would be wiped out when the event
known as 'explosion on Moon' occurs. The President asks Detective to make a few words. Detective steps forward towards the mic.
'Hello. Some of you may have heard of me, many of you haven't. I was sent back to this time in order to save mankind. The events that are taking
place today will result in Humankind living on past the end of this world and into others. I am privileged to have a hand in making this happen'.
The crowd erupted with clapping. The president moved forward and gave his closing remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey clapped along with the crowd. His Mother and Father side by side. He watched as Detective and the President exited the stage and got into
their vechile, driving off. People chased the car down the road waving and screaming in excitement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the car Detective and the President sat opposite each other. One of the Presidents men were driving. The president had two decutiry guards
beside him. It was unlikely that anyone would dare attach the car. They had Detective with them. His strength and recovery time was far supurial
than any normal human being. The metal that was found in his brain was inserted into all 80,000 humans being sent to Mars in order to help them
live on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead on the road was a road block. The men wore orange shirts in order to be seen by traffic. It seemed like a normal road work. One of the
Presidents guards mentioned that there was not spouse to be any road works along the path. Planners of the route had made sure that there would
be no interruptions to slow down the presidents car.
An explosion ahead of the presidents car sent one of the presidents cars flying. Two van pulled up on either side of the presidents car. 6 men
jumped out of the van. This was a planned attack.
The presidents car took off at high speed - attempting to avoid the debree that the explosion had caused. The six men opened fire with automatic
weapons onto the presidents car. The car was built with a metal that could sustain the bullets but still inside the car the president was worried.
The car made it through the area that the explosion happens. Two of the men had jumped into the car and were hanging on as it speed down the road.
One of the security guards wound down the window and started firing shot - only to receive shots back. Detective had been sitting there calmly
but maybe it was time to show these attackers what he was capable of. He undid his seat-belt and climbed out of the open window - pushing aside the
dead bodies of the security guard and attacker. The terrorist was on the roof and opened fire on Detective. His body absorbed the bullets. He
laughed as he walked closed to the man, disarming him and using the weapon - throwing him off the car. The two van were still chasing the car -
with men inside firing automatic weapons at detective. Detective jumped onto a van and fired inside the van. This caused the van to flip and roll.
Detective went flying to the side of the road. He had experienced some bad luck with traffic accidents.
The presidents car kept traveling ahead. Detective lay and watched as the car traveled into the distance. He couldn't move. His body would need
time to recover.
The presidents car reached an intersection when a car pulled out in front of it - letting off an explosion that caused the presidents car to go
flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarahs Mother returned to the lounge with dinner for her and Sarah. The food was roast duck, potatoes, carrots, and green peas. A blueberry gravy
was squirted over the meat. She sat down next to Sarah and handed Sarah her food.
The two sat and ate their dinner as they watched the President finish his speech and enter his car. An helicopter followed the car as the President
traveled to the space launch. The two watched in horror was the presidents car was attacked. Detective or 'the man from the future', as many called
him saved the president from the attacked. They were saddened to see Detective being knocked to the ground after the first van exploded. The
helicopter camera followed the presidents car. When the car entered an interception there was another explosion - this time causing the presidents
car to roll. 'This isn't a good day for him', spoke Sarahs Mother. Sarah said nothing, she had been ignoring most of what was on television -
focused instead on her food. She loved Duck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey heard an explosion in the distance. People were panicking. He looked around for his parents but they were gone. 'MUM. DAD', he yelled. He
was frightened. Why would they take off like this he thought to himself. A mans hand grabbed him. He looked similar to the man that had just
spoken on stage. 'Come with me if you want to live', the man spoke. 'MUM', he yelled again as this man dragged him towards the exit. Joey goes
with the man. 'He cant be a bad man if he helps the President', he thinks to himself. The mean leads him out of the area. Shortly after he
hears an explosion behind him. The blast had came from the area he was just standing in. If it wasn't for the man leading him out of the area,
he might of been hurt, or worse - killed' Joey thinks to himself. He can no longer feel the mans hand grasping his arm. He looks around but the
man is gone. Then he remembers about his parents. He begins to head back to where the explosion came from. Police have cornered off the area
and he is unable to get back through the barricades. A second later he hears another explosion - this time further up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prep the space crafts. Load the passengers. Genders and Races are split evenly between crafts. 50% gender split. Range of professions and ages.
People are picked randomly and put through a screen tester. Time Split device is tested on individuals and anyone immune is refused travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police dragged Vanessa outside and placed her into the back of a patrol car. Students watched as they took off towards to the police station.
Once at the station they grabbed her out of the police car and took her inside the police building for processing. She refused to speak until
her Mother arrived. One of the officers phoned her Mother to get her to collect her. The police had received a tip off that she was planning an
attack on the school, therefore they intervened early and arrested her. No evidence was found for this so they decided to release her to her
Mother. It made the police force look bad when incidents like this happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albumin pulled up outside the police station. Her daughter was being held there on suspected terrorism charges. Albumin knew the chargers were
false and that it was just Antony messing with their lives. She walked inside and went up to the counter. 'I am here to collect my daughter,
Vanessa May', she spoke. The woman behind the counter looked up. 'Can I have your full name, date of birth and address', the woman asks. Albumin
gives her the details. A police officer walks out of the door and asks Albumin to follow him. They walk back through the door her just entered
and down a hallway. The two enter a room where Vanessa is being held. 'No charges were laid but we have to act on information when we receive it',
the police officer apologized. Albumin gave him a dirty look and took Vanessa's hand and marched her out of the building.
Once in the car Vanessa spoke. 'This is your fault Mum', she said. 'If it wasn't for you banning these people we wouldn't have all these issues'.
Albumin sighed. 'I am sorry love', she replied. 'We are working on repairing the problems'. The two then took off in the car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day6.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>nanowrimo15-day5</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day5.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detective awoke from the sound of a door slamming. He moved quickly and retrieved his ray gun from beside the bed. He heard people talking in the
kitchen. 'Was it the police, the home owners, or someone else breaking in?', he thought to himself. He moved out of the bedroom and towards the
kitchen, careful to not not be noticed. He peaked around the corner. To his surprise the very people he had been after stood in the kitchen.
Sarah, Joey and an unknown robot who he didn't recognize stood there.
His headache got worse, and he dropped to the ground in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micheal pulled up outside his exwifes home. Normally she is waiting outside her home for the lift to work. He tooted twice. No response.
'What could she be doing', he thought. It was very strange of her not to let him know if she wasn't going to work.
He turned off the car and climbed out - locking the car after him. He walked up to the front door and knocked twice. No response. He reached
for his cellphone and tried the home line. He could hear it ring inside but no response. He tried her cellphone. It range and she answered.
'Hello Micheal', she spoke. 'Hi, Where are you?', he replied. 'I am at your door waiting for you'. There was a pause. 'Are you there?', he
asked again. 'Oh yes, I'm waiting outside my place like normal', she answered. Micheal looked around and there was no sign of her. 'Is
this a joke', he asked angrily. 'No no, I am here'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albumin stood outside waiting for her exhausted Micheal to arrive to pick her up from work. He was running late, it wasn't like him to
to run late. She looked down the street to see she could spot his vehchile. No sign. She heard her home phone inside ring and rushed inside
to answer it. She was too late, the caller had hanged up. She went back out the front. A minute later her cellphone rang and she answered it.
It was Micheal. Apparently he was waiting for her outside her home. Waiting where she was currently standing. She had returned home yesterday
afternoon from Uganka and the issue of Detective and Antony. Perhaps those events mucked up time and she was displaced.
She hanged the the phone up and decided to return to Uganka to see if he had made any progress on locating Detective or Antony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their bodies were still frozen. Detective was holding the time split device. Uganka noticed blood running down the forehead of Detective.
'That cant be good', he thought. Reaching for his cellphone he dialed Albumin. She answered. 'Hey, we have a problem here. Detective
seems to be bleeding from the forehead', he told her. 'Yeah, that's really not good', she replied. 'I will be there soon'. Albumin hanged
up the call and dialed another number. 'taxi please', she spoke. Outside she noticed the taxi pull up. She made her way out the front door, locking
it behind her. 'Where to?', the driver asked. She gave the address where Uganka, Detective, and Antony were. The taxi took off. Shortly later they
arrived at the building. She thanked the driver as she exited the vechile. She knocked at the door Uganka let her in and they both walked into the
interview room. The bleeding from Detectives forehead had gotten worse. Uganka had been using cloths to wipe the blood.
Albumin took the time split device from Detectives hand. She examined the device. 'Do you know how this works', She asked Uganka.
'No idea', Uganka replied. Albumin fiddled with the device. The fiddling caused Albumin and Uganka to freeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uganka heard a knock at the door. He answered it. Standing there was Detective with an unconscious body. 'Help me get him in', spoke Detective.
Uganka took one end of the body and they both lifted it into the building. They dragged the body into the interview room. 'Whats his name',
asked Uganka. 'Antony', replied Detective. They strapped Antony's body to a chair in the room and exited the room. They both stepped out the door
and moved to the watching room. Here they both took a seat in the watching room. This allowed them to monitor Antony for when he awoke. Uganka
was tired and began falling off the sleep as they sat there. He switched on the monitor and opened a terminal. The terminal monitored the building
and alerted of any activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6b345 sat up on the bench. 'We are on Mars?', Joey said in amazement. Walking over to the building he knew something wasn't quite right with
the planet. 'How am I surviving? The air feel like it does on earth', he asks. 'We have developed the air so it is possible for humans to survive
on this planet, after Earth was destroyed Humans needed a new planet to survive on', 6b345 explains. 'Earth is destroyed', Joey gulped. 'Yes,
over 1000 years ago there was an event on Earths Moon that caused Earth to be unlivable to humans', 6b345 explained what happened.
'So is there other humans on this planet', Joey asked. 'There should be, by my calculations I have been offline for 5 years, so events may of
changed, but last time I checked humans were thriving on Mars', 6b345 replied. How exciting Joey thought to himself. Humans surviving on Mars.
'You must take me to these surviving humans', Joey said. 'Very well, but it will be a long journey from here, we are going to need transport'.
6b345 stood up and started walking out the door. 'How are we going to find transport?', Joey ask. 'I will be your transport', replied 6b345.
To Joeys amazement 6b345 transformed into a hovercraft. 'Get on', 6b345 spoke. Joey mounted 6b345 and the two took off into the dusty distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah grew up in a small town. It was like any other. Her house was down the block from her primary school. That's where she first discovered
her love of computers. There wasn't allot to do in this town. It had a supermarket, a library, and a small skate park. There were only two
schools - a primary school and a high school. They were only down the street from each other. The streets were clean and houses neat. At
night people stayed inside and the streets were empty. Crime was low. Everyone knew each other.
When Sarah was her first year of school the school got its first ArtControl AI robot. They used it in the art class to help students with
their drawing and painting skills. It was able to create demos that the students learn by copying the demo. After the success of it in the
art classes they purchased more for other subjects - to mimic behaviors. The code running the system was open source so it meant anyone could
contribute to the software.
Sarah remembers the day that her art class opened the artcontrol machine. It was an exciting day, the whole school wanted to be there. Twelve
students, the art teacher and producible gathered around the long plastic wrapped package. The students were allowed together to unwrap. They
pulled back the plastic bubble wrap and undid the cords. The ArtControl Machine lay there lifeless. It needed turned over and the reset button
pushed in order to start's. Sarah was given the honors of powering on the machine. It's eyes blinks green twice and started to make a whirling
sound. The students crowded around as it announced its names and duties. '2g987, art demo and tutor', it spoke. It had the default voice but
the voice was able to be changed to a range of different voices. Its hands could hold a pencil, pen, paintbrush, or palette knife in either
hand. It was possible to mix and match the art tools.
The children were excited to see 2g987 produce its first artwork. They had setup an easel and wooden board for the first painting. 2g987
asks what they would like painted. There are a range of answers - create an original piece from memory reference, draw from life, or a combo
of both. The students decided on a original piece from memory reference. The next option was the style of the painting. Again this was a range
of choices to choose from. There was a range of artists they could choose from - old masters such as Willem Kalf, Canaletto and Leonardo da Vinci.
The range was limitless. 2g987 also had the ability to scan a painting or drawing and produce an original work in a similar style. The students
choice Leonardo da Vinci. 2g987 got to work straight away - first sketching in pencil, then applying a gray-scale layer, and finally colour.
The students steered and watched in amazement at how quick 2g987 worked. Within a few minutes the painting was finished. 2g987 stood back. It
seemed proud of this first painting.
The bell rung and the students all ran from the room. Sarah stayed and examined 2b987. She brought her hand up and touched it's fake plastic face.
It smiled. It's green eyes blinking 3 times. It was the first of its kind to be used in classrooms. Future versions of it would take over the whole
classroom, including the students. Engineering the perfect education resource machine. That's what it was about. Creating the perfect machine to
create open resources. It had a Creative Commons logo tattooed to its arm. CC BY 4.0. It read. The meta data that it created was stored online as
part of an API. Everything the machine saw and did was documented. It's about creating whatever you consider a education resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArtControl walked down the street. He held in his left hand a Wacom pen and on his right arm a Wacom drawing tablet. Sitting on this tablet was
a Raspberry Pi computer. This had a monitor attached to it. It was being powered by a USB. Attached to the Raspberry Pi was a power pack, and the
Wacom tablet. When the new oxygen was developed to keep humans alive on mars they used a chemical melted down to allow wireless charging. The
Raspberry Pi was being charged with oxygen out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet connection was everywhere. The speeds were 10gb a second download and 1gb upload. Their was an unlimited amount of usage. The Pi was
being developed to include a wireless card. Older version of the Pi didn't have a wireless card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony sipped his cup of herb tea. It was hot so he placed it on the counter to cool down. Sarah sat in the chair.
Blitz, Antonys Abyssinian cat entered the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day5.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>nanowrimo15-day4</title><link>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day4.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detective held the time split device in his right hand. He watched Antony as he squirmed in his seat. Suddenly Antony stopped squirming and began
laughing historirocy.
Alarm bells sounded which blocked out the sound of Antony's laughter. 'What is this', shouted Detective. 'You will never find me', yelled back
Antony. The alarm stopped. Everything stopped. Both Antony and Dective froze. For a moment in time, the world stopped. Then everything went
back to normal except for Antony and Dective. They stayed frozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony awoke in a dusty hut. He had no memory of how he got here. The last thing he remembers is being tired up to a chair and having Detective
talking to him. 'How did I get away', he thought to himself. He looked around the hut to get an idea for where he is. In the corner of the room
lay-ed an old artcontrol robot body. It looked like a prototype edition from over 50 years ago. 'I wonder if it will still work', Antony thought.
He moved towards the robot to examine it closer. The series number on the machine said 6b345. He turned it over, noticing that the battery
was fried. 'Maybe I could repair it'. He dragged the robot outside the hut. Outside it was raining. The view was like nothing he had seen before.
Bright purple colour rose from the distance. The waves crashed onto the beach. Antony continued to drag the robot along the beach. In the distance
he noticed an old industrial building that may have the tools to repair this robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reached the building. The door was a large steel door. Antony tried the door and it opened up. He dragged the robots body inside the building.
He was happy to get out of the rain. The building was large. He could hear the rain on the tin roof. Old tools scatted the ground. Tables and
chairs were broken. Antony dragged the robot towards a table and sat down. It was an effort moving the robot. He searched around for anything
that he could use to repair the robot. Sure enough he found a battery pack that he was able use use. He used a screwdriver to remove the old
fried pack and inserted the new pack. The front light switched on - turning green. The robot began to make a whizzing sound as it powered up.
'Mission Sarah Rescue Complete', he spoke in its robotic voice. Antony smiled with amazement as it started to move. It stood up and started to
move forward. It didn't seem to notice Antony. 'Hey You', spoke Antony. 'Command Now', the robot spoke. 'I am 6b345, what is your command'.
'Where are we', Antony spoke. 'You are on planet Mars, it is the year 3532, month June, day 34', 6b345 answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans fully colonized the planet Mars after a disaster happened on Earth which wiped all living species. Before the disaster hit they had
a supply of humans preserved on Mars that were active in order to maintain human existence.
The biggest problems they had with life on Mars is the lack of oxygen. They did have problems with supply but have since setup enough of a base
on mars to supply without the help from Earth.
Plans were made for humans to travel back to Earth in order to retrieve important items. Earth was unlivable but the humans were able to spend
a short time on the planet in order to get the items. The time split device had been left on Earth and it was important to retrieve it. Humans
would never be able to survive for long on Mars and they needed to change events in order to stop the moon from splitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey stood and watched as they went over to the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey is sent to Mars when the time split happens. What happens to Detective when the time split happens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective awakes in a green grass field. He had never experienced anything so beautiful in life. His whole life the world had been gray and black.
The sun was shinning. 'Was this even Earth', he thought. He had heard tales of an ancient earth where the world hadn't been destroyed.
Before the ArtControl machines took over. In the distance her saw a building which looked like a shopping complex.
Crowds of people were walking in and out of the building. A road ran down the side where people were driving cars.
Dective had never seen these kind of cars before, he had seen photos of them when he was a child. The cars had four wheels and required a
driver to manually control. Dective headed towards the road. Maybe someone could help him, he thought. He reached the road and started to cross
the road. He crossed in front of a truck, which hit him and sent his body flying. The truck sketched to a halt. People crowded around his body.
Detective was barely alive but an ambulance sirens were in the distance heading towards the scene.
Two ambulance pulled up and jumped from the vechile. The asked everyone to move back from the body before examining it.
They moved the body onto a stretcher and took it towards the hospital.
There was a chance that the man would survive. The ambulance flashed their lights and sirens as they rushed towards the hospital.
They pulled up outside the building hospital and rushed the stretcher and body inside emergency.
The mans  body was heavy damaged, beyond what a normal human being would need to survive.
As the doctors examined the patient they discovered a metal like substance in the patiats brain. It was used to control his actions, and keep him alive. They had never experienced anything like it before. On of the doctors had a contact at NASA that researched alien life forms.
The doctor made contact with them in case they were able to shred some light on the issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah was chosen along with Joey and 6b345 to go back to Earth in order to find the devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah ship circled the Earth. She had lost communication with Earth after the explosion of the Moon. It would of caused a ripple effect that
knocked the Earth out of orbit, killing all lifeforms. She had a backup plan of traveling to Mars where she would be able to activate the
80,000 humans that were stored on the planet. On the computer she put in cord's for Mars and her ship took off at light-speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several minutes later she found herself circling the red planet of Mars. She had only ever been to Mars when she was little with her family.
Humans had been creating a colony for years on the planet and had made a base that was able to sustain human life.
It was a rough ride as her ship entered Mars atmosphere. She landed on the docking station. After landing she exited her ship. She was able to
take off her spacesuit as the base had oxygen that allowed humans to breath. The air was thinner than what she was use to on earth and it took
her several minutes of breathing to adjust.
She heard a notice from inside her ship. 'Was someone else on my ship', she thought to herself. She reached for her ray gun and boarded the
ship to investigate the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6b345 checked his co-ords. The Lang and long were off. The system searched for the cord's and returned that they were on Mars - not Earth.
This could be a problem. He started to move his ways off the ship when they heard the ships door open and Sarah board the ship again.
She was equipped with a ray gun. She must of heard something when   6b345 was moving around the ship. There was no where for him to hide.
Instead raised hands and stood still waiting for her to enter the supply room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah peaked around the corner into the supply room. She had spotted what what making the noise. It was a robot with it's hands up.
'How the hell did you get on this ship', Sarah spoke as she moved around the corner - Ray gun pointed at the robot. 'There is nothing
to worry about', the Robot spoke. 'I am 6b345 and here to help you. I boarded the ship when you were on the Moon'. Sarah lowered
her Ray gun. 'A friendly robot, that's rare', she replied. 'I am Sarah, pleased to meet you', Sarah said as she held out her hand to
shake 6b345s hand. They shock and then exited the plane together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'My calculations estimate that there is enough oxygen to last for the future', 6b345 tells Sarah. They both make their way down the platform.
Ahead of them is a large steel door. They move forward. 6b345 hesitates. 'You are not a scary cat', Sarah laughs. 'No, I'm just picking up
some unusual readings', replies 6b345. 'Are you sure this place is safe?'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uganka stood at the door waiting for the knock. It was important that Sarah and Joey arrived on time. They had gone to retrieve a private key
that would allow the time split device to activate. It was very experimental and hadn't been tested before. Uganka was about to give up when
he head a knock. 'Who's there', he spoke. 'Sarah and Joey Macfurson', a female voice spoke. It must of been Sarah thought Uganka. He started to
unlock the door when behind him he heard footsteps. He turned around to find a solid man pointing a ray gun at him. The man fired the gun knocking
Uganka to the ground.
Outside Sarah and Joey heard a gun shot. They backed away from the door. 'This cant be right', spoke Sarah. 'Something has changed, he was meant
to answer that door and let us in'. 'Lets get out of here', suggested Joey as they turned around and started to run down the road. They found an
abandoned car which they were able to hot-wire. Joey was in the drivers seat and Sarah in the passenger. An old artcontrol robot model was lying
across the back seat. Joey reversed up and took off. They watched as a man stepped out of the door and started firing on them. Joey slammed on
the alzarater and speed down the road - avoiding the burning car parts in the way. 'What the hell happened there', asked Joey. 'We are spouse to be
inside that building'. Sarah shrugged. She was just as confused as Joey.
The two continued driving down the road. The rain had gotten heavier. Sarah moved to the back of the car to examine the artcontrol robot.
'What kind of condition is he in', asked Joey. Sarah flipped the robot over and checked his battery pack. 'It seems fine, just needs a reset',
Sarah replied. She reached for the reset button and pushed it in for 3 seconds. The robot started to power up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective stood over the dead body of Uganka. One ray gun blast to the chest had killed him. He moved towards the door and started to unlock it.
He heard a car starting up outside. He stepped outside with armed with his ray gun. He fired three times at the car but missed and the car was too
far away now. Detective had stopped Sarah and Joey from entering the building. How this would change the future he was not sure, but having them
enter the building would be devastating. He needed to hunt them down and kill them.
His head hurt from the headaches. Since the accident his body hadn't been the same. He had some of the best doctors and scientists repair him. His
hand reached for his pills in his pockets. He swallowed two down. These pills helped keep him alive.
Devtive made his way down the street and found an old car that he was able to hot-wire and start. The car was full of rubbish, old soft-drink bottles
and food. He started to drive down the road in the same direction that Sarah and Joey had traveled.
He traveled several blocked before giving up. He wasn't going to find them in a city this big. He could sleep in one of these old apartment
buildings and in the morning hunt for them. He pulled the car over and made his way over to a building. The building was clearly empty - wooden
planks covered the windows and door. He searched for something that would allow him to break the door down. He found a piece of steel nearby that
he used to smash the door. He entered. The lights switched on. It looked like the people that lived here left in a hurry. Lunch was served on the
table. Fly's swarmed the food. He moved towards the kitchen. The fruit in the fruit painter was still good. He ate a banana and headed towards
the master bedroom. The bed was made and had fresh sheets. He climbed into the bed and feel asleep. He was excused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://wcmckee.com/writersdenhamilton/posts/nanowrimo15-day4.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
