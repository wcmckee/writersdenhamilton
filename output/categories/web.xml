DevMob is short for Developers Mobile. This was my first
unconference that I attended - there was no official&lt;/p&gt;

Unexpected indentation.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
schedule but it was created before hand and during the event by those attending. Google spreadsheets were used for this. Sessions were given by&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;tt class="docutils"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, line 4)&lt;/p&gt;
Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the organized by time slots. Time slots were strictly enforced but anyone attending the conference could run a session.
Tickets to the event was 100 or so dollars with a 20% discount for students. Those that volunteered were able to attend for free. The event was a
two day event so I think it was resemble priced. I was able to attend for free as I signed up to volunteer. I wanted to do AV and record talks.
The talks were not recorded due to mostly that the topics that people were discussing could be sensitive and they wouldn't want it uploaded to the
internet. Next year if I attend DevMob again I will look at recording one of the streams - if people are going to be talking about sensitive topics
then they should not have their talk in that stream.
Instead of recording talks like I usually do at Linux/Python Conferences I spent the majority of my volunteer duties washing glasses. This may sound
lame but I quite enjoyed it - plus I got to hang out with some cool people when doing so.
The majority of the sessions I attended were in the Kai room - near the kitchen. This was a mobile developers conference - united all platforms of
mobile - ios, android, windows, html5 and even blackberry (lol). The majority of the talks on day 1 were focused on ios with a call on day 2 for
more android talks. There were a couple of Microsoft employers attending who gave a session on Windows phone.
I attempted to run a session called 'Towards a new website Creative Commons'. Maybe the title was too general because only myself and another volunteer
showed up. I thought Tanya a Creative Commons volunteer would show up but she was too tired. Another volunteer would of showed up to it but she was
stuck on the front desk with regisation. I discussed Creative Commons a little with the other volunteer - he had heard about it via Wikipedia, then
decided to cancel the session. I headed down stairs and sat near the kitchen with my head on the table - resting. I felt quite crap but I got over
it after awhile.
The location of the event was Hoobsenville Point Secondary School - one of the newest schools in the country. It is one of the newest schools in
the country. It was built in 2013 and opened in 2014. I didn't get to explore the whole school (others were using areas of the school during the
weekend also). The areas we were in were large open spaces. There were also smaller break off rooms. It felt like something out of a Valve office.
Rooms had large televisions mounted on wheels and apple tvs attached (meh to the apple tvs, i would do raspberry pi computers if it was up to me).
For DevMob chromecast was also connected to many of the monitors so people could stream android content. The appletv/chrome cast setup worked
excellent and there was little to no technique issues over the two days.
I had my Raspberry Pi with me connected to my small portable screen and Wacom tablet. Many were interested in the setup and I have gotten good at
explaining it. A small room was used as a hackers room where people did more hardware type of stuff. This was really only on the second day. Android
Auto was demoed along with head gear to control computers with your eyes. I setup my Raspberry Pi up in here to give people the chance to have a
play. This was successful and was better than running a proper session.
Overall i really enjoyed DevMob and would do it again next year - perhaps being more involved leading up to it with web and graphics work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>article</category><category>conference</category><category>web</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/devmob15-reflection.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>nzdevmob2015</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nzdevmob2015.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekend it will volunteer at nzdevmob2015. It's being held in Auckland. Volunteering was the only option. Of course specifically - audio and
video. They called it in early to help setup with displays. It plans to be in a room where there are regular speakers. A room where it is focused on
quality talks - with slides. It has no idea about the video and audio setup they have. Perhaps in the morning check the internet for previous
conference videos. Even if it comes down to it - records audio on iphone. Hopefully place has decent mics and a camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time that it has attended this conference. It's a barcamp. un-conference. Create the sessions yourself. Given rooms, timeslots,
freedom to do what you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand - Ideas for a new website. How to find volunteers and allow them to micromanage. Champion volunteers within
volunteers. One of the great things about this conference is the people attending get to run the sessions. I would love to see one that explores
volunteers in small organizations and how they can scale and micromanage. Matt replied to my comment on a new ccanz site. I've suggested to move
away from php/wordpress and towards either a python powered framework or a static site - maybe a combo of both. See how this weekend plays out but
I'll be interested in a session to discuss and brainstorm ccanz site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be staying at Kirsty and Eriks on Thursday and Friday. It's my birthday on Friday. I've been asked to help setup at nzdevmob2015. I'm
looking forward to seeing the setup that they have. It should be quite good - they have been doing this for enough years. They are using Slack
for coms. It's the first time that I will use Slack but it seems very simple. It's like IRC but you have the option to pay for it, as well as it
seems more simple. I'm looking forward to all the free swag. It's been sometime since I've been to a Microsoft sponsored conference - global
game jam would of been the last one - and that was a game jam. Before that it might have been Hack Auckland - which was years ago now.
Other sponsors include TradeMe,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month I wrote a novel. It was called It Will Not Be Mine and was in the Science Fiction genre. The total wordcount was at 53,050 words. Each
section of the book is split into daily writing sections. There is no chapters or structure - just what I felt like writing that day. I've certainly
kept to a theme and worked on creating a story. I started to edit the novel towards the end of November. The 28th was the final day I wrote anything
of substance. On the 29th and 30th of November I wrote: 'hello' and 'world'. When editing I started with day1. It had a high word count for the first
day and allot of summery type writing, along with the ideas that others at NaNoWriMo meet up in Waikato had given me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meet ups in November in Hamilton were on every Wednesday morning. I got along to several of these. Sadly it was a bad time - 10am in the morning
so the majority of people were at school or work. I think if you are going to have meet ups during the week it's best to have them at a bar, bookstore,
or library. In Wellington they had weekly NaNoWriMo Wednesday meet ups at a bar. I didn't get a chance to attend one of these but talking to those
in Wellington they sounded popular.
Waikato also had a meet up on Saturdays. This was hosted by Lisa at her workplace. This was for only 2 hours. Like during the week not many people
showed up which was a disappointment. On each of the days of this event we only had three people in total in the weekends. The first weekend was
popular - 9 or so people. They found this in Wellington also - lots at the launch party but they drop off quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After writing for a whole month everyday i felt a bit empty and unknown what to do with myself. I had gained a habit of writing the novel everyday.
It was basically my life for a whole month. There was not much else that I did or was interested in. From when I woke up in the morning till getting
a boost on that days word count before I fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped editing the novel. I'm not even going to look at it till Jan 2016. Once Jan hits I'd like to edit it. There are plenty of spelling and
grammar errors that need fixed. It's currently a rough draft. Much of the novel I haven't even read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>article</category><category>conference</category><category>web</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nzdevmob2015.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
