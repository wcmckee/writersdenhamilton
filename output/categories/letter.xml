It's the first time I
have given it a go in this month - previously I have only written a novel in
November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper fed Carrot his cat biscuits. He as very hungry that morning. He
hadn't been fed since the previous morning. Pepper had put Carrot on a diet
as she was told that he was getting fat. Carrot was not impressed by this as
he thinks he is a skinny cat. He does not like it when people think he is
fat. Carrot is a long pussy cat. Stretching out over the carpet. His front
two legs are way out in front of his head. The back legs are stretched back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn a few scratches on the pi tft is annoying. Makes it not look so cool.
What can you do about it though? Buy a new monitor? Not worth it yet. I would
rather just use it scratched for now. Might buy a new one in the future with
How did it get the scratches in the screen anyway? Monitor banging against
the wacom pad and keyboard. From falling over onto stuff. General wear and
tear. Need to work on this script for keeping track of word count and files.
Would like more backup things as part of it. Read online that it was not
possible to auto save in nano. Are there alternatives to nano that is simple and
allow auto save?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright I have switched text editors. No longer am I using nano but instead I am using gedit. It has an auto-save built in and word wrapping. The text is a little smaller than the terminal but it works. This is fine. I can tab every 15 minutes of writing and check what my word count is up to. Maybe display word count inside geddit. Anyway got to get going with the word count today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper was excited to win the potions contest. The money she won from it would go towards her training as a witch. She was told by her Godmothers that she was to be the next True Witch of Chaosah. She was the last of her bloodline for this left. It was important for her Godmothers that Pepper take the training seriously and not joke around. There is nothing more than Pepper likes more than joking around and having a good time. She does still take her studies seriously though. Carrot slept beside Pepper as she held the feather pen and drew. Cumin was prancing around the room, looking busy. She had told Pepper that they would continue potions training today, that the holidays were over. Pepper had a great holiday. She had a sleepover at one
of the witches she met at the potions contest and they had played board games late into the night. The witch lived in a giant old castle. It was flash compared to Peppers home. But Pepper liked her place and would not want to live anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumin realised that there was no Dragons Teeth left and asked Cayenne and Thyme if they would go and get some. They declines as it was late in the day. The two witches were happy
around the fireplace. Thyme painted her toenails and had no intention of leaving anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't take long to get a decent amount written. This editor is fine. It's very minimal but has a few more settings than nano that is needed - especially auto save. I have word wrap turned on also so when I reach the end of the screen it moves down to the next line. This is helpful as it means I do not have to hit enter so much. The only thing I might improve is the colour theme. I would like a blue background and dark red text. Similar to my painting. Though with painting a blue background hasn't been used for sometime - it's been plain white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Komora City. Market day. The streets of Komona were busy with sellers and buyers. Amongst them were a figure that wore a light coloured witches hat with a dark band going around the hat. Attached to her back was a broom. Her dark hair poked out the back of the hat. She wore a dark purple coat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Good morning Sir, I would like eight pumpkinstars, please", Pepper asked the shop keeper. The animal had a bald head with very circular ears and a red earring. His nose and mouth was shaped like a muzzle of a dogs. He must have been a mixture of animal and human as his hands were human-like.
"Here you are, that's 60Ko", the shopkeeper handed the pumpkinstars to Pepper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"...Oh dear", Pepper spoke. She emptied the coins from her purse. There was certainly less than 60Ko.
"Uhh sorry, I'll have to take only four..." Pepper apologised to the shop keeper. He looked her angrily and removed two of the Pumpkinstar from the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as they completed their exchange a voice could be heard beside Pepper, "Greeting, good Sir. Please prepare two dozen of everything for me. .Premium quality, as usual. It was a blonde witch. She wore a purple hat and matching outfit. In her hand she held a stack of coins - enough to buyout the shop.
"It's always a pleasure to serve you, Miss Saffron" the shopkeeper greeted her. His mood had switched an an angry mood with the sale with Pepper to a happy mood as he knew Saffron was always a big spender.
Saffron noticed Pepper. "Hey look, it's Pepper" she remarked. Pepper didn't say anything just looked at Saffron annoyed. "Oh. let me guess business is booming in the countryside?", Saffron asked sarcastically.
"I guess your preparing the ingredients for tomorrow's potion challenge", Saffron asked. Pepper finally
spoke. "A potions challenge? Tomorrow?. Pepper left she had enough of Saffron and her bad attitude.
Pepper had found the letter about the potions challenge. It read: Komona Potion Challenge 50,000ko grand prize FOR THE BEST POTION On Azarday, 3 Pinkmoon Grand Plaza of Komona.
Pepper was excited. "Lucky me, I still have a full day to prepare! Let's win this challenge", she yelled in confidence from her broomstick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she arrived home Carrot was there to greet her. He waved, happy that Pepper was home. Pepper studied through a stack of books for ideas for the potion. "Oh! I know", she clicked her finger and a smile rose on her face. "That's exactly what I need!", Carrot opened one of his eyes. He had been trying to sleep when Pepper was reading but now she had woken him with her chatter. Carrot knew what was coming next. "CARROT!", Peppers voice boomed. "Get ready, we'll hunt the ingredients together". Carrot knew he wouldn't be able to sleep anymore. He had to wake and go with Pepper. It would be fine once they started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once loaded on Peppers broomstick the two were ready to leave. Carrot held a large net. the two had rope tired around their waste. The sky was dark but lightning lit up the sky. Heavy black clouds filled the night sky. "First, I need a few pearls of mist from those black clouds", Pepper told Carrot. He knew know what the net was for. It was going to be Carrots job to capture the pearls from the clouds. Tough work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next the two had to go he the haunted jungle for red berries. This was not fun for Carrot who got tangled in a spiders web and was attacked by spiders. The next area to visit was for egg shells from the Phoenix valley of the volcanoes. The heat here was too much for Carrot and he sweated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next ingredient was a drop of milk from a young DragonCow. This giant flying beast had wings and a body like a dragon but a light colour and dark spots and facial features of that of a cow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back home the evening was growing late. The sky was a purple and pink colour and the clouds a bright orange. The sun was setting. It gave Peppers home a gloomy purple look. Inside the home Pepper was busy prepping the potion that she had just gathered the ingredients for. Pepper sat down and tested the potion she made. "mmm. Best. Coffee. Ever", she spoke. Taking another sip of the hot drink she had made. Carrot couldn't take it anymore. All afternoon they had been out to collect ingredients for Peppers potion and it as all for just a coffee. Carrot fell over tired and slept. Pepper was happy with her coffee. "It's everything I'll need to work all night long and make the best potion for tomorrow's challenge".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper spent the night putting together the potion. Finally she came up with the Genius Potion. A potion that makes anyone super smart that consumes it. Pepper got Carrot to test it. It didn't work so Pepper threw it out the window. A group of any came into contact with the potion, causing them to learn advance maths. In the end Pepper ended up falling asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She awoke in the morning in her bed being flown (by her broom)
to the city of komona. Carrot had prepared fresh clothes and her witches hat. Pepper fell asleep before making another potion. Carrot had prepared a potion for Pepper. It was Carrots urine from a recent vet visit. Pepper was annoyed. she knew she would not win with the potion. What would she do? There were three other
witches entering the competition. Including Saffron who she had met at the Komona markets. The other two witches seemed friendlier. The fair skinned girl was quiet and shy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wow this is almost the word count for today done. 1667 is the word count daily goal for November. But it is cooler to just say 1666. Number of the
devil/Satan. Devout holy novel. litrate. Pepper and Saffron fight over love of the Prince. Both want to marry him. Basically hit my word count for today. Would like to get more done today. It's almost 1100. Beautiful blue sky with white clouds. Slight breeze. Might wear jacket. Take pi and walk. Draw. Sit and do drawing studies of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Writers Den Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An opportunity for writers to develop skills, confidence, and network. Sharing and supporting of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortnightly at the Hamilton Central Library, Kathleen Glenn room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5:30pm to 7:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper sat outside her favourite cafe, eating a camera slice and drinking a hot chocolate. Her witch's hat was perched on the back of a chair. Peppers dark hair blew in the wind. A small child walked past. Eyes were fixed on Pepper. The gentle nature of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whats the next web comic that am i going to write about. I see there were several new posts added to the fan art section of the pepper and carrot site. There was one drawing by a New Zealander which was neat. zomg this is not going to work testing one two. Going to check what the word count will be running at today. Today will be the third cafe that I have been to in 3days. All different. At each one I ordered a hot chocolate and a cameral slice. They were all delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death thought it was ironic that he was sitting at Heavens Bakery. It was true that Death didn't choose sides. He served both the  heavens and hells. He felt more attached to Hell. Following Death where ever he went was Hades. The souls that Death removed from the Earths were tossed into Hades then processed to either heaven or hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blue sky was still visable but much of it had  been covered with clouds. Dark gray clouds were forming in the centre. Walking here there was several drops of water. But nothing to worry about much. Wondering to stay here for awhile more then walk home or walk into the city. If I walk into the city I'm worried it's going to rain but if I stay here don't get out as much. There is always tomorrow. That will be the final day to get out. Been busy in the past few days by getting out. Important as don't come here often. This place is nice and it's just good to get away to somewhere you usually don't come. Once there was a secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper can type very fast on her keyboard and doesn't even need to look at any of the keys. How many keys per minutes are you typing. I think they mean characters per minutes. How quick to reach 50,000 words do I need to type? Average out five thousand words every two days. It would take ten days to reach 50,000 words if 5,000 words were typed every.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council of Ah made several magic houses sign a peace treaty. Both Aquah and Magmah after much debate signed the treaty. This brought peace to the world of Hevena. The majority of magic houses were neutral but it had been hard for several of houses. Great shortages of food and health supplies had lead some of the houses to lend aid. Peacekeepers were also sent into hot areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was the first day of Peppers witch school training. For the next 6 years she would live in his home and learn under the direction of Chaosah witches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my birthday and I invited the witches that I competed against at the Potions Contest. Sadly none of them showed up and I was forced to summon demons into Hevena which had the party with me. There were three demons that I summoned. Two which looked similar, one green and hairy. The other was purple and had bigger muscles. Those two demons were both male. The final and third demon was a female spider-like demon. They were friendly demons and enjoyed the party. It was very lowkey. They had cake and tea. The spider demon was a fan of drinking tea - she drank over 20 cups during the evening. She was a friendly spider demon and Pepper had a great time chatting to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Hevena is teaming together to bring you a service and API to help with writing your novels this month. Everyone here will be writing 50,000 words. If you fail you will die. It will be painful. There is no reason why you can can't write. It's just words on a page. The words can be basic and full of mistakes. The important thing is to sit down everyday and write some words. Set a minimal target of words per day. Writing software and apis to help with wordcount. Keeps tracks of the hours and clients. Auto billing. For version control it uses Git. Does commit every 100 or so words. Spell check before commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find most common words in file. Then finds gifs based off the words. Nginx is able to serve billions of requests
per second. Serving only static files. html, css, markdown, rst, txt, png file types. Sites are powered by Nikola a static site generator. Content is licensed under a Creative Commons Attubutation 4.0 International licence unless specified otherwise. Copyright and the evils. Journal subscriptions - access to knowledge - becomes "fiscally unsustainable" to the richest university on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper is an art student. She found some artwork online that she wants to download, print out, and use in her art project. She isn't sure who created the artwork or what that artist might think of her using their work. Does she take a copy? Or look for something else? It can be hard to know. Artists and creators have a problem. Copyright law is getting in the way of realising the potential of the internet in creating and promoting their work.
"Why is this" spoke Pepper. "What digital copyright culture should we work towards to best support the arts?".
The Witch took a drink of water before continuing, "Copyright is a form of intellectual property that is granted by law automatically upon creation of a work. It prevents people other than the creator from kaing copies of (inc luding adapting, sharing or performing) that work without the creator's express permission. It is unregistered - unlike patents or trademarks, you don't have to apply for it. Don't need to use the copyright symbol. Copyright lasts for life of the creator plus fifty years, copyright then expires and the work enters the public domains". Pepper spoke clearly. Switching through the slides as she talked. Once she started talking she was no l77longer nervous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I choose because I like that Attribution-ShareAlike licence gives others the freedom to be able to use my work in any way they wish to, but only if they then allow others to use that work in the same way. By including the ShareAlike restriction in the licence, if someone wishes to use my work commercially then they must open up their own work. This is a positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper lay on her couch with her orb computer sitting on a table in front of her. Using a Bluetooth keyboard she typed the novel. Carrot lay on her legs. He wanted loves from Pepper but she shooed him away, wanting to focus on her novel. She has never edited any of the novels she had written in the past. The first time she entering the writing contest was November 2014. Pepper wrote a science fiction story. It was never long enough to be called a novel, but it was a start. The story followed several characters and places they work and the advancement on automatics matters such as food creation and delivery. In 2015 Pepper was a winner of the contest. She managed to write just over 50,000 words during that month. The room was boiling and was hard for Pepper to focus on her writing. She had made her goal for the dat but had written enough and she had. It had been a record few days for her. It is about learning when you have done enough and giving it a rest for the day. It is too hot though trying to think about getting up and going outside. Need to check how much of the battery is left. It is likely not huge. Of course there is a script to run every 60 seconds that prints the information about the file. The script checks to see the most recent edited file in the writersdenhamilton posts folder. This is where Pepper writes her novels. They are saved in here and shared. Pepper allows people to share, remix and adapt her novels. They are licensed under the very free CC BY. Isn't this wonderful for everyone! When writing the novel Pepper was able to get inspiration from a range of sources - public domain and creative common licensed works. This script could be used by anyone who write files. If care about looking at most recent file changed, the word count, and the most recent word. Had confided getting top 5 words and looking for gifs on them. ignore boring 1 or 2 letter words. Filter the top words. Novel generation. How much of that writing can be taken changed and remixed, and then added back to the novel. When does it get repetitive? Does it make for a decent book? Does it even make it faster. Need to save and check words count. It must be getting high now! Very good. The word count is even more today than yesterday. Need to build some software in April to do with writing. Make graphs out of word count data and content data. In all the novels/short stories what is the most common words that are longer than 2?  That is the question and we need an answer. I am very happy with the setup. Need something to protect the pi and the screen. concerned that its getting damaged when I transport. Would like easy way to put it in bag. Wrap it in protective plastic? I'm not sure but whatever you do, fix it before the screen cracks more. It's a expensive screen and you need to take care of it. Getting tired and should stop this and go and read. Need to perform the git stuff before I get off it. Can keep the pi running all night since it is plugged into the wall. Usually only run it  from the battery pack and have to keep them rotating over. Pi3 is sitting at another place. Looking forward to getting it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>letter</category><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/campnanowrimo-day02.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2016 02:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>campnanowrimo16-day01</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/campnanowrimo-day01.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Saffron,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the letter. It's been too long so splendid to hear from you.
You certainly have been keeping yourself
busy these past few months. Will you show me
some of this new magic? The stuff that is created from the orbs.
Carrot is good, but always very hungry. I think he is missing your cat. Those
two would play together like best buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What more to tell you. Cumin has been teaching me potions. Last week she got
me to get 'Dragons  Teeth'. I thought she meant REAL dragon teeth but she
meant the plant. Have you used the plant in any potions? Anyway I have quite
a few dragons teeth here that I don't know what do with. Do you have any idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of my training I had to scare a human. Everything was going fine till
I entered the room they were sleeping in. omg, you would not believe it.
The most cutest, handsome prince. Our lips were about to touch when BANG he
turned into Thyme. Dammmmnnnnn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went on holiday to a island. It was very chill. just lay on the beach with
Carrot and siped juice. Man there was this giant fish that swollowed the two
of us up. We were stuck in this fishes stomach. Carrot came up with a good
idea and scratched the fishes insides with his long, sharp claws. This caused
the fish to vomit us up. Not the most fun day lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other night me and Carrot followed Thyme going to that cave again. She
was  using that glowing orb. After she left me and Carrot turned it on. I
won't tell you what displayed but it was embrassing lol. I figured it out and
switched it to a endless runner unicorn game. You remember the one you showed
me. The game crashed or something. It must of trigged an alarm or something
because the next minute a giant spider was there to help getting the orb
fixed. He showed us where their server room is. Super cool, next time you
are here I will take you and show you the setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How have your classes been going? Cayenne is teaching me spells. I don't
think shes doing a very good job at it. Maybe if&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway looking forward to your reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;love,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pepper (and Carrot x)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Pepper,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the return letter. I have been busy with my witch training so
slow to reply. I will teach you some of the magic I have been learning.  It's
mostly stuff to do with earth elements. Quite  different to the demon summoning
that you are mostly into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've heard it's posible to bury dragons teeth and sketeton warriors would
rise from the grave. Sounds like something that the people over at Zombiah
would be interested in. Have you talked to them about uses for the dragons
teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's funny about the cave. What was it that Thyme was looking at? I once
caught one of the workers at the orphanage looking at something they shouldn't
of. blah blah blah goes the letter. Those spiders sound cool. I'm looking
forward to meeting them. Were they affected by the genius potion like the
ant were? They sound smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to hear that Carrot is going well. It's important that he's having
fun. Make sure to feed him only once a day! Any more and he will get fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spiders wrote a script that performed analize of the most recent file
the author is working on. It looks for files that are changed with the
file type rst. Of course this could be set to anything. It also gets the
most recent word at the end of the file.
Auto retrieved what the user has typed. Keylog the file basically. User
doesn't need to save - it saves keystrokes every one minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikola builds the file if changes have been made. If no changes have been
made do not build. Creates new rst file for the day. When the clock hits
midnight create new file. Close old file, open new file. Spell check file.
commit. push. Tweet the last 100 characters, or tweets the keylogger  story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes Saffron evil? She is a manapiftic person that uses others for her
own gain. Thinks little of others. Cruel nature. Like Pepper Saffron is also
an orphan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did Pepper and Saffron become orphans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only witch in the group that has parents is Zombiah. She is spoied by her
father the king. City currently ruled by him but will be pasted to the girl.
After awile they thought nothing of it. People were fighting and killing to
become king. There once was a witch that lived in a shoe. There was an old
lady that lived in a shoe. That's how its going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a new assignment I thought you might to give it a go also. As part of
digital citizenship paper that I have. It's really fun. Basically you about
copyright and the law. They teach you this stuff called Creative Commmons.
I like to think about it as a hack on copyright. What Creative Commons offers
is licences that copyright owners can apply to their work that gives permission
in advance for use of the material. All rights reserved. Some rights
reserved. No rights reserved. Public domain work falls under the no rights
reserved. If something is in the public domain then it's free game to do what
you want with the material.
It's good and well to learn about creative commons but really you need to
apply it. Find a work that is licenced under creative commons or public
domain and share, remix, adapt into something new. Be brave and licence
the something new under a free licence. Once in a while there tests a person.
That this script is working correctly. Everything they do is monitored.
Every keystroke on their devices. Spoken words are analized and compared to
criminal databases. The sirens don't shut up they just keep blasting and blasting.
It's a civil emergeny and the sirens have been blasting for hours. There was
an attack on the city by Aquah. They unleashed their most heavy forces. The
cities walls did not hold. Magmah archers attacked from a distance. Swordmen
attacked enemy forces breaking through, or climbing up the wall. Enemy had
ladders that they used to climb the walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you ever wonder what it was like to fight in the war? All those souls
that were lost. They never really discovered what started it. But it was
something between Aquah and Magmah houses. Do you have any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you think of my digital citizenship project? For it I have decided
to write a novel. It's based off the web comic Pepper and Carrot. Merge in
public domain and other creative commons stuff. Write stories out of Jems
comics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I entered this potion contest there were 3 other witches that entered the
contest. The first made a dead bird come alive. She was from the Zombiah
school so typical spell. The next was a girl called Saffron. She made the
undead bird posh. It had a fancy hairdo and handbag. Ah was too frightened
to use her potion but Saffron snatched it from the girl and tossed it on
the undead posh bird. This potion caused the bird to become huge. It was out
of control. Lucky I saw able to scare the bird off with my potion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I have gotten the last of todays word count done I can go and have fun.
I will reward myself. The sun sat to the east. The sound of yelling and screaming
was fading. It had been a day of killing. Tomorrow will be a day of mourning.
Too many souls were killed today on the battlefield. They will be missed by
their wives, mothers, fathers, siblings and children. A roar of thunder could
be heard through the plains. The dark night sky flashed with lightning.
Rain hailed upon the heads of the men. The woman far away in their homeland.
This was the year 1805 and follows the Russians as they faught in wars.
Red coats vs blue coats.  Red is Russia. Blue is France. Prince is captured
by enemy and exchanged for a deal. The deal that the exchance happened is
in lock up and only a few select have seen the deal. It was said to be a peace
treaty between the two houses but the details were never revealed. The council
were accused of withholding important information by not revealing the deatils
of the deal. Spys have been sent to break in to the information and release
the information. The info can't be harmful now as it is outdated and any
information on it. It is said someone within the agency leaked the details
then escaped the company. They didn't hide the fact that they released the
details, but they didn't want to be the face of it. There was public outcry
over the release of the details. From both sides. Those who supported the
witch in releasing the detail - it's for the public good. Transparency of
public agencies. against - harmful to troops. Allowed to spy and watch
everything people do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She siped her bottle of Isaac's Cider Original, typing the beginning of her
novel. It was a young adults novel and the word count goal was 50,000.
Challange to do stuff hasn't done alot in past with novel - first person.
Follow the story though the eyes of a fourteen year old witch in training
called Pepper and her ginger cat - Carrot. Sitting there Carrot purred. He
was a happy pussy cat. For the first day wrote letter from Pepper to Saffron
and a return letter from Saffron. It was really just a warmup and I'm not
sure what to make of anything. I guess just don't worry and look for new
content to include. Get better of not saving and checking wordcount so much
just spending more time only writing. It's getting dark and cold out there.
Soon it will be time to go inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pepper went and attempted to get Dragons Teeth from a range of dragons -
fire, air, swamp. This was a fail and instead opened up a service of removing
dragons teeth for free. This lead to her having a large stock of dragons teeth
due to not needed dragons teeth to begin with. Pepper had gotten it mixed up.
It was the plant dragons tooth that Cumin needed not real dragons teeth.
Pepper had written to several of her friends and asked them what to do with
all these dragons teeth. It was fill of lots of chit-chat but the dragons
teeth questions were most important. Pepper had recieved word that one of the
best things to do war burry them in her garden and skeleton warriors would
rise. She thought this was a great idea by Saffron so did just that. She
found the dragons teeth that were most healthy looking and buried it in her
garden amongst all her vegetables and herbs. Pepper belived you should only
grow what has a use. Food was good to grow as she could make delicious
breakfast, lunch, and dinners out of the food produced. Currently the garden
caters for %100 of the kitchens needs. Pepper needs not visit the market.
She is slective on foods she grows and seeks expert witch advice on the
matter. If you don't do something right. Do it again. The black bird flew
in the sky. The bright blue background behind it. The bird moved in and out of
the Gray clouds. It knew there was going to be a storm still and it needed to
get home to it's family. It was too late and the family of the bird perished
in the storm. The bird was sad and didn't know what to do. One day it was
flying past the majors office in Komana when it dropped to the ground, dead.
It had suffered a heart attack. The major found the dead bird and decided
to use it in the contest the very next day. The bird is still alive -
the giant undead-posh bird. Very much alive. Pepper chased it away from Kormano
but it was quite happy to leave and found a new home. It was able to settle
down with a family. It lived a very jolly life. The tree branches bent in the
wind. Maybe Pepper needs to go and sleep soon I think she has done enough word
for tonight. This is a good start for tomorrow. What will happy tomorrow? This
is very much of a pantster project. Sure its being based off the pepper and
carrot web comic. Ideas have been developing. Before this file there are
another 12 based on Pepper Carrot stuff. They are unedited, first drafts for
a novel. When it finally comes to editing the three novels together there
needs to be a wealth of content to draw from. Of course there is going to be
three novels. There has to be three. Not going to focus on the magic heavly.
more litery than fantasy.
The spiders were really interesting. One of them wore glasses. They sat at the
end of his nose. His face looking at the orb in front of him. It was flashing
brightly. 1. 2. 3. Drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have drawn you a picture that I drew recently when I was on holiday. I had
my Portable Pi Digital Artist Wordstation. Complete with the offical
touch screen from Pi Foundation, Wacom drawing tablet and pen, and a Raspberry
Pi 2b computer. All this was being powered by the cased battery pack. The Pi,
monitor and drawing tablet were attached to the right arm. There was a place
to secure the pen also. Was able to draw by holding the pen with left arm and
draw with the Wacom tablet, able to see what is being created on the touch
screen. Art created is moved to a folder where a blog post is generated.
Reflect on the artwork. Give updates to how drawing is going. For example
switching from a3 to a4 and reducing brush size 20px to 10px. Switch to larger
16 gig SD card. Need to format current sd card. Plug in new 16gig sd card and
pi3. Need to find a screwdriver that would do this for. When I save it need
to keep typing for another minute or so. After which how the hell can someone
get 50,000 words in the first day. You must start at midnight and just go all
night. Stopping only for food and toilet. No sleep and before the clock
stricks midnight hit 50,000 words. How many words is that per minute? Get a
generater to generate a book with social trends. Twitter trends are prompts.
Likely lots about american politics and war. Anyway I wouldn't mind some
prompts. They could be helpful to get me through some of the slower days. Today
certainly isn't one of those days!
It's hard to know when to stop really. It's very peaceful out here to get
stuff done.  Currently only Carrot is here distracting me. I'm sitting on my
chair typing on the keyboard. He jumps up on the table and walks around the
table - very carefully. Each paw touchs the  same spot as he strives around
in a cirle like a model walking out on stage. catwalk.  Getting tired and cold
out here and want to go read War and Peace. It is a long read. Currently 30%
through the book. Enjoying it. Nice mix of romance and action. Well thoughtout
and exacuted. This is not going to add more points to your score but it will
help by the time you get to the next day. Still push yourself and get that
goal done quickly. How quick this time can you hit 50,000. Last time you did
it finished with several days free to write more and nothing on two days. Was
sick of writing. Have been writing quite a bit in March - warmup. Will hit
goal then might get sick of it. See how it goes. The incests are biting my
angles. It hurts and is annoying. This makes me want to go inside. I don't
even know what the time is and have no way of finding out unless I go inside.
Need to go toilet. The lemon trees need it.
The light shone behind the armchair. The old man sat in the chair His eyes
fixed on the television. A game of rugby was being streamed to his monitor.
It was 24 hours of unique spots matches. All live. Able to time switch if
it if you want. It was almost half time and the old man would have supper
during the break. In his younger days this was a beer and a bucket of potatoes.
The Irish was rich in his blood. Never meet the old-old man. Stories told about
him and like to tell stories about him. Write a novel about irish coming to
new zealand.  Fleeing the church. 'Work' trip to nz. No money so shovel fuel
for trip. Also has to clean and cook. Has workers/staff dorm. Food and
bunked bed room.
Pepper ordred a home that she could put together herself. The majority of it
was printed with her 3d printer. They are cheap and it's common for homes
to have multiply 3d printers. The old man sat with his glass of juice and
chewing his choclate chip cookies. They had just been cooled from freshly
baked in the oven. The choclate chips were large and gooey. His dog was
stretched down in front of him. The fireplace had die out but the warm heat
still kept the room cosey.
wow and pepper didn't even copy anything from a novel today. Fun doing sketches
of same buildings as i did few years ago. Back then had sketchbook wide and
clutch pencil. Sat in same seats as last time. This time have pi. Problems
with eyes. Feel the need to close one and things arnt clear. For closeup
take glasses off and read. The text is more clear with my glasses off. Can
read the smallest type from a distance. Would like to read from a greater
distance naturally without glasses. Will my vision ever be perfect for distance?
The old man missed the 2nd half of the sport. He got himself distracted in
the kitchen. What was he making at this hour. The scores had changed in the
sports match and the team that was losing is now ahead. This made the old
man grumple. The dog had moved now. It was lying on the couch.
"Cats and Dogs can sleep on grass but what they really want is a couch", said
the old man.
"love me, love me, say that you love me", the music playing out of the
televion. The music was playing on everyones cellphone. zombie rugby player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>letter</category><category>novel</category><category>peppercarrot</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/campnanowrimo-day01.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2016 02:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
