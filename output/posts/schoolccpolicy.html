<p>Definitions of Intellectual Property
In this policy - intellectual property includes the rights to all created work.
Outputs are the products that are created by an individual or group of individuals. This may include for example artworks.
Outcomes are the consequences or results arising from the development of, or use of IP other than products that are created from IP.
Examples may include a publication such as a book, web site or, an exhibition.
Ownership of IP and outputs arising from intellectual activity
In general all IP and the outputs and outcomes arising from that IP are owned by the creator. While Albany Senior High School will derive benefits
from the outcomes; there are exceptions to this, as follows:</p>
<p>Outputs and IP created by staff in the course of their employment are owned by the school unless otherwise expressly agreed by way of contractual
obligations in an employment agreement.
Outputs and IP will be jointly owned by the school and a staff member only where such joint ownership is expressly agreed between ASHS and the
staff member.</p>
<p>Clarity of Licensing</p>
<p>All published works should be clearly labelled using the appropriate symbol from the Creative Commons icon set.</p>
<p>Disputes</p>
<p>Where there is a dispute over ownership, including co-ownership of IP, and/or the commercialisation of any co-owned IP, the following process will
apply:</p>
<p>In the first instance the dispute should be documented and presented to the school Principal.
If the dispute is still not resolved then the documentation should be presented to the chairman of the Board of Trustees.
Mediation with an appropriate authority will be undertaken if the dispute cannot be resolved by the Principal and / or the Chairman of the Board.</p>
<p>Approved</p>
