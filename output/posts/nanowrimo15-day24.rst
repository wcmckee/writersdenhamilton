Vanessa walked into the room. Detectives skin was normal. In some of the visions Vanessa was experiencing of him his skin was
red and infected. To find out what was going to happen next. Vanessa moved up to Detective. He looked suprised, happy to see
Vanessa. She began to undo the straps around him, and get him out. Her plan for when he was out was to travel back to Mars with
Detective. She had no idea what happened to Antony. He had disapeared from the ship. Vanessa thought that maybe Detective had
gone back and changed events. She wanted to review the tapes and see if there were any differences between the two. 
Vanessa worked quickly  searching through the tabes to findf out what changed. They had been keeping records and live updates 
of a range of timelines. She drank a coffee from her left hand and typed with the other. Her words per minute were impressive.
She was top of her classes. Her Mother and Father were both very proud of her. What she was searching for was any information 
that will lead her to find out what hppaned with Detective when he was sent back. She had been researching newspapers reporting 
strange events that he could be involved in. One interesting moment Vanessa found was when the humans of Earth sent 80,000 humans
to Mars. She was able to retrieve articles from several timelines and noticed difference in the events that occured. 

Vanessa and Detective landed the ship on Mars. A large group were waiting for them to arrive - including Detectives parents. They
were releaved to see him - believing that he was dead and gone forever. Vanessa needed to interview Detective to find out some 
of the events that she was not sure about. They wanted to analze Detectives body to try to find out what Antony injected into his
system. Vanessa walked into the lab. Detective was seated on a seat,
no cuffs this time. Vanessa had the results for Detectives brain and
body scans. After the two returned to Mars they decidied to study what
Detective had happened to him. They started from the lounge - when
Detective was eating eggs and watching the television and went into a
fit, killing him. Antony bursts into the room, grabs detective and
heads to space with a ship. Antony liked classical music and would
always have music playing when he flew ships. Public Domain but he
used Creative Commons BY as well. After this test it worked
successfuly. Antony was happy that a experiement finally worked. After
a large change in the wordcount the software was finally working. 

There was no sign of Antony. Vanessa rewatched the security footage that showed Antony disapeared when Detective actives the 
time split device. A similar event had happened with Detecive when he was traveling - he found a copy of himself and injected himself
with a substance - causing the copy body to disapear. 
6b345 was a great help in working out what happened to Antony. 6b345 had been with Antony shortly after it arrived on Mars. Before
that 6b345 spent time with Sarah. Originally the machine was designed to be a open education resource creater for the education
sector before being moved to the space program. 6b345 had always perfered to be in the education secton and felt a little uneasy
when the govt moved it to the space program. It compilied with the requests. It was given a full militery upgrade for the transfer.
The work in space was far more dangerous than working in the classrooms. It was a normal day for 6b345 when the security breach
happened. He had no idea when it happened. Just suddenly he lost control of his actions and thoughts - someone else controlling
his system. He was unable to send an emergency call back to Earth that his system had been taken over. Whoever had taken over his
system had disabled the ability for him to send the messages. 
6b345 was powerless. He idly sat by and watched his body destory the other research bots with him. They didn't fire back at him.
It happened too quick. Whoever that was controlling him, knew what they were doing. After the other bots were dead the explosives
were set. When control is given back to 6b345 the memory of the seacurity breach is removed. 6b345 returns to normal when Sarah
arrives on the Moon, following her off the Moon. 6b345 had managed to
stay hidden from Sarah untill they arived on Mars. It was here 6b345
lead Sarah into the trap if Antony.

Joey arrives on Mars through time split device. He finds 6b345 and
puts him back together. The time that Joey is in is after Detective is
returned to Mars after being sent back in time with Antony. Joeys time
on Mars is the present timeline. Everything else is behind. There can
be no future past Joeys timeline. They thought he was special because
it is something that he does that causes the device to stop working at
that time. 

What happens to ItWillBeMine when she leaves the cars in the robot dominated timeline? She glitches and is sent to to this line.
She had already been killed and wasn't spose to be there. After escaping the car she hunts down Loth'Rak who has recently landed
on Earth. She is lead to believe that he may be able to help her. ItWillBeMine locates Loth'Rake who is tied up in a building. She 
breaks in and get him out, avoiding the robotic troops. No one ever finds out exactly what happens to Antony after he disapears from
the ship. Vanessa had visions of him breaking through from other timelines but she believes that he no longer excists here and is 
unable to get back completely. She is happy as he is dangerous and would likely create more monsterous creatures like himself and 
Blitz. Antony was always a big fan of Blitz. The Humans on Mars created a statue of Antony that had him patting his cat Blitz. 
'Antony - the monster that never exsisted', the stone read. Many came to view the statue and learn more about Antony and the
developments that had happened around them. Even though he was considered by most to be evil and sinister there were good parts of
him aswell. Some even sided with him - beliveing if he didn't kill Sarah then mankind wouldn't survive on Mars. Many people were
split into two group, argueing about the issue. It was hard to pinpoint excacpty what happened.
The events will be remembed in history. It was a very stange period of time. Nothing quite like it had happened before, and nothing
was ever going to happen again. Generations afterwards studies the events. It was taught in school, in univercitys. Professers
continued to write papers on the events, spinning new perspectives on how events happened. Detective was the final of them all to
die. It wasn't long after he returned to Mars. His genes had became corrupt leading to a spread amoung the humans on mars. Vanessa
didn't relize this until it was too late. Antonys plan all along was to get Detective back to Mars. Vanessa had fooled for it.
That's why he wasn't on the ship. Antony had timed it so that he would be erased from this timeline and apear in another. Vanessa
wouldn't suspect anything when Antony wasn't on the ship. 


Sarah moved towards the transport pod. She was several hundrad meters out from it. She took long strides in her space suit,
staying focus on the target. Even though this was only training she wanted to score top marks for the pratice mission. Others would
be completing a similar training mission to her and the ones with top marks will complete the real mission. She had been preparing
for this training for years and now it was finally happening. Sarah
had reached the transport. She watched in the distance an explosion
happen. The transport that she had just climbed into went flying. All
around her the explosives erupted. Sarah had arrived on the Earths
Moon on a bad day. The simulation was blowing up the Moon and training
astronautes to travel to the Mars if something ever happens. The
Humans knew it was going to happy so they decided to prep for it. By
doing so ment that they forced the event to happen, because they were
so obsessed with it going to happen - it happened. If they had ignored
it, forgot about it - it may not have been so bad. Each time it got
worse and worse. They had always encourged people to prep for the
future. For the worse. People were buying small transport pods that
would get them off the Earth should the attack happen. It drove
everyone insane until it happened. Sometimes there is a

The holidays they decleared were March 16 Sarah, June 24 Antony. Every
year on these days people would gather at the statues of these
historic beings. They were going to be remembered long after they are
gone. The whole period of time was going to be remembered. It was only
a matter of time before a winner arose. That winnder was Sarah. Her
parents were there on the day she was announced the winner. That she
would be the one sento to the Earths Moon for the mission. She had a
series of goals to complete. She had been training for years and was
going to be successfully complete her Moon mission. Sarah couldn't
wait to leave and staying on Earth was making her not able to sleep
correctly. She woke multipy times in the night. After the doctors
checked her they told her that she may be unsuitable to go on the Moon
mission of she was going to be going on this mission then her health
needed to improve. Sarah got back on track and preped for launch. She
was in top health when she takes off from Earth to the Moon. It is a
solo mission that she is on and it's going to be tested now. Her
Mother and Father were there the day her ship launched to the
Moon. 'Whats new pussy cat', was playing on the over head speakers. It
brought a smile to Sarahs face as she climbed inside the ship. 

It was not good when Antony was sad. He would go into rages and trash the room he was in. Druming his arms against the floor. This
was more rage than sadness. There were several moments when Antony
went into these rages. Once was when he found out about his Father. It
caused to major distress and burnt down his home. When he was creating
his experiements he went into a rage several times. The first was when
The Bee failed. It caused him to burn down the lab and he had to build
a new one. He regreated burning down the lab as it costed him alot of
time. All his research was backed up so he didn't lose that. He
believed it was important that the science is able to be
reproduced. He had starting sharing his results online. 'Antony
creates a friend', was the name of the blog where he wrote daily posts
and uploaded the formulas. Antonys guide to zombie creation 101. He
had maintained it, updating it with journal notes daily, photographs
of setups and results. He wanted to show everyone else that what he
was doing was posible and everyone else could do it as well. There was
nothing stopping them from doing a better job than what he was
creating. On an afternoon after the site went live his webserver
almost overloaded from requests. People were obsessed with his videos
that he was producing and the content that was being made. All the
files were in text format. This made it easy for people to do what
