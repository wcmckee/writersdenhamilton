William Mckee is an artist, 
web/software/videogame developer, writer, 
public speaker, photographer, and 
videographer.

He is a volunteer for Creative Commons NZ
helping to promote Creative Commons in both 
his day to day life and through organisions 
he is involved with - artcontrol, Writers 
Den Hamilton, Hamilton Computer Club, 
Hamilton Library. Everything he creates 
is licenced under a Creative Commons license,
with preference for the more libral, and 
open culture licences - CC BY and CC BY SA.

His art can be found at 
`<http://artcontrol.me/>`_ and is 
available under a Creative Commons 
Attribution (BY) licence. 
William is also a supporter and user of 
open source software, and is passionate 
about early childhood education.

"I use Creative Commons as an artist in 
the hope that it helps promote my artwork, 
and to make the world a better place," says 
William. "Others may find uses for my art 
and even make money from it, good on them!"

During High School William spent the majority
of his senior years in the Design words. He
spent the majority of his time creating vector
designs. 

William seriously became interested in 
drawing after leaving high school and 
attending UCOL in Palmerston North. 
There he had a drawing tutor, Mark, 
who inspired him to keep a drawing journal. 
William gained the habit of carrying a 
sketchbook wherever 
he goes, along with a pencil or pen.

William created the site artcontrol.me: 
The Art Of William Mckee.

The site was created for a home for William 
to host his artwork.

Originally powered by WordPress, he has since
switched to the Python static website 
generator
 
It was hosted with GoDaddy and ran CentOS. The site was powered by WordPress, 
switching later to Nikola. 
He later also switched this to DigitalOcean 
with the operating system Debian, which is 
used by the majority of his machines.

While William was always interested in using 
a Creative Commons licence, he at first 
chose to use a more restrictive 
Attribution-NonCommercial (BY-NC) licence 
for his artworks, though soon chose to use 
the liberal Attribution (BY) licence. 
William doesn't see many reasons for artists 
to use NC licences, and finds it especially 
problematic when NC licensing is used by 
governments.

As William argues, "Tax payers have already 
paid for the material. It should therefore be licensed under the most liberal licences 
(perhaps even public domain/creativecommons 
zero). This allows the most freedom for 
people to do what they like with the content."

William also point out that the 
"Non-Commercial licences are hard to 
interpret, as was noted in a German court 
case in 2014, which strongly limited the 
interpretation of NC to 'personal use.' 
Similar problems with the interpretation 
of NC could exist in other countries. 
This is why I think everyone should avoid 
the NC licence. I would actually prefer that 
the NC licence not exist in the first place."

The good thing, Williams says, is that the 
majority of New Zealand government works 
released under CC seems to be under CC BY, 
though he is concerned that some schools 
seem to have adopted an NC licence.

In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended 
The Learning Connexion, where he began to 
focus on life drawing. This was created on 
brown paper with an easel. Pencil, coloured 
pencil, oil pastel, acrylic paint, gouche, 
watercolours were the media that he used.

William had done digital painting since 
attending UCOL with illustration classes.
He used a Wacon tablet. Currently for his 
digital painting William uses an Intous 5
small tablet connected to a Raspberry Pi 
computer. The software he uses is GIMP 2.8 
and it is running the operating system 
Rasbian (Debian Jessie, Stable). William uses
a batery pack plugged into the Pi to power it.

William uses the Pi to edit text. Plugging 
in a keyboard and uses terminal with the 
softwarenano to edit text.  

Digial later focused on portraits

using GIMP, an free and open source 
raster graphics software. William began by 
painting on a windows desktop and laptop, 
later switching to Fedora and Debian. 

Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait 
and figures were drawn from references on 
RedditGetsDrawn. During this period, 
William would draw portraits of people and 
give them the drawing - taking a photo for 
his own reference. 
At the bottom of the page he would sign 
with wcmckee artcontrol.me and write 'cc by' 
on the piece of original artwork. 
These were mostly completely in pencil 
and coloured pencil.

William is also passionate about working 
with children. In 2014 he volunteered at 
Whaihanga Early Learning Centre, 
where he would work collaboratively with 
kids, often on the same piece of art, 
using oil pastel, pencil, and coloured 
pencil. 
He was influenced by the children's artwork 
- often redrawing elements of their works.

William took the liberty of licensing these 
works under a CC BY licence - photographing 
and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me. 
He would create large chalk murals on the 
ground outside, with children requested that 
he draw comic book characters like the Hulk, 
Spiderman, Bane, and Batman. These mural 
pieces were created on the fenceline of 
Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School. 
Swarms of school children would crowd the 
fenceline - watching and discussing the 
artwork with him. They were often blown away 
from how quickly he worked.

"A hope of mine," William says, 
"was the children would learn that art was 
about sharing and remixing - something 
Creative Commons has at its core."

William has since become a volunteer for 
Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, 
helping to spread the word about 
Creative Commons licensing in 
the Hamilton region.
