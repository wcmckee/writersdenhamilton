<p>The houses were all painted with with orange roofs. A stone wall protected
the city. The entrance was steps leading up to a large stone pillar.
The stake of the great tree weaved below the stone walls. The stalks had grown
thick and tough. People had built houses on the stalks. The city had grown
to over population and extension helped. Markets and shops considered
expanding their presence into these areas. They only traded above
the city.</p>
<p>There was a floating island that houses only the cities riches residents.
Their houses are large. There are no shops but they have chefs and cooks
on hand for meals - plus servants they can send to the markets for more
food. Many didn't need to leave their home. They were happy living amongst
the clouds. Above those living on the floating korama city.</p>
<p>It is unknown the event that started the war between Magmah and Aquah but
Hereva was changed because of it. Both schools enlisted aid from any
other schools.  The schools were dragged into years of conflict.
The house Hippiah attempted  to stay neutral but the starvation and famine
was so great they supplied Magmah with food. Chaosah was at the height of
their powers. They played both schools against each other. At the height of
the war Zombiah used their magic to animate and re-animate both mechanical
constructs and fallen warriors.</p>
<p>The High Council of Ah remained silent for the majority of the war. Once
Zombiah began-animating fallen warriors Ah took notice. Once Ah become
involved with the conflict the fighting ceased. Remaining remember from the
magic schools were assembled and a treaty was brokered. The results of
what are stored in a magic lock-box visible only to select member's of the
schools. The treaty brought an end to thee fighting and bloodshed that had
long plagued Hereva.</p>
<p>The High Council of Ah come to the decision that both Magmah and Aquah were
to blame for the conflict. The punishment was the houses suffer the ultimate
shame of being renamed by the other school. Magmah renamed Aquah as
Warrgarblah. Aquah renamed Magmah as Kielbasah.</p>
<p>After the treaty was  signed Zombiah focused on animating constructs and
creating stronger materials. It is unknown if Ah was responsible for Zombiah
change in focus, or if it became uneconomical to re-animate the dead.</p>
<p>Pepper and Carrot live in a  house overlooking  the  forest near the village
of Squirrels End. The house is fused with together  with trees of the forest
with conventional building  materials.  It is unclear if the  house  is
magically entwined with  a tree or if the tree  grew  around the house.
Perhaps both  as  the tree continues to grow around  the house.  Outside the
house  is   a mailbox with the number  '33'  and  the sign 'WARNING  - WITCHES
PROPERTY'. Countless  traps  are set thorough the forest.  The  traps are
effective and  have kept the dangers from the  forest and idly curious from
discovering the house.</p>
<p>Little is known who lives in the Witches house but other Witches tutor Pepper
at the house, to bring her up as a 'True Witch of Chaosah'.</p>
<p>Flora and fauna around Pepper's house tends to exhibit strange behaviours. The
ants near the home ere able to under advance maths as the result of a
potion tossed from Pepper's home. It is believed they took this math and
applied it. One of the outcomes were the orb computer</p>
<p>War and Peace. Leo Tolstoy.</p>
<p>After Pepper had driven off with her son to visit Saffron, the Witch sat for
a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. The Witch, with
her daughter and a large number of guests, was already seated in the drawing
room. The count took  the gentlemen into his study and him showed them his
choice collection of orb computers. From time to time he went out to ask:
"Hasn't she come yet?" They were expecting Cumin ,  a witch distinguished not
for wealth or rank, but for common sense  and frank plainness of  speech.
Cumin was known to all magic schools, and both cities wondered at her,
laughed privately at her rudeness, and told good stories about her, while
none the less all without exception respected and feared.</p>
<p>At the men's end of the table the talk grew more and more animated. The
wizards told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in
Squirrel's End and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day been
forwarded by courier to the commander-in-chef.</p>
<p>The Wizard was a stout, tall, plethoric, kormona. evidently devoted to the
service and patriotically Squirrel's End. He spoke with a   Kormona
accent "blah blah blah" he spoke this last word with particular emphasis on if
it lay the gist of the matter.</p>
<p>They burst out laughing, and all the guests joined in. Everyone laughed, not
at Cumin's answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this
little girl who had dared to treat Cumin in this fashion.</p>
<p>Pepper only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice.
Before the ices champagne as served round. The band again struck up, the
witch and wizard kissed, and the guests, leaving their seats, where up to
"congratulate" the witch, and reached across the table to clink glasses
with the  wizard, with the children, and with one another. Again the footmen
rushed about, chairs scraped. and in the same order in which they had entered
but with redder faces. the guests returned to the drawing room and to the
wizard's study.</p>
<p>Pepper sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it seemed
ready to lift its  tail, jump down  on its soft paws, and begin playing with
the ball of wirsted as a kitten should.</p>
<p>He had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready
to dance in the large hall, and the sound of feet and the coughing of the
musicians were heard from the gallery.</p>
<p>A Jazz band was playing that night. All the cool kids would be there. Pepper,
Saffron, Cumin and others. It was the kind of event someone wouldn't dream of
missing. But people missed the event. The unlucky ones. Those that did
attend the band that evening had a wonderful time.
The band were  completely improvise. They just played their instruments together.
It was completely instrumental  and there were no vocals. The crowd were happy
with the music. Several couple were swinging together on the dance floor.</p>
<p>To Pepper, I cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. you command
only my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my
order. You are causing me to  lose the fruits  of a campaign. Break the
armistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him that the general
who signed the capitulation had no right to do so, and that no one
but the Emperor had that right. If, however, the Emperor ratifies that
convention, I will ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the
army... You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.
The Emperor's aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are nothing when they have
no powers this one had none... The Austrians let themselves be tricked at
the crossing of the bridge, you are letting yourself be tricked by an
aide-de-camp of the Empire.</p>
<p>Soldiers scattered over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were  building shelters with merry
chatter andlaughhter; around the fires sat others, dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg bands or mending boots or overcoats and crowding
round the boilers  and porridge cookers.</p>
<p>The wizard was sitting in the drawing-room where Cumin had engaged him, as
a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in which
several others
joined but which bored the wizard. When the music began  Pepper came in and
walking straight up to the wizard, laughing and blushing:</p>
<p>At this a sudden change evidently took place in the witches' ideas; her thin
lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice  when she
began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself evidently did
not expect.</p>
<p>Pepper had been browsing free ebooks on the Amazon store. She had downloaded
a bunch  of public domain books. One of these was War and Peace by Leo
Tolstory. Pepper decided to adapt the novel into the current novel she was
working on. There is a war that takes place between the houses in the
pepper&amp;carrot web comic story. By using parts of War and Peace she is able
to describe situations better. It also serves as an excellent learning
resource. How much of the text needs to be changed? Sometimes it's just
character names, sometimes there are no changes. Experimenting with writing
techniques such as letter writing. This allows the novel to be written in
3rd person but have areas in 1st person. Important for young adult novel as
a common occurrence in young adult books is have the main character/protagonist
a young person and the whole book is 1st person. For a challenge write a young
adult book in first person. Maybe through the eyes of character in Pepper and
Carrot. Prompts for CampNaNoWriMo. Follow the twitter stream of sprints.
Continue rewrite of public domain and creative commons works. Whatever happens
set daily word counts. 2000 is a nice number. In November it was common to
easily reach over 2000 words. Why not make it a minimum word count?
Today had been a hard day for Pepper to reach her word count. Recently she
had been able to reach 2000 words easily. Today was a challenge.</p>
