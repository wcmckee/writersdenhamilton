<p>'What could be preping for?,' Vanessa
wondered. She watches as Antony hands
Detective a device. Then the footage stops.
'Damn it', Vanessa curses.
Something happens that causes all the
eletronic devices in the area to stop
working. What they have created is a kill
switch, even if they don't relize it.
Vanessa stood up from her chair.
The camera footage from now is useless.
She needs to find out what that substance was
and how it brought Detective back to life.</p>
<p>Detective agreed to the tasks that Antony
had shown him on the paper. He didn't
agree with them - they involved either
killing or hurting innocent people - people
that had no idea about their effect or
generations after them effect on society.
Steering at the list of names, dates and
times, and event almost brought him to
tears. He had to hold back his emotions.
If Antony had any idea that he was fully
consisious then he would be destoried.</p>
<p>Vanessa had finished researching on the
substance that Antony injected into
Detectives brain - bringing him back to life.
She stood in his surgery room. This was a
hidden room in the palact that had a bunch
of terminal computers and a table for performing surgerys. There was suspession
of something like this - but this was
horrific. Humans had been going missing and
Vanessa had just worked out what was
happening - Antony was capturing them and
performing surgery on them. He was using the
computers along with the traditinal medical
aplications. Vanessa had found evidence that
Antony was spicing DNA - mixing alien and
human genes together to create monsters like
himself.</p>
<p>6b345 and Blitz had been assisting Antony in
the lab. 6b345 had been riped to pieces when
they spaceship blew up entering the Earth
atmosphere. Bliz had died in the accident.
Vanessa had set the explosives on their ship
to explode when it entered the Earths
atmosphere. She hadn't expected it to blow
up over the building that she was attempting
to smuggle Joey out of - leading to a quick
escape.  It happened though.</p>
<p>robots and a cat. The strangest of lab
assistences.</p>
<p>On the wall was a framed painting of
Loth'Rak. Vanessa could reconise him. Antony
looked very similar to him. Antony had more
human features though. Loth'Rak was a
full alien, well Antony was only half.</p>
<p>Have they been talking about Vanessa, Antony,
and Detective too much with the focus taken
away from some other major events.</p>
<p>What happened to Sarah in the NASA testing
room. They were preping for the Moon blast.
The humans knew it was coming. When Detective
was sent back by Antony for the first time in
order to attempt to save Antony from being
driven out of Mars by Vanessa.</p>
<p>6b345 changes a file that he finds on Mars so
that the robot uprising happens. This begins
when 6b345 finds a red usb on mars. It
contains the system details for the artcontrol
AI system that was developed to create art.</p>
