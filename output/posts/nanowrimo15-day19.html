    <p>Vanessa preped the ship for landing. She needed to make sure that the data on Antony and what happened would be released to the humans of Mars
incase she was captured and the information not released. She needed to come with a plan to make sure that the information would still be released.
Had had access to the old terminal computers on systemcontrol on mars. She was able to sync accross the data to these systems and it would all be
released to the humans on Mars in the next 24 hours. The information would be sent to their mobile phones and home computers. Vanessa planned to
announce it to the world before this happened. She created this as a backup plan.
It was too dangerous to land and broadcast the announcment so Vanessa decided to broadcast the announcement from Mars atomophere through the
satalights that were hoovering above the planet. Vanessa started to setup what she would need to broadcast. A camera, a laptop, and a microphone.
It wasn't going to fancy but it would have to do. She setup two seat. One for her and another for Joey. She connectect the camera to the laptop and
booted it up. A desktop apeared on the computer. Vanessa used the touchpad and opened up the opensource video recording software. 'Testing One, Two,
Three', she spoke into the mic. The laptop was reconising the mic. She turned on the camera - hit record and giving a wave in front of the camera.
She pressed stop and tested that the footage recorded. She watched the footage of her waving in front of the camera. Everything seemed to be setup
She just needed to make sure she was able to stream it to all the Humans on Mars.</p>
