<p>William McKee is an artist,
web/software/videogame developer, writer,
public speaker, photographer, videographer,
and educator.</p>
<p>He volunteers for Creative Commons NZ
helping to promote Creative Commons.
Everything he creates
is licensed under a Creative Commons license,
with preference for the more liberal, and
open culture licenses - CC BY and CC BY-SA.</p>
<p>His art can be found at
<a class="reference external" href="http://artcontrol.me/">http://artcontrol.me/</a> and is
available under a Creative Commons
Attribution (BY) license.
William is a supporter, user, and developer of
open source software and hardware. He is passionate
about early childhood education.</p>
<p>In November 2015 William successfully 'won' NaNoWriMo. The
novel he wrote one day at a time for the month titled
It Will Not Be Mine is a Science Fiction novel which
William has licensed under a CC BY license.</p>
<p>"Creative Commons is useful to an artist to promote
the work and it makes the world a better place," says
William. "Others may find new uses with my content
and even make money, good on them!"</p>
<p>During High School William spent the majority
of his senior years in the Design room. Spending the majority of his time creating vector
designs.</p>
<p>William became interested in
drawing after leaving high school and
attending UCOL in Palmerston North.
There he had a drawing tutor, Mark,
who inspired him to keep a drawing journal.
William gained the habit of carrying a
sketchbook wherever
he goes, along with a pencil or pen.</p>
<p>William created the site artcontrol.me:
The Art Of William McKee.</p>
<p>The site was created for a home for William
to host his artwork and reflect upon it.</p>
<p>Originally powered by WordPress, he has since
switched to the Python static website
generator - Nikola. This powers his various sites.</p>
<p>William was always interested in using
a Creative Commons license, he at first
chose to use a more restrictive
Attribution-Noncommercial (BY-NC) license
for his artworks, though soon chose to use
the liberal Attribution (BY) license.
William doesn't see many reasons for artists
to use NC licenses, and finds it especially
problematic when NC licensing is used by
governments.</p>
<p>As William argues, "Tax payers have already
paid for the material. It should therefore be licensed under the most liberal licenses
(perhaps even public domain/creative commons
zero). This allows the most freedom for
people to do what they like with the content."</p>
<p>I like the idea of attribution. Everyone should be
licensing their copyright work under a Create Commons Attribution license or
zero.</p>
<p>William also point out that the
"Non-Commercial licenses are hard to
interpret, as was noted in a German court
case in 2014, which strongly limited the
interpretation of NC to 'personal use.'
Similar problems with the interpretation
of NC could exist in other countries.
This is why I think everyone should avoid
the NC license. I would actually prefer that
the NC license not exist in the first place."</p>
<p>The good thing, Williams says, is that the
majority of New Zeal and government works
released under CC seems to be under CC BY,
though he is concerned that some schools
seem to have adopted an NC license.</p>
<p>In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended
The Learning Connection, where he began to
focus on life drawing. This was created on
brown paper with an easel. Pencil, colored
pencil, oil pastel, acrylic paint, gouache,
watercolors were the media that he used.</p>
<p>William had done digital painting since
attending UCOL with illustration classes.
He used a Wac on tablet. Currently for his
digital painting William uses an Into us 5
small tablet connected to a Raspberry Pi
computer. The software he uses is GIMP 2.8
and it is running the operating system
Rabin (Debian Jessie, Stable). William uses
a battery pack plugged into the Pi to power it.</p>
<p>William uses the Pi to edit text. Plugging
in a keyboard and uses terminal with the
software to edit text.</p>
<p>Digital later focused on portraits using GIMP, an free and open source
raster graphics software. William began by
painting on a windows desktop and laptop,
later switching to Fedora and Debian.</p>
<p>He uses a Raspberry Pi 2b with a 480PX by 320PX touch screen and
Wacom tablet attached.</p>
<p>Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait
and figures were drawn from references on
RedditGetsDrawn.</p>
<p>William would draw portraits of people and
give them the drawing - taking a photo for
his own reference. pencil and colored pencil
was the media used mostly.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the page he would sign
with McKee artcontrol.me and write 'cc by'
on the piece of original artwork.
These were mostly completely in pencil
and colored pencil.</p>
<p>William is also passionate about working
with children. In 2014 he volunteered at
Huang Early Learning Cent re,
where he would work collaboratively with
kids, often on the same piece of art,
using oil pastel, pencil, and colored
pencil.
He was influenced by the children artwork
- often redrawing elements of their works.
The children works were taken into digital
painting. With GIMP artwork is digital traced.</p>
<p>William took the liberty of licensing these
works under a CC BY license - photographing
and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me.
He would create large chalk murals on the
ground outside, with children requested that
he draw comic book characters like the Hulk,
Spider man, Bane, and Batman. These mural
pieces were created on the fence line of
Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School.
Swarms of school children would crowd the
fence line - watching and discussing the
artwork with him. They were blown away
from how quickly he worked and the
quality of his artwork.</p>
<p>"A hope of mine," William says,
"was the children would learn that art was
about sharing and remixing - something
Creative Commons has at its core."</p>
<p>William has since become a volunteer for
Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand,
helping to spread the word about
Creative Commons licensing.
