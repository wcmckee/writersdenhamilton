William Mckee is an artist. His art can be found at artcontrol.me and is advable under a creative commons by licence.
Out of highschool William seriously became interested in drawing. He gained great motivation for it from attending UCOL in Palmerston North. 
There he had a drawing tutor - Mark who inspired him to keep a drawing journal. William gained the habit of carrying a sketchbook wherever 
he goes, along with a pencil or pen.

During his time at Palmerston North School of Design he registed the domain artcontrol.me and creating the site 
artcontrol.me: The Art Of William Mckee. 
It was hosted with GoDaddy and was running CentOS. The site was powered by WordPress, switching later to Nikola. 
He later also switched this to DigitalOcean with the operating system Debian. 
The majority of his machines are running Debian. Fedora is on a couple.
At first he choose to licence this under a creative commons nc by licence. Later making the decision for cc by removing the nc licence. 
He has many problems with the nc licence and would never use it again and don't see many reasons for people to use it. 
He has a problem with education, govt, and publicly funded works to be under nc. The good thing the majority of govt seems to be under cc by. 
Certain schools in the county have a nc licence which is troubling - especially when all schools have it. 
In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended The Learning Connexion. 
It was here that he focused on life drawing which he was only dabbed with in the past.
GIMP was used for all the digital paintings created. He painted on a windows desktop and laptop. 
Later he switched to Fedora and Debian. He painted rarely but enjoys painting with the Raspberry Pi computer and
Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait and figures were drawn from references on RedditGetsDrawn.
He would draw portraits of people and give them the drawing - taking a photo for his own reference. 
At the bottom of the page he would signit with wcmckee artcontrol.me and write cc by on the piece of original artwork. 
These were mostly completely in pencil and coloured pencil.
William is passionate about working with children. In 2014 he volunteered at Whaihanga Early Learning Centre. 
His Mother - Linda worked there as the head teacher. His favourite activities were the art area and build structures with wooden blocks. 
He would work collaboratively with kids often on the same piece of art. Oil pastel, pencil, and coloured pencil were the most commons media 
choices. He was very influenced by the children's drawings - often redrawing elements of their works. A hope was the children learn that art 
was about sharing and remixing - something Creative Commons has at its core. William took the liberty and licenced these works under a cc by 
licence - photographing and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me. He would create large chalk murals on the ground outside. 
Hulk, Spiderman, Bane, and Batman were common requests of characters to draw from the children. These mural pieces were created on the fenceline 
of Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School. 
Swarms of school children would crowd the fenceline - watching and discussing the artwork with him. 
They were often blown away from how quickly he worked. Some of the collab works were developed further with digital painting. He volunteered at Fairfield Community Centre where he drew with children aged 5 to 12. 
Felt tip pen was the main media here and he applied much the same techniques with collaboration as at Whaihanga.
