    <p>It's over. Complete. The mission was a success. Who knows what will happen now? The vision had gotten worse for Detective. He wasn't able to move
the past as fast as he use to be able to. He knew he would be waking up on the ship soon. He knew he didn't have long left. Detective had one last
mission that he needed to finish before he awoke agin. He had gained great acrieciy when the event was going to happen. He was preped for returning
to the ship. There were several seniours that he went over in his head. The first was that he awoke and Antony was sitting in front of him, likely
drinking a cup of coffee. Another is he awakes and no body is there, and no body ever shows up for him. He awakes strapped to an empty ship with
no help on the way. With luck help would be on the way. A woman called Vanessa should find the ship and get Detective out of there - taking him
back to Mars. This was the plan and what he had worked so hard to make sure that it came true.</p>
