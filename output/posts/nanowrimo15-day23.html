<p>Antony was running low of the substance. He had just enough to give Detective an injection when he awoke.
once there live a man who lived in a big house
hr had everything he wanted in that house. To tell you the gftruth that house was in fact
not a house but it was a spaceship.</p>
<p>Vanessa had located Antonys ship. She didn't want to get too close to hi sship or
he might notice her. She decided to

<p>Detective found and captured Antony at a technolgy conference. It is the same conference Joey and Vanessa meet in. When Detective gets sent back
