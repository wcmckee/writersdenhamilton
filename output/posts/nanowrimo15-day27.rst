Antony, Detective, Sarah, Vanessa, Loth'Rak, Joey. These were the names on the document. Each name had a section that contained information on that 
name. The document had been put together by Vanessa. It contained all the information she could find in her research. The name of the document 
was: It Will Not Be Mine. It was named after a mod on a popular Redditsubreddit. It was also refered to the fact that the time split device wasn't 
able to be kept by anyone. They couldn't work out what happened to the device in the end. There are areas on the report that were not complete. 
Were the machines created to create artwork or were they made to be militery units? The details on the reasons is sketchy. Reports show they were
used for a range of reason - one of them being details from Sarahs folder. There was evidence to show that the machines had been used in some sort
of education area and even developed further to create open resources. 	This may of not been the primary reason but it was good enough. 

Loth'Rak lived on a planet with the rest of his race. One day he was on one of the nearby planets and several large blasts killed everyone on his 
planet. Loth'Rak was alone. After he found Earth he created Antony - a half-alien, half-human using genes from him and human genes. Loth'Rak was 
dying and wanted to make sure his race lived on after he died - through Antony. This is the original timeline. Other timelines tend to differ
here in events. For example in the robot dominace timeline Loth'Rak comes to Earth much later - and for a different reason. 

Some of the character meet. Not everyone does though. Some of the timelines characters don't exsist - such as in the robot dominated line Antony 
is never created. Loth'Rak never had a reason to create him. Antony ends up in the line - dragged accross from anothe.

Antony looked out over the waterfront. The wind howled outside but he was safe inside the building. Large windows overlooked the view. This was his
favorite spot to sit and watch. He knew that everything here was gone. It couldn't recovered but he liked the idea that he could go back and view 
what it use to be like. Before the attacks. Antony never had a chance to meet his father - Loth'Rak. He had been in the same room as him in less 
than an hour apart. Maybe that's why he became so angry. After being driven from Earth Antony lost everything. He was alone on a strange planet. He
started to create his creatures. They didn't work out for him though. He always regreated creating Blitz. Would of his Father regreated in creating
him? What would he say to him? Call him a monster and abo. Antony had seen images of his Father through the It Will Not Be Mine research file. He
could see the similarities in himself. They had a similar blue tint in their skin. Unlike humans they both had four arms. Antony had the image of 
his father on his bedroom door. It servered as a reminder to who he really was. The photograph had been framed. A silver frame helped focus the 
viewer onto the image. Antony smiled as he viewed the image, running a finger along the photograph. His mission was almost complete and he would 
be reunited with his Father. He was annoyed with Sarah for not letting him stay around for when his Fathers ship arrived. She made him rush off and 
miss out on seeing him. They had brought Detective into the room so that Loth'Rak and Detective could meet. Sarah told Antony that it was too 
dangerous for him to hang around and they needed to get out of there. Antony had a feed of the rooms video footage. He watched the footage of him 
and Sarah straping down Detectives body and exiting the room. Fast Forward the footage showed a figure in the room with Detective. Zooming closer 
to the footage he could tell that it was Loth'Rak. He looked the same as he did in the photo. Loth'Rak wouldn't even know Antony exsited. As far 
as Loth'Rak was concerned - Antony wasn't even created in this timeline. Antony was here though. He was real in the timeline. He's not sure if he
is missing in another - or this is just a copy. Whatever it is - it's incredivle that Antony is there. The monitor flickered with static. He had 
lost the signal to the feed. Antony couldn't see what what happening with Loth'Rak and Detective. He started to panic, typing in commands to make it
work. It was no use. The feed was gone. Could events be changing already? He thought that Detective may of already handed Antony the timesplit 
device and it would of changed events. Everything had became confusing for Antony. He didn't know what he was doing was helping or not. In many 
ways he wanted to give up and let someone else take off this tasks. He was wanted to retire. To live on the beach. To not worry every day about 
what was going to happen next. It made him neverous just thinking about it. He neeeded a holiday at least. That was the minimal that could happen. 
Antony liked the full documents. The uncensored version. The version where he is including. Blocking him out and avoiding it doesn't change the 
past. It just stops people from learning from his actions. Killing Sarah was the action that most upset. The documents said that Sarah died from 
natural causes, which was false. Antony had shot her in the head. Another timeline of Sarah knew this was the case and accepted it. Sarah would 
live on through her reseach. 

The Robots had developed special diving gear that allowed them to be under water for long periods of time. When the humans had created them the 
material that was used would rust if exposed to water for a long period of time. This lead to problems when Earth is attacked - leading to many 
of the robots being exposed to water and rusting. To prep for this the robots designed a special suit that they could wear in order to not rust 
in the water. This allowed them to live under the ocean 

There was much protest to do with the outcome ideas for Antony. Some wanted his actions wiped from history. Others argued this was a form of 
censorship and the humans could learn something from his actions - even though they didn't agree with them. Two versions of the research was 
produced, one being the full and complete record and the other being the censored version that removed all mention of Antony. The majority of people
believe the full and complete version is the only true copy of the document. The text was licensed under a Creative Commons Attubuation licence with
