<p>Antony walked over to Bliz and patted
her. He had had the cat for 6 yeasrs.
She pured as he stroked her. He had
started mixing his genes with that of
animals, to see the effects that it
would cause. No one would ever have as
much alien gene as Antony for he was
half alien and human. Blitz had been
created with a mixture of Antonys
Alien/Human genes and mixed it a a
third - cat gene. This caused some
interesting effects in the creature.
Antony had focused on the cat gene in
so the cat had a cat like body and legs.
It was coloured blue - something it
inherited from his alien genes, the cats
face was human like, with human looking
eyes. It's puples were cat like. It had
a flat human nose. It's mouth was human
- and had wiskles coming out the side.
Antony had hoped that Blitz would be
able to speak, but so far it could
only meow and make sounds that sounded
like the alien native language.
Antony had been on Mars for the past 14
years. He had escaped Earth when his
identity was discovered. His Father -
Loth'Rak had setup a base for him incase
he ever needed to leave there. He needed
to stay in his half form and had since
lost the ability to switch back to full
human. He was loney alone on Mars so
therefore had created Blitz in order to
keep him company. The lack of
convosation was annoying.</p>
<p>Sarah and 6b345 made their way through
the deserts of Mars. Up ahead they
spotted a small base came. The two moved
towards it with caucion. A cat like
creature was
walking around outside. Sarah and 6b345 had
never seen anything quite like it before.
'Is it a mutation', Sarah asked 6b345.
The database system part of 6b345
analized the creature. 'its returned three different
dna types - cat, human and an unknown
alien dna.</p>
<p>The Cat spotted the two sneaking up to
the hutt. It rushed inside in fear.
Sarah moved towards the front door.
She felt at gun in the back of the neck.
The voice spoke, 'Dont move or I will
shoot'. She started to move her arms. A
blast sound blasted. Sarah dropped to the
ground. 'Shouldn't have moved', the voice
spoke. It was Antony. 6b345 rushed over
to Sarahs body. 'What have you done',
6b345 yelled at Antony. 'She moved',
replied Antony. 'We needed her to finish
the mission', explained 6b345. 'No we
dont, we can do this ourselves. Help me
move the body'.</p>
<p>Antony and 6b456 moved Sarahs body.
Antony picked up a shovel and threw it
at 6b345. 'dig', he ordered. 6b345
started to dig the whole to bury Sarahs
body.</p>
<p>Detective was crushed under the vevhile
that had rolled on him. Up ahead he
watched as the presidents car flipped.
He used his strength to move the car
from ontop of him. His body would need
several minutes to recover. Detective lay
there and breathed slowely. His body was
in pain, but it was recovering quickly.
He stood up and started heading down
towards the Presidents flipped car.
From a distance it looked too late - the
car was in flames.</p>
<p>As he walked, he heard another explosion
behind him. It was aimed at the crowd of
people whom had been watching the
Presidents speech. The president was his
piriority. The car was on fire and tipped
upside down. he opened the backdoor and
pulled the President from the car. He
was too late. The President was dead.</p>
<p>BREAKING NEWS. The President is dead
but NASA will continue with the mission
to launch 80,000 human souls to Mars is
still a goahead. A new President is
currently being swarn in and has given
his blessing to the mission. The people
will be forzen and transported to Mars.
Should there come a need in the future
to active them - we will do so.
The President is expected to give a
briefinng in two hours.</p>
<p>Vanessa didn't know anyone at the
conference. Knowing noone wasn't such a
bad thing though, it allowed you to meet
new people easily and not hangout in
usual groups.</p>
<p>She drank her cup of coffee well standing
in among a group of people. They were
talking about a new security bug found
in a web app. She sipped her coffee as
she listened to the convosation.
People started to move into the main
area for the keynote speaker.
Vanessa followed the group into the room
and found a seat to watch the keynote.</p>
<p>Joey awoke. He was surrounded by a red
sandy wasteland. He doesn't reconise it.
It doesn't look like Earth. He can see
a base in the distance. He walks towards
it. Inside is a alien creature and their
alien cat. He witnesses the alien creature
killing Sarah. Alien creature tries to
hunt him down. He escapes and is brought
back to his own time.</p>
<p>Once back in his own time he can't
remember correctly what happened, but
puts the pieces together - making sure
that humans will find out if they ever
return to Earth.</p>
<p>'I like the idea of blowing up the moon.
Enough explosives to blow it up.
It's science fiction. I can do whatever
I want', spoke Antony. 'It was the humans
that killed my race'
Antony had tracked a group of artcontrol
robots that were expoloring the Earths
moon.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to be escaping to Mars.</p>
<p>All characters have to die by ray
guns.</p>
<p>Revenge for Antony since he is the last
remaining part-alien of his race</p>
<p>Once humans are settled on Mars they
want to go back to Earth in order to
discover what happens.
Sarah was to do it but she ended up</p>
<p>Vanessa is the one that goes back to
Earth in order to discover what happened
to Earth.</p>
<p>Antony and 6b345 active the 80,000 humans
They become the rulers of the human race
on Mars - the humans not relizing they
in fact have sinister plans.
Vanessa discovers that Sarah is killed
by Antony. Detective is first sent back
to save Joey but he is later sent back
in order kill Joey. It is Joey that lets
Vanessa know in the future that Sarah is
killed by Antony and that it was Antony
that blew up the Moon in order to destory
the Earth.</p>
<p>Vanessa finds out about Antony being
evil and goes back to Mars and kills him.</p>
<p>On Mars they build a statue of Sarah
holding her teddybeer in order to
remember her.</p>
<p>Artcontrol is walking down the street
with a Raspberry Pi doing digital
painting in GIMP. He admires the statue
and carries on walking.</p>
