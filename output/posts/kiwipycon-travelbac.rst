currently sitting at chch airport after spending the 
weekend here for kiwiPyCon. 
My experience started when I showed up at Catalyst IT on 
Thursday and volunteered for AV. 

Brian was running the AV who I had previously worked with
at LCA2015. The setup for AV was much the same as at LCA.

Four of us were trained (or in my case - refereshed) for 
AV. Toby (who primary did still photography), Jen (who 
worked in track one on the camera), and Zane (who worked 
with me in track 2). I had originally signed up to work on
track one but shifted around on the Saturday morning. 


On the Friday I arrived at 8:30am and setup to record 
the keynote. I was going to film it but Ryan suggested 
that it would be a good idea to let someone who hadn't 
filmed before have a go - so I let Jen on the camera.
I was switched to track two.

I arrived on time on Saturday to watch the keynote by 
Katie Bell. I left partway thorough the keynote to setup
video in track two. 

Recording of the first talk began after morning tea. 
DVswitch was the software for recording - the ability to
live edit - switching between the camera and laptop with
keys 2 and 3 allows the videos to be uploaded to the 
internet with minimal editing. 


The day was smooth with minimal problems. The most major 
problem was at the beginning of a talk I was unable to 
switch to the slides. The frame would just freeze on the
camera. I kept it on the camera and contacted Ryan. 
DVswitch had to be reset and some settings changed to get
the laptop feed working. 

By the final session on Saturday I was tired and needed a 
break. Zane took over the camera - he needed a break from
the sound. I stayed for a bit to make sure Zane was fine
with camera duties, then headed outside for some fresh
air.

On Sunday morning I slept in and awoke at 8am. I knew I
was going to miss some of the keynote but wasn't worried
as I wasn't filming it. I txted Ryan to let hime know that
I would be late and will arrive partway through the 
keynote.

I took turns with Zane on the Sunday switching between
camera and sound. I also had the opitionity to mic 
presenters which I hadn't done before. 

There were less talks on the Sunday than Saturday so 
wasn't so worn out. 

After the conference finished I walked from the university
to Hornby. It wasn't as bad walk as I was expecting, 
taking an hour. 

What am I inspired to work on after attending KiwiPyCon?

One of the most inspiring talks for me was a lightning
talk given by a girl catrin who talked about CodeClub,
and Ministry Of Education.  I talked to her after the 
lightning talks at afternoon tea.
