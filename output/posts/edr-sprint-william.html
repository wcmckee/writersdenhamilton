<p>LETS SPRINT!</p>
<p>Organise the Open Educational Resource
Sprints 2016.</p>
<p>We are getting a critical mass of schools with Creative Commons policies, enabling teachers to legally share and
collaborate. This is good news, of course,
but the risk is that the policy becomes just
a piece of paper, to which no one really
pays all that much attention.</p>
<p>Websites/resources etc should be clearly state the work is under a Creative Common
licence.</p>
<p>Show how kiwi teachers can work together to
make new, open resources.</p>
<p>What's a sprint?</p>
<p>An idea borrowed from the technology sector,
where it is sometimes called a hack</p>
<p>'The GovHack' weekends are one example of technologists, designers and a range of
other volunteers coming together to make new
products and services from open government
data and information.</p>
<p>An example that inspired us was the Media
Text Hack, a team of educators and
researchers got together to write an open
Media Studies textbook. It's now an assigned
undergraduate textbook at the University of
Otago.</p>
<p>The other example was the Oppikirjamaraton
(Finnish for - textbook marathon). This event
involved about thirty Finnish mathematics
educators writing a new textbook for schools.</p>
<p>These events give us working models of how
an OER Sprint might work.</p>
<p>Organising teams have been open about the
problems they had during the event and what
they would do differently.</p>
<p>At tech conferences sprinting is often used
an event where people work towards a goal -
often bugfixes in software.</p>
<p>DECISIONS, DECISIONS</p>
<p>Still details about the event to figure out.
Opened up the process early, everyone can
see how decisions are being made. In the end,
we will have a model that schools,
associations and informal groups of teachers
can use to sprint - or hack - their way to
the resources they need.</p>
<p>So, what do we need to think about?</p>
<p>I'll be reflecting on these issues over the next few months - both here at
NZCommons and in our open Loomio group, with
other volunteer organisers. But here's a few
to get us started.</p>
<p>How long should it last for?</p>
<p>Some sprints last for two days, others just
one. Some sprints keep strict,
family-friendly time-frames, while others
keep working deep into the night. We ought to keep it short and sweet i.e a busy
9/10-5 - for either one or two days, though
with an expectation than many participants
won't be able to commit for the full period.</p>
<p>Technology the bane of many such events.
We'll need to find a technical platform that
works for everyone.</p>
<p>My initial thinking is that Google Docs
will work fine for small teams, and is a
technology many teachers already use.</p>
<p>Some bigger projects with many more
collaborators  have had issues with using
Google Docs, and more technical platforms
like Github have also been problematic.</p>
<p>Participants, volunteers and facilitators.</p>
<p>It should be a two day event. Saturday and
Sunday are usually good. There is the idea
of opening the conference on</p>
<p>What skills do we need?</p>
<p>What's the best mix of practising teachers, non-teaching subject-area experts
(like academics), facilitators and other
volunteers?</p>
<p>We need to keep the focus of the event as by
teachers, for teachers, with other volunteers
serving to support the needs of the
participants teachers. At the same time, we
want to take advantage of the collective
expertise of everyone who wants to help out.</p>
<p>What's a resource?</p>
<p>Other sprints have focused on making single book (or book-like entity). My feeling
is that a resource is whatever the heck
participants decide to make on the day,
and that this should be the decision of each
individual team.</p>
<p>Team formation:</p>
<p>what constitutes a team? How many people?</p>
<p>3-6 seems about right, though I'm not sure
about this.</p>
<p>What about virtual participation?</p>
<p>If we're working on Google docs, this is
fine though virtual collaboration
can breed those dreaded Technological
Problems, which well want to avoid. But we
shouldn't put any barriers
on people participating, either.</p>
<p>What will the events actually look like?</p>
<p>Will involve people sitting at tables,
talking and typing. Minimise
the amount of scene-setting at the
beginning, and look to have a plethora of
helpers to solve problems as they arise.
This will involve giving clear guidance
beforehand. A minor amount of faffing about
at the beginning is probably unavoidable.</p>
<p>How much does it cost?</p>
<p>From our point of view, there are two sorts
of costs: event costs; and outreach costs,
before and after the event. For the event,
we'll need funding or in-kind sponsorship
to cover food, drink, venue, technology and
other incidental costs.</p>
<p>For the outreach, we'll need funding to get
resources on CC and OER to as many teachers
as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, how many events?</p>
<p>Were not sure, yet, though before the end
of the year, we should make some initial
committments.</p>
<p>Keen to have them anywhere and everywhere,
though this will depend on us getting strong
local support.</p>
