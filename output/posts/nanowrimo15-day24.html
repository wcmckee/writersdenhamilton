<p>Vanessa walked into the room. Detectives skin was normal. In some of the visions Vanessa was experiencing of him his skin was
red and infected. To find out what was going to happen next. Vanessa moved up to Detective. He looked suprised, happy to see
Vanessa. She began to undo the straps around him, and get him out. Her plan for when he was out was to travel back to Mars with
Detective. She had no idea what happened to Antony. He had disapeared from the ship. Vanessa thought that maybe Detective had
gone back and changed events. She wanted to review the tapes and see if there were any differences between the two.
Vanessa worked quickly  searching through the tabes to findf out what changed. They had been keeping records and live updates
of a range of timelines. She drank a coffee from her left hand and typed with the other. Her words per minute were impressive.
She was top of her classes. Her Mother and Father were both very proud of her. What she was searching for was any information
that will lead her to find out what hppaned with Detective when he was sent back. She had been researching newspapers reporting
strange events that he could be involved in. One interesting moment Vanessa found was when the humans of Earth sent 80,000 humans
to Mars. She was able to retrieve articles from several timelines and noticed difference in the events that occured.</p>
<p>Vanessa and Detective landed the ship on Mars. A large group were waiting for them to arrive - including Detectives parents. They
were releaved to see him - believing that he was dead and gone forever. Vanessa needed to interview Detective to find out some
of the events that she was not sure about. They wanted to analze Detectives body to try to find out what Antony injected into his
system.
There was no sign of Antony. Vanessa rewatched the security footage that showed Antony disapeared when Detective actives the
time split device. A similar event had happened with Detecive when he was traveling - he found a copy of himself and injected himself
with a substance - causing the copy body to disapear.
6b345 was a great help in working out what happened to Antony. 6b345 had been with Antony shortly after it arrived on Mars. Before that
6b345 spent time with Sarah.</p>
<p>What happens to ItWillBeMine when she leaves the cars in the robot dominated timeline? She glitches and is sent to to this line.
She had already been killed and wasn't spose to be there. After escaping the car she hunts down Loth'Rak who has recently landed
on Earth. She is lead to believe that he may be able to help her. ItWillBeMine locates Loth'Rake who is tied up in a building. She
breaks in and get him out, avoiding the robotic troops.</p>
