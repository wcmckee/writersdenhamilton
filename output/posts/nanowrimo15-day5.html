<p>Detective awoke from the sound of a door slaming. He moved quickly and retrieved his ray gun from beside the bed. He heard peple talking in the
kitchen. 'Was it the police, the home owners, or someone else breaking in?', he thought to himself. He moved out of the bedroom and towards the
kitchen, cauctionly to not not be noticed. He peaked around the corner. To his suprise the very people he had been after stood in the kitchen.
Sarah, Joey and an unknown robot who he didn't reconise stood there.
His headache got worse, and he dropped to the ground in pain.</p>
<p>Micheal pulled up outside his exwifes home. Normally she is waiting outside her home for the lift to work. He tooted twice. No responce.
'What could she be doing', he thought. It was very strange of her not to let him know if she wasn't going to work.
He turned off the car and climbed out - locking the car after him. He walked up to the front door and knocked twice. No responce. He reached
for his cellphone and tried the home line. He could hear it ring inside but no responce. He tried her cellphone. It range and she answered.
'Hello Micheal', she spoke. 'Hi, Where are you?', he replied. 'I am at your door waiting for you'. There was a pause. 'Are you there?', he
asked again. 'Oh yes, I'm waiting outside my place like normal', she answered. Micheal looked around and there was no sign of her. 'Is
this a joke', he asked angrely. 'No no, I am here'.</p>
<p>ItWillBeMine stood outside waiting for her exhusband Micheal to arrive to pick her up from work. He was running late, it wasn't like him to
to run late. She looked down the street to see she could spot his vehchile. No sign. She heard her home phone inside ring and rushed inside
to answer it. She was too late, the caller had hanged up. She went back out the front. A minute later her cellphone rang and she answered it.
It was Micheal. Aparently he was waiting for her outside her home. Waiting where she was currently standing. She had returned home yesterday
afternoon from Uganka and the issue of Detective and Antony. Perhaps those events mucked up time and she was displaced.
She hanged the the phone up and decided to return to Uganka to see if he had made any progress on locating Detective or Antony.</p>
<p>Their bodies were still frozen. Detective was holding the time split device. Uganka noticed blood running down the forehead of Detective.
'That cant be good', he thought. Reaching for his cellphone he dialed ItWillBeMine. She answered. 'Hey, we have a problem here. Detective
seems to be bleeding from the forehead', he told her. 'Yeah, thats really not good', she replied. 'I will be there soon'.</p>
<p>ItWilLBeMine called a taxi and traveled to the building where Uganka, Detective, and Antony were held. There was a chance she would lose
her job for missing work today. The taxi pulled up and took her to the building. Uganka let her in and they both walked into the interview
room. The bleeding from Detectives forehead had gotten worse. Uganka had been using cloths to wipe the blood.
ItWillBeMine took the time split device from Dectectives hand. She examied the device. 'Do you know how this works', She asked Uganka.
'No idea', Uganka replied. ItWillBeMine fiddled with the device. The fiddling caused ItWillBeMine and Uganka to freeze.</p>
<p>Uganka heard a knock at the door. He answered it. Standing there was Detective with an unconcious body. 'Help me get him in', spoke Detective.
Uganka took one end of the body and they both lifted it into the building. They dragged the body into the interview room. 'Whats his name',
asked Uganka. 'Antony', replied Detective. They strapped Antonys body to a chair in the room and exited the room.</p>
<p>The 6b345 sat up on the bench. 'We are on Mars?', Joey said in amazment. Walking over to the building he knew something wasn't quite right with
the planet. 'How am I surviving? The air feel like it does on earth', he asks. 'We have developed the air so it is posible for humans to survive
on this planet, after Earth was destoyed Humans needed a new planet to survive on', 6b345 explains. 'Earth is destoryed', Joey gulped. 'Yes,
over 1000 years ago there was an event on Earths Moon that caused Earth to be unlivable to humans', 6b345 explained what happened.
'So is there other humans on this planet', Joey asked. 'There should be, by my calcalations I have been offline for 5 years, so events may of
changed, but last time I checked humans were thriving on Mars', 6b345 replied. How exciting Joey thought to himself. Humans surviving on Mars.
'You must take me to these surviving humans', Joey said. 'Very well, but it will be a long journey from here, we are going to need transport'.
6b345 stood up and started walking out the door. 'How are we going to find transport?', Joey ask. 'I will be your transport', replied 6b345.
To Joeys amazment 6b345 transformed into a hoovercraft. 'Get on', 6b345 spoke. Joey mounted 6b345 and the two took off into the dusty distance.</p>
