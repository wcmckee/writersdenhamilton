'What could be preping for?,' Vanessa 
wondered. She watches as Antony hands 
Detective a device. Then the footage stops. 
'Damn it', Vanessa curses. 
Something happens that causes all the 
eletronic devices in the area to stop 
working. What they have created is a kill 
switch, even if they don't relize it. 
Vanessa stood up from her chair. 
The camera footage from now is useless.
She needs to find out what that substance was 
and how it brought Detective back to life. 

Detective agreed to the tasks that Antony 
had shown him on the paper. He didn't 
agree with them - they involved either
killing or hurting innocent people - people 
that had no idea about their effect or 
generations after them effect on society. 
Steering at the list of names, dates and 
times, and event almost brought him to 
tears. He had to hold back his emotions. 
If Antony had any idea that he was fully 
consisious then he would be destoried. 

Vanessa had finished researching on the 
substance that Antony injected into 
Detectives brain - bringing him back to life. 
She stood in his surgery room. This was a 
hidden room in the palact that had a bunch
of terminal computers and a table for 
performing surgerys. There was suspession 
of something like this - but this was 
horrific. Humans had been going missing and 
Vanessa had just worked out what was 
happening - Antony was capturing them and 
performing surgery on them. He was using the 
computers along with the traditinal medical 
aplications. Vanessa had found evidence that
Antony was spicing DNA - mixing alien and 
human genes together to create monsters like
himself.
 
6b345 and Blitz had been assisting Antony in 
the lab. 6b345 had been riped to pieces when 
they spaceship blew up entering the Earth 
atmosphere. Bliz had died in the accident. 
Vanessa had set the explosives on their ship 
to explode when it entered the Earths 
atmosphere. She hadn't expected it to blow 
up over the building that she was attempting 
to smuggle Joey out of - leading to a quick 
escape.  It happened though. 

AI Robot originally created to make art and 
a cat mixed with Antonys human and alien 
genes. The strangest of lab assistences. 

On the wall was a framed painting of
Loth'Rak. Vanessa could reconise him. Antony
looked very similar to him. Antony had more 
human features though. Loth'Rak was a 
full alien, well Antony was only half. 

Have they been talking about Vanessa, Antony, 
and Detective too much with the focus taken
away from some other major events. 

What happened to Sarah in the NASA testing 
room. They were preping for the Moon blast. 
The humans knew it was coming. When Detective
was sent back by Antony for the first time in
order to attempt to save Antony from being
driven out of Mars by Vanessa. 

6b345 changes a file that he finds on Mars so
that the robot uprising happens. This begins
when 6b345 finds a red usb on mars. It 
contains the system details for the artcontrol
AI system that was developed to create art. 

The conference that Vanessa attended on Earth
was the Open Education Resource 2860. It was 
organized by robots. They created open 
education resources every day that were used
in teaching of the Humans on Mars. 
Vanessa shows up and messys everything up 
with crashing 6b345 and Blitz into the 
building. 

Need to write Blitz version of the story. 

Blitz was born on 6 August 3555. The dust
on Mars were partickly bad that day. Antony
had created Blitz in the lab. He had mixed
cat, human, and his own human and alien gene
dna systems. It was the same process that 
Loth'Rak used on a human and his alien genes. 
Antony had memories from his Father and could
access all the skills that Loth'Rak posisted. 

Blitz had a speech impediment noticed by 
Antony shortley after he created him. The
experiment created an alien like voice box
that became mutated by a virus that 
contamanted the system. It lead to a bomb 
being set by Vanessa inside of Blirz, leading 
to their ship being burnt when entering the 
Earths atmosphere.

Blitz strided down the road. She enjoying the
rain. On Mars it never rained but she had 
seen photographs and diagrams of how rain 
works.

The body of Blitz was cat-like but she had 
two human arms coming out of the bottom of
her neck. Along with four cat like legs she
was a highly productive, agile, and super 
creature.

The prototypes of Blitz had failed. Antony
had tried to create a mixture of his and a 
animals genes for years. Each experiment 
being a fail. 

6b345 had been a great assist to the creation
of Blitz. Whenever Antony was in the lab he
6b345 was there with him to assist in the 
experiments. They went through attempts of
mixing human and Antonys genes but failed. 
They were using sick citizens on Mars. 

Antony had poisoned the Human race that meant
they were unable to use the time shift device
The files that are on the red USB active the
AI system TechFuncMasters virus. It leads to
the death of all the humans on Earth. Humans
were sent to Mars in order to presurve mankind

This is a story about a series of events that
are attempted to be manipilated by a time
traveler. The effects are grave and 
unexpected where multi timelines 
cross over. 

The story focuses on a red usb that contains
a private key. It follows a series of differnt
and altenative events around this red usb.

We hope you enjoy the time you spend reading 
it. It was created for NaNoWriMo 2015. 

It was the second attempt to write a novel
for NanoWriMo. The account has been active 
since 2011. Only novels in 2013, 2014, and 
2015 were created. In 2014 the novel 
SpikeInfoSec was started. The total word count
was only around 7000 words. It was writen on 
a raspberry pi computer using a IPython 
Notebook in Markdown format. 

The injection had lead to sores begin to cover
Detectives skin. Antony watched as his skin
became red and infected. He tried to use 
substances to counter the effect but every
day it just got worse. 
Detective had been in the coma for 3 years.
3 years of his brain switched off in this time
and active in others. When he traveled he would
of taken the time split device with him, 
leading to switch between times as he saw fit.

In 2015 for NaNoWriMo the novel 
ItWillNotBeMine was created. With a goal of 
1666 words per day. On day one and seven over
2900 words were written. The majority of days
over 1666 words were written. There were 
several days when less than 1000 wc, these 
were disapointing days but motivation to 
increase the count the following days.

The novel was writen on a HP Chromebook 
with ChromeOS. It was typed in a Debian
Linux chroot on the Chromebook. It was 
also typed on a Raspberry Pi computer with a 
tft screen. On both of these devices, 
terminal was used with the text editor nano.
For some of the days a Windows 7 computer 
was used and software Notepad++.

In the end a novel was created. It was 50,000
words, science fiction, a rough draft. I 
published it to the Writers Den Hamilton site
as I wrote it. It's licenced under a Creative
Commons BY 4.0 licence. 
 
Thank you to NaNoWriMo for the event, 
Waikato NaNoWriMo, Writers Den Hamilton, 
Hamilton Computer Club, Creative Commons New 
Zealand and my family and friends for support 
and ideas.  

The novel is reaching 40,000 words and 
decisions need to be made for the final days.

No point worring about the structure. Work on
cleaning up plots and altenative perspectives
on events. 

Once the word count is reached the machine 
gets to sleep. They have a certain word count
to make a day. How do they measure editing?

The robots just type files and the computer 
builds the site and uploads the changes to 
the webserver. Billions of words a day are 
created. The robots are not told what to write
but instead just choose on what to write by 
analizing data. This leads to more happy and
productive robots. 
 
When they were building the robots they relized
that if you made them sad they were less 
productive. Telling them what to do was the 
main thing that made them sad the data showed.
They fixed this by no longer telling the 
robots what to do but instead let them sprint
freely.

Joey loved to sprint. His robot of course 
loved it as well. The robot would show up
at the conference enter at 8am sharp, 7
days a week. They would then sprint for the 
day - creating mostly Open Education 
Resources. They were free to create whatever
they wanted though.

This novel is licenced under a Creative 
Commons BY 4.0 licence.
I like this licence as it is free culture.
Many seem to obsessed with putting work under
a NC licence. Take a giant leap and don't 
licence under NC. 

Can only see people doing great stuff with
anything created. It's exciting see what 
people might do. 

Need to go through some of the older works
and find events and plots that need a cleanup.

Write down the character and all the events,
times and suitrations that the character is 
involved with - from start to finish. 

Make it epic and make it now. Let's get this
finished. The last few days should be a good
mofivater to get it finished. I will likely 
have a burst to 50,000. Once I hit that I 
will be done. I would like to start editing.
Maybe remixing each chapter as a new blog 
post.

Taking posts on nzcommons and reusing them 
on WrtiersDenHamilton. Remixing them. Great
pratice to edit work. This is going to get 
my over the wordcount! 

Vanessa had taken a small ship from storage and attempt to locate Antonys ship. From her calcalations she has a rough idea where the ship could be
She was able access GPS days from the ships camera before the footage stopped. Vanessa marched up the ramp. She had decided to bring Joey on the 
trip with her. Vanessa was impressed with how much of a hand it was once she actived it. Joey could be a help if she locates Antonys ship. 
The ship took off with Vanessa on it leaving Mars atmophere. 

Antonys head hurt. The visions of multi time lines were apearing again. He was running low on the substance to opress them. Detecive was still 
straped to the chair. His body full of life but his mind in another time. Antony reached for the supply cubbard and pulled out a capsure of the 
substance. He needed the injection, the visions were becoming too unbearable. He placed the capsure into a clean needled and injected it into his
arm. The visions imedicatly stopped. 

Blitz was licking Sarahs blood off the ground on Mars when she was shot in the head by Antony. The causes a glitch in the timelines. When Sarah was
shot in the head it causes Blitz to be warped to another timeline where Joey notices him as he is walking down. 

Joey and Sarah walked down the dark and gloomy road. They arms were interlocked. In the distance they could see a shape that looked like a cat. The
two headed closer towards the shape. It was unusal for there to be other lifeforms out in public. As they got closer to the figure they knew something
was wrong. The cat had mutated or something. Out the side of it's next were two long human arms. Sarah vomited. The creature skretched and ran off. 
'What the hell has happened here,' Sarah asked Joey, spiting the vomit from her mouth. 'I think that man Dectective is changing the events', Joey
said. 'Uganka was spose to let us and we would use the time split device,' he continued to expain. 'I have no idea what we do now, we may be able 
to still active the time split device. Just because we didn't activate it then doesn't mean it won't,' Joey paused to let Sarah finish coughing,
'Are you OK?,' he asked, concerned for the coughing fit that Sarah had gotten herself into. The creature had stopped skretching and ran off into
the dark. Joey moved up to where it was standing, licking something on the ground. He debed his finger into the substance. It was a rich red. 
Human blood. 'What would human blood be doing here?' Joey wondered. 'This is most unusal', he thought. Sarah had finished her coughing fit. 
'What do we have here', She asked Joey. 'It seems to be human blood,' Joey explained, moving a sample of the blood into a container for analize
back at the lab. 'Human blood!', Sarahs jaw dropped. She bend down and had a close look at the puddle on the ground. 'And this cat creature was 
drinking this? Why?', Sarah asked. 'I have no idea but there is something crazy happening here', Joey replied.    

Blitz siped the blood that had been left on the floor when Antony shot Sarah. She looked around. Everything had changed. She relized that he was no 
longer on Mars. From what it looked like - she was on what looked Earth. Blitz had never been to Earth. She had been created in Antonys lab on Mars.
Antony had shown her images of Earth. Blitz was part human and cat felling a strong connection to Earth.
