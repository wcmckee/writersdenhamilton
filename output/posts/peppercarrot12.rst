Today is the final day of March. Tomorrow will be April. For the final day of 
March I thought I might write a synopsis of the novel I am planning to write
in April as part of CampNaNoWriMo.

Set in the magical world of Hereva. Magic system or "Chaos and Evolutions".
Follows the six main magic schools:

Chaosah. The house of time, gravity, nuclear effects and underground divine
forces. Chaosah magic flows and controls all of the magic on Hereva. 
Practitioners ten to work in closed quarters and are loathe to share their
magical secrets. Value practical magic over flashy displays. Alter the shape
and size of living beings. Open up portals into worlds outside of Hereva. 
No official schools, preferring instead to use their own recruiting methods. 

Kielbasha (previously known as Magmah). Considered a major school of magic. 
The house of cooking, baking, grilling, boiling, frying, steaming, toasting.
House of alchemy and rare metals. Adepts use a blend of Hippiah and 
Kielbasha magic to create dishes. Create strong material for other magical 
schools. Most notable is Zombiah which uses these materials for their 
animating purposes. Kielbasha is part of daily life on Hereva. Do good by
teaching a diluted form of their magic to the people of Hereva. Hold 
occasional contest for determining who had best mastered the techniques of 
Kielbasah. Those that pass are considered for deeper studies.
