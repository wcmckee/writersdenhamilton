ArtControl machines swept the world. They
were in every school, workplace and home
accross the world. They were tasked with 
making the lives of humans better.
The machines were originalled developed
by the company TechFuncMasters but the 
blueprints and source code was open 
source, so other companies jumped 
in and created their own machines. 
The machines were originally developed to 
mimic artists, but they were developed
to so much more. They were made to 
develop with their human hosts. What their
human hosts experienced - they also 
experienced. 

The humans got greedy though. They learnt
of a race more supiour than theirs. They 
wanted to use the alien tech against the 
aliens.
The Humans had found a ray gun weapon 
that was developed into a larger weapon.
