PepperCarrot. A Novel by William Mckee

She sat at her workbench. Twirling the feather pen in her 
hand. A Cat slept peacefully beside her. 

The mailman approached the mailbox with caution. Warning:
Witch Property, the box read. He had been watching the 
house since these new witches had moved in. Several nights
ago as he was chopping onions he noticed from his window
green smoke drifting out  from the property. He had concerns
for what mischief they were up to. 
What was worse is it wasn't just a single witch that had 
moved in - it was a group of them. Three adult witches and a 
child. He had seen the lot of them leave the house on their
broomsticks. He had thought about approaching the house and 
having a peak through the window but he was worried that there
might be traps - or that the witches return and cast a spell
on him.
The girl had been friendly. He had seen her walking down the
road with her ginger cat. He had been mowing his lawns (something
they needed to do) when she walked past his house giving 
him a wave and yelling "Hello Neighbour, I'm Pepper".
Pepper had a basket containing mushrooms. She offered some
mushrooms to the man but he refused. She tried to talk to him
further but he rushed back inside like he was afraid of her. 
The man stomped up his front door steps, opened the door and headed 
inside.
The door slammed behind him. 
Peaking out the window he watches as Pepper is steering at the 
house. He closes the curt-ins and continues to peak out. 
Pepper calls out to her cat which is distracted playing 
with a moth, "Come on Carrot, Let's finish our walk". 
The two continue to walk down the road. 

The house might need some maintenance Pepper thought. She 
the mailbox and looked out to her home in the distance. 
The garden had grown wild. An ancient oak tree wrapped its
way through the house. Pepper had asked her godmothers 
about clearing it. They were shocked and refused explaining 
that the oak tree was in fact alive and they wouldn't dare
chop it. 

Pepper had been given permission to mow the lawns. Maybe
if she maintained the house the neighbour wouldn't be 
frightened of her anymore. She wasn't surprised when she
was told that they didn't own a lawnmower. 'Put your 
training to use and use magic', Pepper was told. She spent
the morning looking through books for a spell that would
allow her to cut the grass. She found the perfect recipe. 
The ingredients read: rose petals, cardamom, ginger, coriander, 
hibiscus, red geranium, and powdered dragons tooth. All were 
common herbs - except for the dragons tooth which was rare. Pepper 
stepped out the back door and 
headed towards the herb garden where the herbs grew. Reaching into
her pocket she pulled out a pair of secetares which she used to 
cut the herbs. She hummed to herself as she works. The sky was turning
gray, a storm was coming. The Gods had predicted she was going to 
make this spell. The first rain-dropped landed as Pepper finished 
picking the herbs and took a step inside. 
Pepper had picked the majority of ingredients she needed from the 
garden. All she needed was the powdered dragons tooth. It was 
in a glass container high in the shelf. Pepper climbed the ladder and 
retrieved the glass container that contained the dragons tooth. She had
gone to a great deal to retrieve this - travelling around the world in 
search of dragons and attempted to remove their teeth. In the end she 
ended setting up a dragon dentist business and was overloaded with 
toothache dragons that needed a tooth or two removed. Sadly she then
found out that the powdered dragons tooth didn't come from dragons but from
a plant. The Binomial name for Dragons Tooth was Lotus maritimus. It is part
of the genus Lotus. Pepper had to travel to South England for the plant. She 
found it on a field in which cows were grazing. The plant had grown to a 
height of 30cm.
The flowers were a pale yellow colour. The leaves in three's, 'clover'-like 
but longer and terminating more suddenly at the far end. 
Pepper learnt to make sure she knew what she was looking for before setting 
out on future trips to retrieve ingredients. 

Pepper had planted the dragons teeth that she had removed from the dragons 
in order to build an skeleton army. She would order this army to help out with
her duty's around the house. Pepper watered the patch of garden where she had
planted the teeth twice a day but no skeleton had risen.
