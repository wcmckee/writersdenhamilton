<p>Albumin and Detective together watched the camera footage.</p>
<p>Sarah and 6b345 stepped through the steel door at the landing pad. They had made it to Mars successfully. Sarah was now tasked with finding the
ships that had launched and landed on Mars and activating them. She was a little uneasy about 6b345. He original mission was to go to the Moon in
order to find him as there were suspensions that he had been hacked and was acting as a rogue robot. Could the friendly nature he was putting on
just be show?
6b345 scanned Sarah. The readings came up with an unusual high anxiety level. 'Are you feeling OK?', 6b345 asked Sarah as they walked down the
hallways. 'Oh I'm fine', replied Sarah. She stopped holding her head. Sarah experienced a flash vision. It was a scene from Earth. She was with a
man. Their arms were linked. They were standing outside a building door. Rain poured down. In the vision she knocks on the door twice and another
man - someone with a blurred face lets them in.
Sarah is brought back to relatey by 6b345. He slaps her across the face which knocks her out of the flash. 'Sarah I don't think you are well',
6b345 tells her. 'That was the strangest thing ever', Sarah explains. 'Come on, the sleeping bunkers are just up ahead', 6b345 tells Sarah. How
does he know so much about this facility Sarah thinks to herself. Her head still hurts but she continues down the hallway towards the sleeping
bunkers. After everything that had happened, some sleep would be good. The two walked through and sliding door. It was there there were sleeping
bunks and power for 6b345 to charge. 6b345 walked up to the charger and plugged itself in. 8 hours of charge would give it months of charge.
Sarah dropped her bag and climbed into the bed. She was excused and fell asleep immediately. After her sleep the two would go and search for these
80,000 human souls that need to be activated on Mars.</p>
<p>Vanessa stepped up on the escalator. It had been several months since she had been at a tech conference and it always put her in a good mood when
she attended. Being a female meant that she was often gloratized at these events - something she felt a little uneasy about. She had only good
experiences when attending these events. She was warned to watch out for sleazes when she started attending these events. So far she had only good
experiences.
She stood in the line waiting waiting to sign in. The line was around eight people. It was moving quickly. She had printed a bar code out that would
be used to sign in. She was finally at the front of the line. 'Hello, I'm Vanessa May', she told the woman behind the counter. The woman smiled and
said hello. Her bar code was scanned and she was given a lanyard that had her name attached to it. She made her way to the foyer area where coffee,
tea, and juice was being served. The area was full. People were gathered around in their groups chatting among themselves. Vanessa went over to
the group</p>
<p>Loth'Raks scanned the Earth. His ship lay idle
just outside the Earths atmosphere. He was the last
remainder of his race. He had been in search for
other intelligence life and had found it. On this
distant planet that the locals called Earth. He was
uneasy about making himself known to the life. When
<a href="posts/nanowrimo15-day8.html#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>his race had done so before thousands of years ago it
lead to almost their extinction. Loth'Raks was growing
old and needed to pass on knowledge about his race to
these humans in the hope that they may be able to save
him.
He had successfully captured several of the lifeforms
which he was keeping alive in a water like substance.
Unlike his race the humans needed oxygen to survive.
They would never be able to survive on the alien home
planet but he had made it possible for the humans to
breath on Mars, a planet not far from Earth.
He had tested mixing some of his alien DNA with that
of the humans, to see the effects it would create.
The first couple of tests failed but he had just
successfully completed a mix.
Loth'Raks lifted the child from the bed. It's skin was a
faint blue colour - like his own. It's eyes had a cat
like purple and colored blue. It's nose was much more
flat than normal humans. It had a normal human mouth.
Instead of two human arms it had four. Loth'Raks also
had four arms. It had no reproduction system -
something that the humans and his race had very
different. It was a healthy child though. The humans
may never accept him, but they might care for a half
breed - someone part human and part alien.
He would make the humans promise to care for the child
in exchange for the metal that was inside of his race.
It flowed through their body in a liquid form - but
when exposed to oxygen it would turn to a solid. This
meant that Loth'Raks would be unable to survive on Earth,
the insides of his body would harden - killing him. He
had set foot on Earth - wearing a special suit that
stopped his blood metal from hardening. This is how
he had captured the humans.
He was due to expire and had found two humans that were
capable of raising his child - Sarah and Joey McFurson
they were called. They lived on a small farm outside
of Texas. He had organized to meet them to leave the
child. Once the child was safe he would travel back to
his home planet to die. Along with the child he would
leave behind the metal. He had programmed the metal to
malfunction and stop working if any harm would come to
his child.
The child would be able to switch between two forms - a
fully human form and the alien half breed form.
He had shown Joey and Sarah how to switch the child
between the forms, and later when the child is older
they would be able to switch. He named the child Antony. After his grandfather. Loth'Raks stood outside the wooden farm house. He wore
his productive suit in order to stop the oxygen from
contacting his body. In his arms was the small child -
Antony. It was currently in human form. He switched the
child to hybrid form, then back again to human form.
It seemed to work correctly.
He walked forward towards the house. Knocking on the
wooden door. Sarah answered and greeted him in. They
moved to the lounge area. Joey was sitting in a armchair
in the lounge. Sarah had been preparing dinner.
Joey stood up when Loth'Raks walked in the door.
'Is this him', Sarah asked. Loth'Raks had problems
understanding human speech and had installed a
translate device. He got Sarah to hold the device and
speak into it. He replied by nodding.
He handed the child along with the a small caps of the
alien metal to Sarah. He turned and started to walk out
the door. He needed to return to his own planet. Much
longer on this planet would kill him. Sarah and Joey
followed him out the door watching him take off in
his small transport pod. Loth'Raks knew he would never
see them again, but the child would be safe.
Sarah and Joey watched ass the transport pod took off.
The aliens main ship was outside of Earths atmosphere,
but it was too dangerous for the ship to enter.
Loth'Raks made it to his main ship. He docked the
transport pod and exited. He moved quickly to the
control room and started to enter cords for his home
planet. The ship would need to travel through a black
hole in order to get home.
He looked around the ship one last time. Loth'Raks
noticed his ray gun was missing. He had taken it to
Earth in case of trouble. He was sure he had brought it
back on the pod but it was gone. 'What could have
happened to it', he wondered. It was too late though,
he didn't have enough time to return to Earth to
retrieve it.
He just hoped that the gun wouldn't fall into the
wrong hands - the power it would offer the user is
unknown. He tried to forget about it and started the
ships engines. He had located a nearby black hole that
the ship was traveling towards. He strapped himself in
it was always a bumpy ride through a black hole -
something he did not enjoy. He could see the black hole
ahead. The ship was moving towards it. He braced himself
for impact. Shutting his eyes his ship entered the
black hole. A flash of visions happened as the impact
happened. He observed a human man shooting another with
Loth'Raks ray gun. A second vision appeared this time
was of the ray gun being turned into a large weapon.
It was launching attacks on his home planet. The
humans were the ones that had almost wiped out his
race. Was it his fault? Was he to blame for leaving
the ray gun on Earth? He couldn't return. He orbited
his home planet. The black hole had done as predicted
and sent him home. Home to die. The humans must of used the metal he left along with
the ray gun to send the missiles back in time -
thousands of years to wipe out his race. He was annoyed
with himself. Why did he even trust the humans to begin
with? He thought of Antony and how he will grow up
among a race of traitors.
Loth'Raks ship entered his planets atmosphere. It was
traveling fast, and he knew impact was going to be bad,
though not as bad as the experience of traveling the
black hole.</p>

<p>This is the final day of mankind. It happened the day as predicted. The President would give his speech. Joey would be killed in the explosion. The
events that happen when Joey is killed are worse for mankind than it keeping him alive. Detective is sent back again to save Joey. He is in that
time zone 3 times. Different versions of him have different tasks to complete.</p>
<p>Sarah received the artcontrol machine at school. They already were on Mars. The escape from Earth was just a simulation. The moon never exploded.
Earth was fine. Humans could live on Earth. They were tricked into it by advance AI intelligence. The ability to move time backwards and forward.
Sarah goes to space in order to find the metal. Explosion occurs when she is leaving the Moon. Travels to Mars instead of Earth as she loses
contact with Earth. Mars was backup plan if anything went wrong. She had instructions to active the 80,000 human souls being stored on the planet.</p>
<p>Detective searched the crowd for Joey. He would be twelve years old and with his parents. Several times he had attempted to save Joey but each time
failed. Detective had finally worked out that he needed to used a stun gun on both parents in order to get Joey out of there. The perfect time to
reach him in once the first bomb activates. This happens in front of the presidents car. The second explosion hits the crowd. Detective spots Joey.
The first explosion. Detective walks towards Joey. He looks down on him and holds out his hand. He tells Joey that he must come with him.
Detective grabs the child and pulls him to safety. Shortly after getting Joey to a safe spot Detective is pulled back to where he and Antony are
frozen in the room.</p>
<p>Sarah is sent into the future and meets Antony. Humans have successfully returned to Earth. The room is shattered but they use a similar substance
as on Mars to stay alive on Earth.</p>
<p>Sarah travels to Moon when the explosion happens. She sends back Detective from Mars to Earth on the day Humankind was wiped out in order to change
some events. Future version of Detective attempts to kill Sarah
and Joey. It's never sunny and always rains in restored future Earth. The past - Presidents speech is sunny. Moon is gloomy and quiet.</p>
<p>Mars is red/orange. Frozen rivers. Joey looked across the landscape. He had never experienced anything like
it. They raced across the land. Breathing was strange. Air thinner than on Earth. The landing site for the 80,000 humans sent from Earth over 1000
years ago were up ahead. '</p>
<p>Joey would explore the area. Had 3b456 to assist him in finding out what happened. Humans may or may not be active.</p>
<p>Antony makes sure that Vanessa and Joey meet. They have a child - Antony. Detective interferes and attempts to stop Antony from completing his task.
Antony is captured by Detective and uses the time split. Sends Detective back to before the Presidents speech. Sends Antony into future.</p>
<p>Albumin is searching for both of them. When Detective saves Joey from the explosion he is pulled back into the future where he is in the room
with Antony.</p>
<p>Antony is the grandson of Albumin.</p>
<p>Future version of Sarah is on the Moon the day of the Presidents speech. She discovers the alien metal and sends a sample back to the past
before the Presidents speech in order to save Joey.</p>
<p>Sarah gets trapped in the future and can't get back. Joey remarries Vanessa.</p>
<p>Future Detective attempts to kill Sarah and Joey with Ray Gun. He is pulled back to future when he is in the abandoned building with Sarah and
Joey.</p>
<p>Micheal is killed when Moon explodes by drowning. He is in his office when the tidialwave hits the shore. Everything floods.
He watched the sky as the moon shattered. The Earth rocked causing an increase in global temp. Places that were warm - people burnt to death.
Polar caps melted causing worldwide flooding.</p>
<p>Joey and the robot reach the landing site. Sure enough the 80,000 humans had landed and were ready to activate.</p>
<p>Sarah and the robot reach Mars and discover that the 80,000 human didn't make it to Mars. Needs to send back Detective to make sure the launch
happens.</p>
<p>Uganka is killed by Detective when he is hunting down Joey and Sarah. He is shot in the back with Detectives ray gun.</p>
<p>Detective sneaks  around the back of TechFuncMasters he knows of a secret passageway where he can get in. Sneaks up on Uganka as hes about to
unlock the door for Joey and Sarah - but times it badly and Sarah and Joey escape. Detective kills Uganka with the ray gun.
Detective chases after them but loses them. He discovers them when they enter the building he is staying in.
At that point he is pulled into the future where he is in a room with Antony.</p>
<p>ArtControl is in future Mars walking down the road creating artwork on their Raspberry Pi. Breathing in air created from the alien metal.
Electronics are being charged from traces of metal in the air. Ultra fast network speed.</p>
<p>Joey and Sarah had gotten far away from Detective. There was no way that he would catch them by now.
The ray gun that he carried used much more advance tech that what they had in that time. He must have brought it
back with him from the future. Sarah was driving well Joey slept. Joey dreamed of the
events that had happened that evening.
Everything was going as planned. He had received the
private key which he loaded a virus onto it so that the
ships would fail when the ships attempted to leave
Earth.
He had walked down the road in the rain with Sarah. They
had knocked at the door. Uganka was spouse to answer and
let them in. Then they were spouse to experience the time
split that sent them into different time periods.
Instead Detective killed Uganka and attempted to kill
them.
They shouldn't be in this time. Both Joey and Sarah
should be in separate times.
His mind was a fuzz. He couldn't remember where he was
spouse to be traveling. This version of him had experienced
the correct events, but everything changed when
Detective shot Uganka. What was he even doing in this
time? His dreams were puzzling and conditioning.</p>
<p>Sarah looked over and saw Joey sleeping. He looked sweet
when he slept. He must of been dreaming she thought.
He fidged in his sleep. She knew that the events that
occurred tonight were not what was planned. That the two
shouldn't be in this time. What would be the
consequences for staying in this time?</p>
<p>The doctors ran scans on Detectives brain. They had
never seen this type of metal before. Nothing like it
excised on Earth. They had moved him out of the general
hospital and into a govt hospital for special cases.
here he would have the best care and scientists and
doctors together would find out what the metal was.
NASA became involved with the project. They were able
to extract some of the metal out of Detectives brain
and with the sample create a large abadence. They were
unsure about the uses of the metal - but they knew for
a fact that it was helpful for keeping humans alive.
If it wasn't for the this metal substance Detective
would of died when he was hit by the truck.</p>
<p>Even the President became interested in the case. He
visited Detective in hospital and told him about the
great advances in mankind the world would experience
because of Detective nd the metal in his brain.
Detective was finally conscious. He awoke cuffed to the
bed. The room and bed was white. A large 50 inch TV sat
on the bench at the end of his bed. He was connected
with wires. He heard a door open and a woman walked in
wearing a very old styled nurse outfit. 'Perhaps its
a historic dress-up themed party', detective thought to
himself. The woman yelled behind her, 'hes awake'. She
walked towards him. Two doctors followed. They crowded
around the bed where Detective was laying.</p>
<p>One of the Doctors spoke intruding themselves, the
other doctor and the nurse. He explained about the truck
accident and finding the alien metal in Detectives
brain. Detective had no recollection of the events nor
the alien metal found in his brain. It must of been
something that was inserted into new born babies
in the future.</p>
<p>Joey inserted the USB into the computer. Sarah started
to make her wait down the stairs and to the door. She
would wait for him at the door. Joey browsed the USB
file system. launch was the name of the private key.
There was a second file launch.public - the public
key. The public key was loaded onto the servers on the
ships that were bound for Mars. The private key would
allow connection to the ships. Joey typed a command into
the terminal to corrupt the private key. This would cause
the ships to fail. The real key was replaced with the
fake virus infected key. This would cause the ships to
explode when they take off.</p>
<p>All the effect of sending Detective back to load 80,000
people with the metal will be stopped once and for all.
Sarah yelled from downstairs for him to hurry up. He
pulled the USB out of the computer and placed it in his
left pants pocket. He reset the computer and rushed
down the stairs to catch up with Sarah. It was pouring
with rain outside.</p>
<p>Vanessa looked over at Joey. He was scribbling notes into
his pad. She had enjoyed this talk. It was more
entertaining than the technical room. She was enjoying
the stories that the business room offered. It was less
to concentrate on and just absorb the information.
The bank talk finished and moved onto questions. Neither
her or Joey asked a question but several others in the
crowd did.</p>
<p>The slides were all on the same laptop she it meant that
the next talk started 5 minutes after the previous.
The next talk was given by the postal service about how
they are using drones and robots to deliver mail. They
explain how they have replaced the normal postie humans
with robots. They use a GPS data that connects letters
and parcels with where the delivery happens.
They explain how they use machines to scan and sort mail.
They have major depots where the mail is sent then from
there picked up by ground and aerial drones for delivery.</p>
<p>As soon as Detective knows that Joey is safe he gets heads to the nearest payphone. He was visual and practiced this so many times that it had
became a habit. Lead the boy to safely, make the phone call to Albumin that he had captured Antony and to visit us. By this time the current
version of himself will be frozen and sent back. If he doesn't contact her, he may never get back to his own time. The phone rings. and again.
Albumin finally answers. Detective explains to her that he had captured Antony and for her to come to the building immediately.
He is careful not to tell her too much information. He had already experienced these events and if he told her the wrong information everything
they had worked towards could be ruined.</p>
<p>Detectives body dropped to the ground. He had finished
his mission and he had been sent back to his normal
time. The room where he awoke was dark. There was a
man tied up to the chair in front of him. He had no
memory of him and didn't recognize him. The single light
bulb in the room flickered. He looked around to try to
remember where he was. He had been gone for several
years and things might be different in this time line.
He was already experiencing issues with attempting
to remember who this man was in front of him. He stood
up. Suddenly he had a flash. It was of a woman taking
something from him in this room. Did it happen in this
time-line? He thinks to himself.
He walks towards the door. It is a large steel door.
It's closed but unlocked. He walks through the door.
He enters a long hallway which is dimly lit. He
experiences another memory flash. This time of dragging
a body down the hallway. He can't recognize the person
that is helping him with the body - or the body.
Perhaps it's the man tied to the chair? He thinks to
himself.
Detective decides to turn left. He remembers now that
forward would lead him to the building exit.</p>
<p>Turning left leads him to the interview room. It's
empty and looks like its been that way for a long time.
The computer here is covered in dust. The window viewing
shows the man - who Detective still cant remember. He
is still tied to the chair. Detective sits on the seat
and turns on the computer. Perhaps this will give him
the answers he needs. The computer turns on successfully
and he opens the camera history. He rewinds the footage
and watches footage of him and another man dragging the
body of the man tied to the chair into the room. He
watches as the man wakes up and Detective enters the
room. He is holding in his hand a remote device. The
man and Detective talk. The man begins to laugh, and
then they both freeze. He fast forwards the footage.
Pauses when someone else enters the room. It's the
woman from the flash. On camera she looks much older
than in the flash. She does a similar action to the
flash. She takes the remote device from Detectives hand.
Someone else is in the room. Detective notices its the
same man that helped him drag the body into the room
earlier. He watches the footage further. The woman
activates the remote device - causing both her and
the man to freeze for several minutes. 'Did she change
something then', Detective thinks to himself.
He needs more answers about what is going on. He reaches
into his pockets to check for anything. Inside his left
pocket is a red USB that label reads: For Detective.
Detective loads it onto the computer. It has a single
video file on it. He opens the video file up with the video and audio player - VLC. It plays security footage of the room where the man in the
chair is currently. Detective is in the scene as well. He's frozen along with the man in the chair. The woman walks into the room. She injects a
needle into Detectives neck. This footage is different to what was recorded Detective notices. The time-stamps match up. One of the tapes must be
a fake or an alternative time-line. Detective watches the footage further. The woman injects the man tied to the chair with another needle. The
footage ends with the caption. 'Find and Save Joey'. Joey... Detective thinks. That's a name that can remember. He can't picture an image of him.
Maybe Joey is the man tied up?
He exits the room and heads towards the exit. He reaches a large steel door. The front entry and exit to the building. The door is locked but
he unlocks it and opens the door. Detective experiences another piercing headache pain and a flash of events. It shows him walking down this
hallway. Someone is standing at the door inside the building. It's someone new. It's not the man tied up to the chair or the man that helped
Detective tie him up. His face is a blur. It's like he doesn't even have a recognizable face. Detective is holding a ray gun. He points it at the
man and fires. The flash ends. Detective is brought back to reality. A ray gun, he wonders. Where do I get a ray gun? He opens the door.
Outside it's dark and raining. The street is a mess. Detective looks up and down the street. It's empty. Two cars are parked in the car-park. He
heads towards them.
The he tries the car on the left. It's a Red Honda. Locked. Perhaps he will have better luck with the other car - otherwise he might need to
smash a window. The other car is unlocked and Detective climbs into the drivers seat. He starts to take off when he experiences another flash.
This time it's outside the building. He's firing his ray gun at the car he is currently driving. One of the ray guns bullets hits a tire.
Detective is brought back to reality when he notices the car suddenly flip. A wheel had been blown. He was firing at his own vechile.
Detective climbs from the flipped vechile. Luckily he wasn't going fast. He heads back to the other car and smashes the window and unlocks the
door. He hot-wires the car and takes off. He really needs to find someone that can help him understand what is happening. It's just too confusing
for him.
As he drives he sees visions of the other car being driven ahead of him. It's like two worlds mixed together he thinks. He decides to follow this
vision car. He doesn't know who could be driving, but it could give him answers.</p>
