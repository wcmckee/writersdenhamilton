<p>Hello fellow writers,</p>
<p>We had a fruitful meeting last Wednesday. Unfortunately it was the last time our president Shona could join in on the Wednesday meetings, since she's starting a new job in Katikati.</p>
<p>As you can see, I will be taking over the communication part of Shona's, so I will send e-mails to you all (from the writers den-mailadres in the future) and keep the Facebookpage up to date among other things.</p>
<p>However, we still need one or more persons to chair our meetings in the future... Are there any volunteers? I think it is important there's just one person who  just chairs every meeting loosely the way Shona did and who makes after a groupÂ´s discussion the final decision on the topic for next time.</p>
<p>Please think about this for yourself and hopefully we can decide on someone/some persons at the next meeting on Wednesday December 16.</p>
<p>With the upcoming holidays in the back of our mind, the topic for next time is Family Feud. If you feel up to an extra challenge, you could try to write it from the point of view of the opposite sex. So, if you are a man, you can try to write from a womanÂ´s perspective and the other way around. This could be more challenging than it sounds - we had an interesting discussion about it last time...</p>
<p>As always your piece shouldn't exceed 500 words.</p>
<p>Obviously work in progress is welcome too if you need some gentle feedback!</p>
<p>Is there anybody who would like to do a small presentation on a topic of personal interest? Last time Sachi got our creative juices flowing by providing an exercise that needed some out of the box thinking.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jeff gave a brief presentation on how to enter short story and flash fiction competitions and provided us with some helpful writing tips. You can visit the website flash-frontier.com to read some flash fiction and get inspired.</p>
<p>So, I think that's it for now. Last but not least a word of thanks to Shona: we will miss you and the way you managed our Den! Thanks for your initiative and your useful comments. We hope to see you back at the Sunday meetings once they are going to start...! Keep in touch!</p>
<p>Kind regards and keep writing!</p>

<p>I attended The Learning Connexion between July 2010 and December 2012.
My time was spent drawing/painting on-site, and digital painting/3d modeling and coding off-site.
My favorite classes were Dan Wilkinson, Roger Key, Gary Freemantle and Marc Hill, but I loved any class that offered a life model.
I also spent my time at TLC learning to code in Python. The bus trips in the morning from Newtown to Taita consisted of me typing Python code, and returning home. I was running Ubuntu on my systems.
Returning home each night, I would upload the drawings I had produced that day and blog about them. Some nights I reached 2000+ word count. It was mostly self reflection notes about the day and they drawings - talking about all technical aspects of the works - line, tone, areas that could be improved on,
I never did computers on-site but taught myself digital painting (GIMP)and 3d modeling (Blender) at home. I wanted to be a concept artist - but I fit into being a technical artist.</p>
<p>Drawing, digital painting, writing, game development/publishing, Linux sysadmin, av volunteer at tech conferences and coding (still Python) is
my day to day go to.</p>
<p>Linux Debian 8 runs on the majority of machines. Art and games are licensed under a Creative Commons (CC BY 4.0) and code under MIT. I like these licenses as they are the most liberal.</p>
<p>I have several sites that I have built over the years - to host content that I have created.</p>
<p>ArtControl.me: The Art Of William Mckee:</p>
<p>ArtControl has been around since before I started at TLC. It's used to host my artwork. A mixture of traditional and digital artworks. During my time at TLC it was filled with life drawings. I would get home after a long day of life drawing, upload my drawings and discuss them. The site greatly improved my writing skills. Word Counts skyrocketed - reaching over 2000 words in a evening.
Nowadays the site doesn't get uploaded as much but I aim to put some digital paintings up now and then.</p>
<p>BroBeur Studios:</p>
<p>BroBeur Studios is a one man game development and publishing powerhouse. Formed in March 2013 with the goal of taking artwork from artcontrol.me into Video Games. ArtControl had previously done some game development but I wanted an alternative site and identity for the game dev. BroBeur Studios creates games in Unity3d and Python.
BroBeur takes many elements from ArtControl but extends them further with 3d, gamedev, and publishing.
BroBeur also builds software. Lately I have been working on post production video editing. This is done with Python.
One of my latest scripts opens up a random selection of images from a folder - then blends and mixes them together, and saves the results. Other Python programs I have worked on are web scalping (bbc news, various adult sites, and even the TLC sites).
I'm getting it to do a bunch of cool stuff along the way - such as adding black bars to the top and bottom of the screen, text, and buzzy image results. Each time I hit run I have no idea of the results. A surprise each time.
In future I plan on mixing these post production image effects with my video games and work on editing a film/television show.
I use GIT for source control and host everything on Github.
Working on a game for a television show or film is also on the list. I've previously worked on a Dune game that was inspired during reading of the book.
Game Of Thrones and The Hobbit/LOTR are other IPs that I have explored in Game Design.
Games are cross platform - focusing on web, Linux and Android.
Some say my games are not games but more of an art experience. I like to think of them as cinematic adventure games. Largely influenced by game development companies such as
such as Telltale (The Walking Dead), Blizzard, Double Fine, and Lucas Arts.
I want to make games that feel and play like television shows and movies.
A shift has been made away from game development and into software and operating system development. It's an area I'd like to get back into -
especially with the discovery of the game engine Godot. Godot is similar to Unity3d but is crossplatform.</p>

<p>This weekend it will volunteer at nzdevmob2015. It's being held in Auckland. Volunteering was the only option. Of course specifically - audio and
video. They called it in early to help setup with displays. It plans to be in a room where there are regular speakers. A room where it is focused on
quality talks - with slides. It has no idea about the video and audio setup they have. Perhaps in the morning check the internet for previous
conference videos. Even if it comes down to it - records audio on iphone. Hopefully place has decent mics and a camera.</p>
<p>This is the first time that it has attended this conference. It's a barcamp. un-conference. Create the sessions yourself. Given rooms, timeslots,
freedom to do what you like.</p>
<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand - Ideas for a new website. How to find volunteers and allow them to micromanage. Champion volunteers within
volunteers. One of the great things about this conference is the people attending get to run the sessions. I would love to see one that explores
volunteers in small organizations and how they can scale and micromanage. Matt replied to my comment on a new ccanz site. I've suggested to move
away from php/wordpress and towards either a python powered framework or a static site - maybe a combo of both. See how this weekend plays out but
I'll be interested in a session to discuss and brainstorm ccanz site.</p>
<p>I'm going to be staying at Kirsty and Eriks on Thursday and Friday. It's my birthday on Friday. I've been asked to help setup at nzdevmob2015. I'm
looking forward to seeing the setup that they have. It should be quite good - they have been doing this for enough years. They are using Slack
for coms. It's the first time that I will use Slack but it seems very simple. It's like IRC but you have the option to pay for it, as well as it
seems more simple. I'm looking forward to all the free swag. It's been sometime since I've been to a Microsoft sponsored conference - global
game jam would of been the last one - and that was a game jam. Before that it might have been Hack Auckland - which was years ago now.
Other sponsors include TradeMe,</p>
<p>Last month I wrote a novel. It was called It Will Not Be Mine and was in the Science Fiction genre. The total wordcount was at 53,050 words. Each
section of the book is split into daily writing sections. There is no chapters or structure - just what I felt like writing that day. I've certainly
kept to a theme and worked on creating a story. I started to edit the novel towards the end of November. The 28th was the final day I wrote anything
of substance. On the 29th and 30th of November I wrote: 'hello' and 'world'. When editing I started with day1. It had a high word count for the first
day and allot of summery type writing, along with the ideas that others at NaNoWriMo meet up in Waikato had given me.</p>
<p>The meet ups in November in Hamilton were on every Wednesday morning. I got along to several of these. Sadly it was a bad time - 10am in the morning
so the majority of people were at school or work. I think if you are going to have meet ups during the week it's best to have them at a bar, bookstore,
or library. In Wellington they had weekly NaNoWriMo Wednesday meet ups at a bar. I didn't get a chance to attend one of these but talking to those
in Wellington they sounded popular.
Waikato also had a meet up on Saturdays. This was hosted by Lisa at her workplace. This was for only 2 hours. Like during the week not many people
showed up which was a disappointment. On each of the days of this event we only had three people in total in the weekends. The first weekend was
popular - 9 or so people. They found this in Wellington also - lots at the launch party but they drop off quickly.</p>
<p>After writing for a whole month everyday i felt a bit empty and unknown what to do with myself. I had gained a habit of writing the novel everyday.
It was basically my life for a whole month. There was not much else that I did or was interested in. From when I woke up in the morning till getting
a boost on that days word count before I fell asleep.</p>
<p>I stopped editing the novel. I'm not even going to look at it till Jan 2016. Once Jan hits I'd like to edit it. There are plenty of spelling and
grammar errors that need fixed. It's currently a rough draft. Much of the novel I haven't even read.</p>

<p>currently sitting at chch airport after spending the
weekend here for kiwiPyCon.
My experience started when I showed up at Catalyst IT on
Thursday and volunteered for AV.</p>
<p>Brian was running the AV who I had previously worked with
at LCA2015. The setup for AV was much the same as at LCA.</p>
<p>Four of us were trained (or in my case - refereshed) for
AV. Toby (who primary did still photography), Jen (who
worked in track one on the camera), and Zane (who worked
with me in track 2). I had originally signed up to work on
track one but shifted around on the Saturday morning.</p>
<p>On the Friday I arrived at 8:30am and setup to record
the keynote. I was going to film it but Ryan suggested
that it would be a good idea to let someone who hadn't
filmed before have a go - so I let Jen on the camera.
I was switched to track two.</p>
<p>I arrived on time on Saturday to watch the keynote by
Katie Bell. I left partway thorough the keynote to setup
video in track two.</p>
<p>Recording of the first talk began after morning tea.
DVswitch was the software for recording - the ability to
live edit - switching between the camera and laptop with
keys 2 and 3 allows the videos to be uploaded to the
internet with minimal editing.</p>
<p>The day was smooth with minimal problems. The most major
problem was at the beginning of a talk I was unable to
switch to the slides. The frame would just freeze on the
camera. I kept it on the camera and contacted Ryan.
DVswitch had to be reset and some settings changed to get
the laptop feed working.</p>
<p>By the final session on Saturday I was tired and needed a
break. Zane took over the camera - he needed a break from
the sound. I stayed for a bit to make sure Zane was fine
with camera duties, then headed outside for some fresh
air.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning I slept in and awoke at 8am. I knew I
was going to miss some of the keynote but wasn't worried
as I wasn't filming it. I txted Ryan to let hime know that
I would be late and will arrive partway through the
keynote.</p>
<p>I took turns with Zane on the Sunday switching between
camera and sound. I also had the opitionity to mic
presenters which I hadn't done before.</p>
<p>There were less talks on the Sunday than Saturday so
wasn't so worn out.</p>
<p>After the conference finished I walked from the university
to Hornby. It wasn't as bad walk as I was expecting,
taking an hour.</p>
<p>What am I inspired to work on after attending KiwiPyCon?</p>
<p>One of the most inspiring talks for me was a lightning
talk given by a girl catrin who talked about CodeClub,
and Ministry Of Education.  I talked to her after the
lightning talks at afternoon tea.</p>

<p>The first KiwiPyCon I attended was back in 2013. The
location was the AUT campus in Centeral Auckland
This year it is in Christchurch. I have been typing
python code since 2011 so it took me 'several years
to discover the conference. In 2013 I was living in
Levin and took the night bus from Levin to Auckland
on Friday night. I arrived at KiwiPyCon early on
Saturday morning. I had paid for a student/unwaged
ticket. I didn't attend the dinner on Saturday
night. I had my dell laptop with me and can remember
typing python code with IPython Notebook. I didn't
attend KiwiPyCon last year in Wellington. Bit silly
of me really - but I did watch the talks on YouTube.
This year I applied for finacial assistence and they
were very generious - my ticket was paid for along
with $100.00 towards my travel. I am going to be
staying at a friends of a friends place in chch.
It's a caravan so unlikely to be anything special.
I'm not worried though - as long as I have a roof
over my head and a shower I will be fine. The
caravan is located at a park where there are showers
and such.</p>
<p>This year is the first year that the conference is 3
full days. In the past its been just the Saturday
and Sunday. Though I believe in the past they have
had tuturials on the friday.</p>
<p>I've taken a look at the talks. I need to decide on what
track to go to - 1 or 2.
Things I'll mostly be interested in hearing about:
Web Development. API, static blogs, design.
robotics. Raspberry Pi.
Education.</p>
<p>I am less interested in database and cloud related topics.
Things like Openstack.</p>
<p>I am planning to work on Nikola on the Friday. In the
afternoon there are  beginner tuturials, and sprints.</p>
<p>There was a call on the mailing list for people to give a
interest of any topics to sprint on.
There was mention of pip,
and my Nikola.
The creator of Nikola Roberia even expressed interest to
me on Twitter that he may be advable for hours/day if it
goes ahead.
I'd like to see it happen. I will be working on it and
encourage others to join me.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what types of people I would get. Some
may be experts with static blogs. Others may never of
heard of them.
I'll be willing to help people in getting started with
Nikola, but the best thing to do is read the site and
use it before the spring.</p>
<p>Ideas for spring - Excel doc.
Lists all issues.</p>
<p>In November there is the NaNoWrite. Write 50,000
word novel. 2014 was the first year I attempted this.
I'd like to write a self biologey. Or maybe a autobiography
on someone.
My best friend Peter could be interesting to write 50,000
words about.
It might be better to take his character and write it
into a fiction character</p>
<p>Currently sitting in Auckland airport. I have my boarding
pass and just waiting to board. It's an overcast day, but
it's not raining suprisinly.
When I first arrived I had a panic attack and went through
the security without getting my boarding pass. As soon as
I was through security I relized my mistake and went back
to collect my boarding pass.</p>
<p>Currently I am on flight to christchurch. The
takeoff was smooth and I have an excellent window
view of New Zealand. Just experienced a little
turtalence but it was minor. The flight is only
going to take an hour. We are above the clouds and
looking down all I can see is ocean and some
coastline. I was sitting at the wrong gate - I
thought it was gate 30, but
but turns out it was gate 21. I noticed when someone else
was asking about Jetstar and they were redirected.
I quickly packed my Pi up and headed to the correct gate.
I was one of the last thoough the gate but I wasn't late.
There is no free food or drink on this flight.
I have a bottle of water and two sandwhichs. They are in my
bag though which is in the overhead lockers. Once I land
in Chch I will put on warm clothes, eat my food.
I then need
The food and drink service has just closed - we have
almost arrived in chch.</p>
<p>In Python related news the third and final keynote has
been announced - Alison ? who works for Dropbox.
This means that there is three female keynote speakers
at KiwiPyCon. This has to be a first.
It's great there is such a large number but I do hope they
are not keyspeakers just because they are female.</p>
<p>Katie comes from a education background so the talk will
likely not be very techniqaual. Lets hope it's not wishy
washly.</p>
<p>Once they announce trays up I'm going to switch off the pi
and pack it into my laptop bag.</p>
<p>The flight is almost over. It was a smooth flight but my
stomach is a bit sore.</p>
<p>The mountains have snow on them. It is very mountionous.
This has to be the south island.</p>
<p>Sadly I left my camera at home. I guess it's one thing
I won't lose.</p>
<p>The plane is almost completely full - I'm at the back row
(30) and there is no one in the five seats beside me. '</p>
<p>Time to shutdown. Till we arrive.</p>

<p>It's over. Complete. The mission was a success. Who knows what will happen now? The vision had gotten worse for Detective. He wasn't able to move
the past as fast as he use to be able to. He knew he would be waking up on the ship soon. He knew he didn't have long left. Detective had one last
mission that he needed to finish before he awoke agin. He had gained great acrieciy when the event was going to happen. He was preped for returning
to the ship. There were several seniours that he went over in his head. The first was that he awoke and Antony was sitting in front of him, likely
drinking a cup of coffee. Another is he awakes and no body is there, and no body ever shows up for him. He awakes strapped to an empty ship with
no help on the way. With luck help would be on the way. A woman called Vanessa should find the ship and get Detective out of there - taking him
back to Mars. This was the plan and what he had worked so hard to make sure that it came true.
It was a new city and a new place to check. After about twenty or so files they had found that they were finding some of the documents to be
corrupt. Detective didn't know how they could of happened but it happened. They found the files had been scanned with a code that had caused to them
to mofify the virus. Well let's check who could of modified them and why. Although after about twelve or so more steps the files had some of their
ids back. It was going to take the robots a long time to modify the files so that they are fully working. The robots designed a file system that
allowed them to decode it quicker. It would take the file and fun hushes through it. When a correct hash worked they would move it aside. After
billions of hashes had passed and filted then the file was able to be viewed. They were not sure if the file was completely pure and that changes
may of corrupted the file. They attempted to run the new file hashes against the old corrupted file. Corruption that didn't seem right. It was a
test to see if the bots could decrupt it. Once they successfully decrypted the file they were able to send it back to the original traveler that
send them the file. The aliens believed that this would of been Detective. They believed that it was him that was collecting the files for the
collection. After the files were gathered the robots were wiped of the data in the files. They couldn't have the robots knowings what was happening
with the files. Woop bang. Why not tell the robots what research they are doing? Because they wiped the robots minds in order to control them lead
to the robots later releazing that the files were corrupt. This lead to more issues with the file types.</p>
<p>Sarahs space training missions were over she had successfully completed the cource and she was a winner. After she knew she would be sent on the
real mission into space. This is what she always wanted to do. It was after two or three curruption issues that they decided to no longer wipe the
robots brains. They would wipe on reboot. Every morning when the robots were started up in the classrooms their memories were wiped. This meant that
they could be fresh everyday. Students and teachers had to be carefuly that they didn't leave files on the machines as they would be wiped on reboot.
Teachers and students often learnt the hardway when they left files on it not backed up. The schools decided to create a script that would backup
and changes the bots had done at the end of the day and give the ability for them to be rebooted. After Sarah had finished her mission she was able
to take a break. She spent the majority of this time cooking and baking - something she enjoyed. She knew that she would never be contacted again.</p>
<p>Vanessa had reviewed all the footage and research that was created. She had found that some had corrupted and that they were unable to launch
the ships. Someone had gone back and changed the files so that the files were working again.</p>
<p>Where do we last see Antony? He is last spotted on the ship that he escaped Mars with. There is no evidence to show that he was around afterwards.</p>
<p>Vanessa looked out over the landscape of Mars. She had returned with Detective. There had been no sign of Antony on board but Detective was safe.
Detectives parents would be happy that he was safe. They were worried that he was dead when he collapsed onto the floor. Since after the return
to Mars Vanessa had found it that hard to concentrate. Something had changed in the past that meant she was experiencing headaches on Mars. She
was having visions of other timelines on Mars. The timeline she was experiencing was the robotic uprising where the robots have expanded their
empire further to the Mars. All around Vanessa were massive robotic built buildings to house all the bots. Everyday more robots were created. It
was their goal to over load Mars with robots she that they would be a max producitivy. They had found that Earth had grown too crowded with bots and
the only way to expand the bots was to find new planeted. They had launched bots from spaceships into space to travel to Mars. On that day 6b345 had
given a speech. It was this day that Loth'Rak had shown up on their planet. They had never heard of Loth'Raks race before so they were quite
suprised to see him showup. The robots on Mars were contributing towards the research that was being completed by all the timelines. They were quite
happy to do it. They knew they were giving back to the historand future of the universe. Antonys wrist crunched as he moved his arm. He had been
waiting for Detective to wake. Blood driped from Detectives forehead. The events that Detective was experiencing was changing him. At some points
his body would change. Some of the events that Detective was involved with caused his skin to develop red sores. It's halfway there says the
files. After a awhile they got better at picking up the errors. They had multiply monitors setup for analizing the information that was coming through
and making sure that they were correct. If something was found to be be corrupted then they would set it aside and try to work out what was wrong
with it. They had data coming from a range of different timelines, it was hard to keep up with it excatly. On the first and final of the object calls
they decided that it would work out better to get some of the robots on board to start the analizing. They found it was quicker to have them look
over the requests and report back if the files were ok or corrupted. If it was found to be corrupt a special group of robots would take a look
at the file and analize what had happened to it. The files that had been corrupted were massive and couldn't be kept on some of the timelines due
to techniqual reasons. They decided to have one timeline that was focused on the data collection and pull the data int from other lines from there.
The training had made Sarah thirst and she made herself a large smoothy. It was a simple recipe. Her Mother use to make this and she followed suit.
It contained fresh berries and coconut water. Some people tried to make it fancy with adding milks and bananas and ice cream. Sarah always thought
this was too much of an over kill - decided instead to keep it simple with her ingredients. She sipped the blended drink. It was very refreshing.
Sarah managed to drink the whole glass. She had thought about saving some for later but she decided she would just make another later if she wanted
to. She rinsed the empty glass and loaded it into the dishwasher. With the blender she filled it with some warm water and loaded it back into the
blender - turning it on to pulse to clean the container. She left it on the bench to dry. Her training had finished and she was waiting to hear
what her real mission would be. They had kept even her training very secectrive and were doing the same for the mission. Even her boss didn't really
know what she was going to be invloved with. This came from a much higher up place. She was going to be transfered from the training grounds where
she had lived for the past 6 months to a new area where the mission would be completed from. It would likely invovlve some space travel. Certainly
her training had preped her for space travel. She was told that there was a chance that she wouldn't make it back from the mission and that she
should make peace with anyone on Earth before leaving. She was given 3 days to contact people and meet with them about what was going to happen
next. There is still another file left to transfer they found. It was causing a major glitch in the system which meant one of the travelers was
having problems with getting back to their own time. The robots worked around the clock in order to try to fix the glitch but they were having major
issues with getting it to work correctly. Once they finally got the file glitch fixed the traveler was able to get back to their own time. They
were not sure about how much was infected with the system. The robots were worried that the traveler would of suffered brain damage if it was
human or alien. If it was mechanical they would be able to fix themselves. Oh well it's fixed now but they wish they could check the harm that the
files had done. They needed a reporting system that would let them know the details of the traveler. The traveler had a tracking device on them
that may of allowed them to test the files. The robots put it down to either Antony or Detective that was the current traveler that they were
tracking. System wasn't getting the information back quick enough and it meant it wasn't worked correctly.
What would happen if they got all the character in the same room? Sarah died before Vanessa was even born so in that respect it wouldn't be
posible to have so many characters in the room. Vanessa is one of the only characters that doesn't experience the traveling. She begins to experience
the problems with it, gaining some of the syntons that the travelers experienced. It isn't quit sure why they Vanessa experienced the side effects
of the traveling when she didn't do any traveling herself. It's thought that because she was there when key moments happened - like on Antonys
ship that it may of passed onto her through that. It's not completely clear though. Vanessa was smart in how she brought Detective back to Mars but
she didn't expect that Antony had planted a virus in his system so that it would infect the people of mars when they returned to mars. The population
of Mars had increased over the years. Antony had actived the 80,000 humans that had been sent to Mars in order to preserve mankind. Scientists on
Earth who send the humans to Mars were worried that keeping them preserved might interfear with their ability to have children. This hadn't been
the case and children were being born on Mars on a regular basics. They were starting to attend schools and growing up themselves. These are children
that have no sense on what it would be like to live on Earth. Detective was amongest these people that were born and grew up on Mars. There were
reports that he may of been one of the 80,000 that were sent to Mars but this was later confirumed to be false. There was no evidence to show this.
Over time false information in the reports would be fixed and corrected. Detectives parents were part of the 80,000 that were preserved on the
Mars. Detective died the day of the takeover of Antonys power. He collabsed on the lounge floor of his bedroom. His body was stone cold dead.
Antony showed up though and grabbed his body, taking him onto the ship and sending Detective back in time to change certain events. This is the
only time that Detective went back. In Detectives world he was gone for several years but in the past he lived out entire lifetimes. The research
only covers some of the events and there is allot that he would of lived through that wasn't covered. He may of died serveral times in the past.
This was another area that wasn't sure in what was happening. What happened to Detective when he died in one time? Does he switch to another time
or timeline. He is killed at the presidents speech when the presidents car becomes under attack. The humans find the alien substance in his
body and attempt to extract it. This extraction greatly improves the humans tech. If Detective doesn't go back and give the humans the tech they
are wiped out to begin with. This is one of the main reasons why Detective is sent back - to help make sure that the human race lives on after
the Earth is wiped out. Why would Antony want the humans to survive? Antony is part human to start with. Having the humans on Mars gives Antony
power over them. If they were all wiped out he would be left on Mars alone. He had created Blitz with some of the supplies that he had taken
from the Earth. This was a creature that was part alien, part human, and part cat. It was a strange creature. Antony thought it was a wonderful
creation and was proud of his creation. Blitz looked similar to antony as the human and alien genes Antony had used for Blitz where from him. The
cat genes were from an unknown cat that Antony had a sample of their dna. It worked though, the original cat dna had mixed successfully with the
alien and human dna.
Why did Antony choose cat as an animal to mix his genes with? When Antony was first brought to Earth by his Father Loth'Rak his host family had a
cat that Antony grew close with. Sadly this cat passed away after a few years. The Family continued to get more cats as each one died. The family
certainly were not a dog family. Sometimes the cats would die quite quickly - the road they lived on was busy and cars would speed up and down the
road. Often the cars would be crossing the road and be hit by a car. This made the Family sad - especially Antony. This is why Antony decided on
cat as the animal to mix genes with. The other reason is that he found the cat to be the most successful mix. He had attempted other mixes such
as a bee before the cat but these had been largly unsuccessfuly. After about the last unsussful attempt Antony was almost ready
to give up. This had stopped him from comppleteing the mission successfully. h well lets see how this goes. Loth'Rak left Antony on Earth in order
to make sure that someone part of his race lived on. This didn't work though. Antony was driven from Earth and became savage on Mars. They needed
to find out what drived Antony from Earth and if they could fix it. The research showed that it was an event that happened at his school. He had
shown his alien form to another student and that student had told her teacher. The teacher didn't believe the student. Camera footage was reviewed
and showed Antony switching to alien form. The media and militery got hold of this - swooping in. Antony managed to escape Earth and hide out in
Mars until Sarah arrived. Antony had planned on activing the humans himself but needed the robot 6b345 to do so. They had the private key that would
unlock the humans on Mars. It was going to be tough telling the humans that the rest of them had been cleakilled on Earth. It wasn't a fun subject
to bring up with the humans of Mars but it was part of their history and something that they should learn about. What happened on Earth was
something that was taught in schools to the children on Mars. They learnt how the Antony used the robots to destory Earth. They learnt that it was
Antonys fault that everything happened. It was nobody else. Some of the people on Mars believed that Antony hadn't done anything wrong and it was
Sarah that was at fault. Sarah should of never agreed to the mission on Earths Moon. There were arguements between the two groups - almost leading
towards a war. The only thing that stopped the war was the fact that the research was released that showed all the different senerious that could
happened. This helped create peace between the two groups.</p>

<p>Antony, Detective, Sarah, Vanessa, Loth'Rak, Joey. These were the names on the document. Each name had a section that contained information on that
name. The document had been put together by Vanessa. It contained all the information she could find in her research. The name of the document
was: It Will Not Be Mine. It was named after a mod on a popular Redditsubreddit. It was also refered to the fact that the time split device wasn't
able to be kept by anyone. They couldn't work out what happened to the device in the end. There are areas on the report that were not complete.
Were the machines created to create artwork or were they made to be militery units? The details on the reasons is sketchy. Reports show they were
used for a range of reason - one of them being details from Sarahs folder. There was evidence to show that the machines had been used in some sort
of education area and even developed further to create open resources.  This may of not been the primary reason but it was good enough.</p>
<p>Loth'Rak lived on a planet with the rest of his race. One day he was on one of the nearby planets and several large blasts killed everyone on his
planet. Loth'Rak was alone. After he found Earth he created Antony - a half-alien, half-human using genes from him and human genes. Loth'Rak was
dying and wanted to make sure his race lived on after he died - through Antony. This is the original timeline. Other timelines tend to differ
here in events. For example in the robot dominace timeline Loth'Rak comes to Earth much later - and for a different reason. The reason why he comes
back on the other timeline is because he knew his planet was spose to be destoried - it had happened before for him but not for his planet and
people. Loth'Rak discovers that no matter what he does the best outcome for anyone is that his race is killed. He doesn't like this but he
relizes that its the best outcome for everyone. When the humans don't end up getting the tech to destory Loth'Raks planet then he ends up destoring
the planet himself. It's painful for him to do this but he has no choice. The timelines are stuck in a loop until the event happens to progress then
on.</p>
<p>GNU Image Manimipaltion Program. This was the open source software that the robots were trained with. They would use a wacom tablet with a raspberry
pi for the painting. It would be completed quickly and to a high standard. It was easier to get the bots to paint digital piceces over traditinal
works. Tradicial works usually made lots of mess and cost more. The digital work was cheaper to produce and the standard was just as high. GIMP
was often critisised as to not being very powerful compard to proparety software such as Photoshop. The bots couldn't use Photoshop well. People
had attempted to get them to run it but it was slow and laggy. The bots were connected to the ipython kernal running on the raspberry pi. This allowed
them to control the mouse with their brain waves. They were able to send api calls through python and into gimp. Turtle was a popular tool that the
bots started with untill they moved into more complex tasks. As the bots got better they learnt to connect to the api hundrads of times - similar
to having 100s of brushes on a canvas. This is how they got so quick at creating the pieces of artwork.</p>
<p>Some of the character meet. Not everyone does though. Some of the timelines characters don't exsist - such as in the robot dominated line Antony
is never created. Loth'Rak never had a reason to create him. Antony ends up in the line - dragged accross from another line. It is unclear if
Antony choose to enter the timeline but since entering the timeline he has caused great harm to the line. Events took place that were completely
out of character. It's as he corrupted the line. The research again pointed back to Antony and Detective as the two that went back and changed
events. Detective would of been on Antonys ship when he went back. There is no evidence in the documents to show that he went back at any other
point. Events change for certain characters and the relize it. This can be bad for everyone. It's almost over and this is going to be the last
few mooments. They hopes you enjoyed the stories. It's not over quite yet. It's always someone that jumps out and announces that something else
must happen before the story can end. It's over now.</p>
<p>What happens if Sarah isn't killed on Mars. She arrives on Mars after escaping the Earths Moon attack. When she arrived on Mars she found 6b345
amongest her ship. They set off to active the 80,000 humans that were sent to Mars. Sarah and 6b345 travel to the site and active the humans. Every
one lives happily ever after on Mars. Antony isn't there. Humans later go back to Earth to discover what happened. Events play through again this
time  causing more issues. The deeper the timelines wolve between each other the worse the effects. It starts small but grows. Getting larger and
larger till the area is infected. Once it's infected it could burst. When it bursts the virus is unleased into the air. This infected anyone that
doesn't have the virus. It was known for turning lifeforms into living monsters after they had died. Something died with them when they died. When
they were brought back they were never the same. The living monsters were agressive and unable to be controlled. Detective waws an example that went
successfully. He was able to be controlled. They managed to make it so it was completely hidden within Detective. When Vanessa brought him back to
Mars no one even relised what they were bringing back. Ever since Detective died in his lounge he hadn't been human. He lived his life out in these
virtual timelines. One after another. It was an addiction. One of the side effects included addiction to the time split device. That's one of the
reasons why it's so dangerous. It's an addiction. Often the travelers didn't feel like they were addicted to it. They treated it just like a
normal day to day activity, not relizing the harm it was causing them. Vanessa wondered if Detective knew he was addicted to the device. All the
travelers were addicted to it - it was just a matter of if they relized it or not. If they relized the addiction they were able to deal with it
bettter. This enables them to have greater control over the events and how they are handled. People became worried about the virus when people
started dying of it. THey had been infected with it long before they started to die. Detective was the one that had caused the corruption.</p>
<p>Antony looked out over the waterfront. The wind howled outside but he was safe inside the building. Large windows overlooked the view. This was his
favorite spot to sit and watch. He knew that everything here was gone. It couldn't recovered but he liked the idea that he could go back and view
what it use to be like. Before the attacks. Antony never had a chance to meet his father - Loth'Rak. He had been in the same room as him in less
than an hour apart. Maybe that's why he became so angry. After being driven from Earth Antony lost everything. He was alone on a strange planet. He
started to create his creatures. They didn't work out for him though. He always regreated creating Blitz. Would of his Father regreated in creating
him? What would he say to him? Call him a monster and abo. Antony had seen images of his Father through the It Will Not Be Mine research file. He
could see the similarities in himself. They had a similar blue tint in their skin. Unlike humans they both had four arms. Antony had the image of
his father on his bedroom door. It servered as a reminder to who he really was. The photograph had been framed. A silver frame helped focus the
viewer onto the image. Antony smiled as he viewed the image, running a finger along the photograph. His mission was almost complete and he would
be reunited with his Father. He was annoyed with Sarah for not letting him stay around for when his Fathers ship arrived. She made him rush off and
miss out on seeing him. They had brought Detective into the room so that Loth'Rak and Detective could meet. Sarah told Antony that it was too
dangerous for him to hang around and they needed to get out of there. Antony had a feed of the rooms video footage. He watched the footage of him
and Sarah straping down Detectives body and exiting the room. Fast Forward the footage showed a figure in the room with Detective. Zooming closer
to the footage he could tell that it was Loth'Rak. He looked the same as he did in the photo. Loth'Rak wouldn't even know Antony exsited. As far
as Loth'Rak was concerned - Antony wasn't even created in this timeline. Antony was here though. He was real in the timeline. He's not sure if he
is missing in another - or this is just a copy. Whatever it is - it's incredivle that Antony is there. The monitor flickered with static. He had
lost the signal to the feed. Antony couldn't see what what happening with Loth'Rak and Detective. He started to panic, typing in commands to make it
work. It was no use. The feed was gone. Could events be changing already? He thought that Detective may of already handed Antony the timesplit
device and it would of changed events. Everything had became confusing for Antony. He didn't know what he was doing was helping or not. In many
ways he wanted to give up and let someone else take off this tasks. He was wanted to retire. To live on the beach. To not worry every day about
what was going to happen next. It made him neverous just thinking about it. He neeeded a holiday at least. That was the minimal that could happen.
Antony liked the full documents. The uncensored version. The version where he is including. Blocking him out and avoiding it doesn't change the
past. It just stops people from learning from his actions. Killing Sarah was the action that most upset. The documents said that Sarah died from
natural causes, which was false. Antony had shot her in the head. Another timeline of Sarah knew this was the case and accepted it. Sarah would
live on through her reseach.</p>
<p>The Robots had developed special diving gear that allowed them to be under water for long periods of time. When the humans had created them the
material that was used would rust if exposed to water for a long period of time. This lead to problems when Earth is attacked - leading to many
of the robots being exposed to water and rusting. To prep for this the robots designed a special suit that they could wear in order to not rust
in the water. This allowed them to live under the ocean for a long periods of time. They enjoyed exploring the hidden human cities under the sea.
The majority of the land had been  flooded when the polar caps had melted. Only the very tallest of areas were above ground. The robots swam
through these underwater cities. Cities once inhabited by humans. The Robots photographed and documentated the events. They knew their timeline
was special and it may be erased. They put the research into special files that allowed other timelines to access what happened. This is how they
learnt knowledge to counter the effects. The robots put the research into a file along with other timelines data - It Will Not Be Mine. They didn't
quite understand how it worked but basically what it was running was an information grab to all the different timelines that were happening and
collecting information about what is happening. It was rumured by the robots that it might be a traveler that had developed the data grab idea. They
thought it was an excellent idea and were partaking fully in the oberation. It was of great benifit to the robots as well. They were able to learn
of events that were occuring in order to prepare it for it.
Another thing the robots had to prep for was the extreme temp changes. The planet would likely increase in temp and the robots armor would need to
have suits that could withstand the temps. They tested these suits in simulated extreme temp. At first the tests were unsuccessful and they found
the armor to melt. After some modificaions they armor was successfully withstanding the temps. When the extreme temps did hit the robots were ready
for it.</p>
<p>There was much protest to do with the outcome ideas for Antony. Some wanted his actions wiped from history. Others argued this was a form of
censorship and the humans could learn something from his actions - even though they didn't agree with them. Two versions of the research was
produced, one being the full and complete record and the other being the censored version that removed all mention of Antony. The majority of people
believe the full and complete version is the only true copy of the document. The text was licensed under a Creative Commons Attubuation licence with
the data under Creative Commons Zero licence. Being in a open licence meant that people could take the documents and use, remix and adopt the work
to their own liking.</p>
<p>Antony put the pen down. 'Is that all,' he asked Sarah. She nodded. The information that Sarah had shared would be kept in a archieve in case other
time lines needed the information. She had agreed to all these terms. Sarah knew she was doing a deal with the devil dealing with Antony in this
moment. She had no choice, no idea where else to go with the information. At least now that Antony has it would be able to be shared. Sarah knew
the world was over but there was a chance these people could save it.</p>
