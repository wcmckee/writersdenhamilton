<p>Sarah and Joey watched as Loth'Raks transport pod left Earth. Sarah held in her arms a small child brought to them by Loth'Raks. The had been given
instructions to protect him at all costs. They would do just that. Loth'Raks had named him Antony and they had decided to keep the name.
Currently Antony was in full human form. They  were given a device by Loth'Raks that allowed Antony to switch to half-human, half-alien form.
Joey tested the device on Antony. Sarah jumped and almost dropped the child as he suddenly turned blue, and sprouted another two arms. He started
making sounds in a language they couldn't understand. Joey activated human form again. Loth'Raks told them that it was important that forms be
switched at least once a year. If Antony doesn't switch he could be permanently stuck in either form.
Along with the child, and form switch device they were given a metal substance. Loth'Raks told them they could give this to the authorities in
exchange for Antony to be kept safe.
They walked back inside with their new child.
Several miles away a man was out walking his dog when he came across what looked to be a weapon or gun of some sort. He didn't recognize it and
handed it into the local police station. The police were thankful for him handing it in - they too were unsure what it was. They would hand it
onto the government.
Joey and Sarah would have big decisions to make later about telling Antony about his Father and his origins. For now though - he was a baby and
didn't understand. They had several years to wait.
The three walked in the front door. Sarah had activated 6b345 to clean up the dishes. It was a fully automatic robot that was capable of many
tasks - including cooking and dishes. She had activated it to finish off the dinner she started but was distracted with Loth'Raks arrival.
For some reason the 6b345 unlike many other editions was mute. It followed the families orders though - which was the main thing.
6b345 watched out of the corner of it's eye the family walk back in the house. They were holding a child. The machine scanned the child - picking
up unusual patterns. When situations like this happen the data is sent back to headquarters and an investigation is activated. The govt may become
involved. Nobody has any privacy when these machines are in their lives - but they don't know that.
Sarah tucks the baby into his cot before sitting down at the dinner table with Joey for dinner. 6b345 brings over dinner. Roast lamb, potatoes,
carrots, and peas. Their favorite. 6b345 pours them a wine each and sits down at the table with them.</p>
<p>Years passed and Antony grew just like any other child. He attended Kindergarten and started school. Once he had started school Sarah and Joey
decided that it was time for him to learn what he really was. They sat him down and explained about his Father Loth'Raks and how he was the last
of his race and dying - that Antony was now the last remaining member of his race - though he was only half. They explained to him about the
form switch device and showed him how it worked. That he had to switch forms at least once a year.
Sarah and Joey had activated the form switch device for the past 5 years - on the anniversary that Antony was brought to them.</p>
<p>One day at school during break he told some of the other children that he was half alien. They didn't believe him. To prove it he activated
the form switch device - switching into his true form. The other children were amazed and rushed off to tell their teacher. She told them to
stop making up stories. Antony had switched back to human form - the teacher pointed out that Antony was perfectly normal, just like them.
Though the CCTV at the school had captured Antony's transform. Within an hour the media had gotten hold of the footage. Both media and the
military surrounded the school and Antony's home.
Should he ever be discovered Sarah and Joey had been given a plan. They were to activate a transport pod that would take Antony to Mars - far
away from the humans.
When Antony saw the military and media heading towards his school he knew something was wrong and that they may be coming for him. He activated
his form switch device and headed out the building towards home at a fast pace. Sarah and Joey had told him to go to a field out the back of his
home. It was there that a transport pod would be stored and he could use it to escape to Mars.
He made it to the field. Military and media surrounded his home. He could see Sarah and Joey being cuffed. He want to go and save them. To bring
them with him. He knew he couldn't. He activated the pod and climbed into it. It was already set to Mars. He hit the green button and the pod took
off. People noticed the roaring sound of the engines and pointed the television cameras at the scene. The military attempted to shoot down the pod
but it failed - taking off and leaving Earth.
Antony regretted showing his classmates the form and wondered what was going to happen to Sarah and Joey.</p>
<p>Antony awoke from the freeze. He was still tied to the chair. The room was empty. Detective must of already returned to this time period. He yelled
for help. To his surprise - Sarah walked into the door. 'What the hell happened? Did Joey and Vanessa meet?', Antony asks Sarah. 'Yes everything
went perfectly', Sarah walks up to Antony and unties him from the chair. 'Do you have your form switch device', She asks him. 'I don't need it', he
replies. 'I can control the forms with my mind now'. Once untied Antony activates his true form - the half human and alien. Sarah is impressed. You
have learn allot in all these years. 'How long had it been', She asks. 'In Earth years it has been 40 years', Antony tells her. 'wow it feels like
longer', Sarah says. 'I remember the day still clearly today - Joey and myself were so frightened when the police showed up at the door looking for
you. We didn't tell them anything. They arrested us. I then remember seeing your ship take off. I then knew you would be safe'.
Antony nodded and smiled. 'We can talk more later. For now we need to get out of here, Dectecive may return'.
Sarah and Antony walked out the door. Antony lead in his alien form. 'We are going to need to move fast', he said. 'I need you to climb onto my
back'. Sarah nodded and climbed onto his back. 'Hang on'. Sarah gripped Antony's shoulders. He started to dash forward, knocking out the front-door.
Outside it was raining and they raced down the road.</p>
<p>Detective continues to drive down the road. The visions of reality and the dreamworld are turning into a blur. In the dreamworld it's a sunny day,
but in relatiery it's dark and raining. It gives a strange effect to the world. The car that he is following in the dreamworld begins to slow
down. Three people get out of the car - a man, a woman, and a humanoid robots. He slows down his car and watches their next move. Do you think
they could see me? He wonders. He opens the car door and heads towards them. They seem to be moving at a slower pace that relatery. He yells at
them, 'hey guys, what are you doing?'. They continue walking away from their car, ignoring him. Maybe they can't see him he realizes. He goes up
to get a closer look at them. He hopes he could recognize them. Like the man who was shot with the Ray gun their faces are a blur and he is unable
to know who they are.</p>
<p>The three of them walk into a building. It looks like someone had already broken into this building. The front door had been sealed with a wooden
plank but it had been removed and the door opened with something. No attempt had been made to secure it again. He stands behind the three characters
as they open the door and walk inside. They have no idea he is there. They enter into a foyer area and walk down till they get to a kitchen.
In Detectives world the kitchen looks clean, like someone was living here. In the dreamworld it's a mess, someone was living here but during their
breakfast they abadanded the building. Old eggs and toast were rotting on the table, Fly's swarming.
In the dreamworld he heard a thud on the floor. It came from the bedroom. Everyone noticed it. The dream-characters started to make their way to the
bedroom to investigate. Detective wanted to make it first. He rushed in front of the dream characters who were moving slowly. Inside the bedroom he
saw a version of himself. It was Detective that was in the room. Was it him that broke into this building? He wasn't sure what to do, but he didn't
want the dream characters to find the body. He picked the body up and dragged it towards the closet. He opened it up and pushed the body inside.
Just as he closed the closet the dream characters walked into the room. They looked around the room to see what the thud was. 'Perhaps it was a
cat', one of them said. 'Don't be silly, a cat wouldn't make a sound that loud'. Detective prayed that would walk out and ignore the closet. His
wish was granted. The three of them turned around and walked out of the bedroom - back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Albumin and Detective together watched the camera footage.</p>
<p>Sarah and 6b345 stepped through the steel door at the landing pad. They had made it to Mars successfully. Sarah was now tasked with finding the
ships that had launched and landed on Mars and activating them. She was a little uneasy about 6b345. He original mission was to go to the Moon in
order to find him as there were suspensions that he had been hacked and was acting as a rogue robot. Could the friendly nature he was putting on
just be show?
6b345 scanned Sarah. The readings came up with an unusual high anxiety level. 'Are you feeling OK?', 6b345 asked Sarah as they walked down the
hallways. 'Oh I'm fine', replied Sarah. She stopped holding her head. Sarah experienced a flash vision. It was a scene from Earth. She was with a
man. Their arms were linked. They were standing outside a building door. Rain poured down. In the vision she knocks on the door twice and another
man - someone with a blurred face lets them in.
Sarah is brought back to relatey by 6b345. He slaps her across the face which knocks her out of the flash. 'Sarah I don't think you are well',
6b345 tells her. 'That was the strangest thing ever', Sarah explains. 'Come on, the sleeping bunkers are just up ahead', 6b345 tells Sarah. How
does he know so much about this facility Sarah thinks to herself. Her head still hurts but she continues down the hallway towards the sleeping
bunkers. After everything that had happened, some sleep would be good. The two walked through and sliding door. It was there there were sleeping
bunks and power for 6b345 to charge. 6b345 walked up to the charger and plugged itself in. 8 hours of charge would give it months of charge.
Sarah dropped her bag and climbed into the bed. She was excused and fell asleep immediately. After her sleep the two would go and search for these
80,000 human souls that need to be activated on Mars.</p>
<p>Vanessa stepped up on the escalator. It had been several months since she had been at a tech conference and it always put her in a good mood when
she attended. Being a female meant that she was often gloratized at these events - something she felt a little uneasy about. She had only good
experiences when attending these events. She was warned to watch out for sleazes when she started attending these events. So far she had only good
experiences.
She stood in the line waiting waiting to sign in. The line was around eight people. It was moving quickly. She had printed a bar code out that would
be used to sign in. She was finally at the front of the line. 'Hello, I'm Vanessa May', she told the woman behind the counter. The woman smiled and
said hello. Her bar code was scanned and she was given a lanyard that had her name attached to it. She made her way to the foyer area where coffee,
tea, and juice was being served. The area was full. People were gathered around in their groups chatting among themselves. Vanessa went over to
the group</p>
<p>Loth'Raks scanned the Earth. His ship lay idle
just outside the Earths atmosphere. He was the last
remainder of his race. He had been in search for
other intelligence life and had found it. On this
distant planet that the locals called Earth. He was
uneasy about making himself known to the life. When
<a href="posts/nanowrimo15-day8.html#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">*</span></a>his race had done so before thousands of years ago it
lead to almost their extinction. Loth'Raks was growing
old and needed to pass on knowledge about his race to
these humans in the hope that they may be able to save
him.
He had successfully captured several of the lifeforms
which he was keeping alive in a water like substance.
Unlike his race the humans needed oxygen to survive.
They would never be able to survive on the alien home
planet but he had made it possible for the humans to
breath on Mars, a planet not far from Earth.
He had tested mixing some of his alien DNA with that
of the humans, to see the effects it would create.
The first couple of tests failed but he had just
successfully completed a mix.
Loth'Raks lifted the child from the bed. It's skin was a
faint blue colour - like his own. It's eyes had a cat
like purple and colored blue. It's nose was much more
flat than normal humans. It had a normal human mouth.
Instead of two human arms it had four. Loth'Raks also
had four arms. It had no reproduction system -
something that the humans and his race had very
different. It was a healthy child though. The humans
may never accept him, but they might care for a half
breed - someone part human and part alien.
He would make the humans promise to care for the child
in exchange for the metal that was inside of his race.
It flowed through their body in a liquid form - but
when exposed to oxygen it would turn to a solid. This
meant that Loth'Raks would be unable to survive on Earth,
the insides of his body would harden - killing him. He
had set foot on Earth - wearing a special suit that
stopped his blood metal from hardening. This is how
he had captured the humans.
He was due to expire and had found two humans that were
capable of raising his child - Sarah and Joey McFurson
they were called. They lived on a small farm outside
of Texas. He had organized to meet them to leave the
child. Once the child was safe he would travel back to
his home planet to die. Along with the child he would
leave behind the metal. He had programmed the metal to
malfunction and stop working if any harm would come to
his child.
The child would be able to switch between two forms - a
fully human form and the alien half breed form.
He had shown Joey and Sarah how to switch the child
between the forms, and later when the child is older
they would be able to switch. He named the child Antony. After his grandfather. Loth'Raks stood outside the wooden farm house. He wore
his productive suit in order to stop the oxygen from
contacting his body. In his arms was the small child -
Antony. It was currently in human form. He switched the
child to hybrid form, then back again to human form.
It seemed to work correctly.
He walked forward towards the house. Knocking on the
wooden door. Sarah answered and greeted him in. They
moved to the lounge area. Joey was sitting in a armchair
in the lounge. Sarah had been preparing dinner.
Joey stood up when Loth'Raks walked in the door.
'Is this him', Sarah asked. Loth'Raks had problems
understanding human speech and had installed a
translate device. He got Sarah to hold the device and
speak into it. He replied by nodding.
He handed the child along with the a small caps of the
alien metal to Sarah. He turned and started to walk out
the door. He needed to return to his own planet. Much
longer on this planet would kill him. Sarah and Joey
followed him out the door watching him take off in
his small transport pod. Loth'Raks knew he would never
see them again, but the child would be safe.
Sarah and Joey watched ass the transport pod took off.
The aliens main ship was outside of Earths atmosphere,
but it was too dangerous for the ship to enter.
Loth'Raks made it to his main ship. He docked the
transport pod and exited. He moved quickly to the
control room and started to enter cords for his home
planet. The ship would need to travel through a black
hole in order to get home.
He looked around the ship one last time. Loth'Raks
noticed his ray gun was missing. He had taken it to
Earth in case of trouble. He was sure he had brought it
back on the pod but it was gone. 'What could have
happened to it', he wondered. It was too late though,
he didn't have enough time to return to Earth to
retrieve it.
He just hoped that the gun wouldn't fall into the
wrong hands - the power it would offer the user is
unknown. He tried to forget about it and started the
ships engines. He had located a nearby black hole that
the ship was traveling towards. He strapped himself in
it was always a bumpy ride through a black hole -
something he did not enjoy. He could see the black hole
ahead. The ship was moving towards it. He braced himself
for impact. Shutting his eyes his ship entered the
black hole. A flash of visions happened as the impact
happened. He observed a human man shooting another with
Loth'Raks ray gun. A second vision appeared this time
was of the ray gun being turned into a large weapon.
It was launching attacks on his home planet. The
humans were the ones that had almost wiped out his
race. Was it his fault? Was he to blame for leaving
the ray gun on Earth? He couldn't return. He orbited
his home planet. The black hole had done as predicted
and sent him home. Home to die. The humans must of used the metal he left along with
the ray gun to send the missiles back in time -
thousands of years to wipe out his race. He was annoyed
with himself. Why did he even trust the humans to begin
with? He thought of Antony and how he will grow up
among a race of traitors.
Loth'Raks ship entered his planets atmosphere. It was
traveling fast, and he knew impact was going to be bad,
though not as bad as the experience of traveling the
black hole.</p>

<p>This is the final day of mankind. It happened the day as predicted. The President would give his speech. Joey would be killed in the explosion. The
events that happen when Joey is killed are worse for mankind than it keeping him alive. Detective is sent back again to save Joey. He is in that
time zone 3 times. Different versions of him have different tasks to complete.</p>
<p>Sarah received the artcontrol machine at school. They already were on Mars. The escape from Earth was just a simulation. The moon never exploded.
Earth was fine. Humans could live on Earth. They were tricked into it by advance AI intelligence. The ability to move time backwards and forward.
Sarah goes to space in order to find the metal. Explosion occurs when she is leaving the Moon. Travels to Mars instead of Earth as she loses
contact with Earth. Mars was backup plan if anything went wrong. She had instructions to active the 80,000 human souls being stored on the planet.</p>
<p>Detective searched the crowd for Joey. He would be twelve years old and with his parents. Several times he had attempted to save Joey but each time
failed. Detective had finally worked out that he needed to used a stun gun on both parents in order to get Joey out of there. The perfect time to
reach him in once the first bomb activates. This happens in front of the presidents car. The second explosion hits the crowd. Detective spots Joey.
The first explosion. Detective walks towards Joey. He looks down on him and holds out his hand. He tells Joey that he must come with him.
Detective grabs the child and pulls him to safety. Shortly after getting Joey to a safe spot Detective is pulled back to where he and Antony are
frozen in the room.</p>
<p>Sarah is sent into the future and meets Antony. Humans have successfully returned to Earth. The room is shattered but they use a similar substance
as on Mars to stay alive on Earth.</p>
<p>Sarah travels to Moon when the explosion happens. She sends back Detective from Mars to Earth on the day Humankind was wiped out in order to change
some events. Future version of Detective attempts to kill Sarah
and Joey. It's never sunny and always rains in restored future Earth. The past - Presidents speech is sunny. Moon is gloomy and quiet.</p>
<p>Mars is red/orange. Frozen rivers. Joey looked across the landscape. He had never experienced anything like
it. They raced across the land. Breathing was strange. Air thinner than on Earth. The landing site for the 80,000 humans sent from Earth over 1000
years ago were up ahead. '</p>
<p>Joey would explore the area. Had 3b456 to assist him in finding out what happened. Humans may or may not be active.</p>
<p>Antony makes sure that Vanessa and Joey meet. They have a child - Antony. Detective interferes and attempts to stop Antony from completing his task.
Antony is captured by Detective and uses the time split. Sends Detective back to before the Presidents speech. Sends Antony into future.</p>
<p>Albumin is searching for both of them. When Detective saves Joey from the explosion he is pulled back into the future where he is in the room
with Antony.</p>
<p>Antony is the grandson of Albumin.</p>
<p>Future version of Sarah is on the Moon the day of the Presidents speech. She discovers the alien metal and sends a sample back to the past
before the Presidents speech in order to save Joey.</p>
<p>Sarah gets trapped in the future and can't get back. Joey remarries Vanessa.</p>
<p>Future Detective attempts to kill Sarah and Joey with Ray Gun. He is pulled back to future when he is in the abandoned building with Sarah and
Joey.</p>
<p>Micheal is killed when Moon explodes by drowning. He is in his office when the tidialwave hits the shore. Everything floods.
He watched the sky as the moon shattered. The Earth rocked causing an increase in global temp. Places that were warm - people burnt to death.
Polar caps melted causing worldwide flooding.</p>
<p>Joey and the robot reach the landing site. Sure enough the 80,000 humans had landed and were ready to activate.</p>
<p>Sarah and the robot reach Mars and discover that the 80,000 human didn't make it to Mars. Needs to send back Detective to make sure the launch
happens.</p>
<p>Uganka is killed by Detective when he is hunting down Joey and Sarah. He is shot in the back with Detectives ray gun.</p>
<p>Detective sneaks  around the back of TechFuncMasters he knows of a secret passageway where he can get in. Sneaks up on Uganka as hes about to
unlock the door for Joey and Sarah - but times it badly and Sarah and Joey escape. Detective kills Uganka with the ray gun.
Detective chases after them but loses them. He discovers them when they enter the building he is staying in.
At that point he is pulled into the future where he is in a room with Antony.</p>
<p>ArtControl is in future Mars walking down the road creating artwork on their Raspberry Pi. Breathing in air created from the alien metal.
Electronics are being charged from traces of metal in the air. Ultra fast network speed.</p>
<p>Joey and Sarah had gotten far away from Detective. There was no way that he would catch them by now.
The ray gun that he carried used much more advance tech that what they had in that time. He must have brought it
back with him from the future. Sarah was driving well Joey slept. Joey dreamed of the
events that had happened that evening.
Everything was going as planned. He had received the
private key which he loaded a virus onto it so that the
ships would fail when the ships attempted to leave
Earth.
He had walked down the road in the rain with Sarah. They
had knocked at the door. Uganka was spouse to answer and
let them in. Then they were spouse to experience the time
split that sent them into different time periods.
Instead Detective killed Uganka and attempted to kill
them.
They shouldn't be in this time. Both Joey and Sarah
should be in separate times.
His mind was a fuzz. He couldn't remember where he was
spouse to be traveling. This version of him had experienced
the correct events, but everything changed when
Detective shot Uganka. What was he even doing in this
time? His dreams were puzzling and conditioning.</p>
<p>Sarah looked over and saw Joey sleeping. He looked sweet
when he slept. He must of been dreaming she thought.
He fidged in his sleep. She knew that the events that
occurred tonight were not what was planned. That the two
shouldn't be in this time. What would be the
consequences for staying in this time?</p>
<p>The doctors ran scans on Detectives brain. They had
never seen this type of metal before. Nothing like it
excised on Earth. They had moved him out of the general
hospital and into a govt hospital for special cases.
here he would have the best care and scientists and
doctors together would find out what the metal was.
NASA became involved with the project. They were able
to extract some of the metal out of Detectives brain
and with the sample create a large abadence. They were
unsure about the uses of the metal - but they knew for
a fact that it was helpful for keeping humans alive.
If it wasn't for the this metal substance Detective
would of died when he was hit by the truck.</p>
<p>Even the President became interested in the case. He
visited Detective in hospital and told him about the
great advances in mankind the world would experience
because of Detective nd the metal in his brain.
Detective was finally conscious. He awoke cuffed to the
bed. The room and bed was white. A large 50 inch TV sat
on the bench at the end of his bed. He was connected
with wires. He heard a door open and a woman walked in
wearing a very old styled nurse outfit. 'Perhaps its
a historic dress-up themed party', detective thought to
himself. The woman yelled behind her, 'hes awake'. She
walked towards him. Two doctors followed. They crowded
around the bed where Detective was laying.</p>
<p>One of the Doctors spoke intruding themselves, the
other doctor and the nurse. He explained about the truck
accident and finding the alien metal in Detectives
brain. Detective had no recollection of the events nor
the alien metal found in his brain. It must of been
something that was inserted into new born babies
in the future.</p>
<p>Joey inserted the USB into the computer. Sarah started
to make her wait down the stairs and to the door. She
would wait for him at the door. Joey browsed the USB
file system. launch was the name of the private key.
There was a second file launch.public - the public
key. The public key was loaded onto the servers on the
ships that were bound for Mars. The private key would
allow connection to the ships. Joey typed a command into
the terminal to corrupt the private key. This would cause
the ships to fail. The real key was replaced with the
fake virus infected key. This would cause the ships to
explode when they take off.</p>
<p>All the effect of sending Detective back to load 80,000
people with the metal will be stopped once and for all.
Sarah yelled from downstairs for him to hurry up. He
pulled the USB out of the computer and placed it in his
left pants pocket. He reset the computer and rushed
down the stairs to catch up with Sarah. It was pouring
with rain outside.</p>
<p>Vanessa looked over at Joey. He was scribbling notes into
his pad. She had enjoyed this talk. It was more
entertaining than the technical room. She was enjoying
the stories that the business room offered. It was less
to concentrate on and just absorb the information.
The bank talk finished and moved onto questions. Neither
her or Joey asked a question but several others in the
crowd did.</p>
<p>The slides were all on the same laptop she it meant that
the next talk started 5 minutes after the previous.
The next talk was given by the postal service about how
they are using drones and robots to deliver mail. They
explain how they have replaced the normal postie humans
with robots. They use a GPS data that connects letters
and parcels with where the delivery happens.
They explain how they use machines to scan and sort mail.
They have major depots where the mail is sent then from
there picked up by ground and aerial drones for delivery.</p>
<p>As soon as Detective knows that Joey is safe he gets heads to the nearest payphone. He was visual and practiced this so many times that it had
became a habit. Lead the boy to safely, make the phone call to Albumin that he had captured Antony and to visit us. By this time the current
version of himself will be frozen and sent back. If he doesn't contact her, he may never get back to his own time. The phone rings. and again.
Albumin finally answers. Detective explains to her that he had captured Antony and for her to come to the building immediately.
He is careful not to tell her too much information. He had already experienced these events and if he told her the wrong information everything
they had worked towards could be ruined.</p>
<p>Detectives body dropped to the ground. He had finished
his mission and he had been sent back to his normal
time. The room where he awoke was dark. There was a
man tied up to the chair in front of him. He had no
memory of him and didn't recognize him. The single light
bulb in the room flickered. He looked around to try to
remember where he was. He had been gone for several
years and things might be different in this time line.
He was already experiencing issues with attempting
to remember who this man was in front of him. He stood
up. Suddenly he had a flash. It was of a woman taking
something from him in this room. Did it happen in this
time-line? He thinks to himself.
He walks towards the door. It is a large steel door.
It's closed but unlocked. He walks through the door.
He enters a long hallway which is dimly lit. He
experiences another memory flash. This time of dragging
a body down the hallway. He can't recognize the person
that is helping him with the body - or the body.
Perhaps it's the man tied to the chair? He thinks to
himself.
Detective decides to turn left. He remembers now that
forward would lead him to the building exit.</p>
<p>Turning left leads him to the interview room. It's
empty and looks like its been that way for a long time.
The computer here is covered in dust. The window viewing
shows the man - who Detective still cant remember. He
is still tied to the chair. Detective sits on the seat
and turns on the computer. Perhaps this will give him
the answers he needs. The computer turns on successfully
and he opens the camera history. He rewinds the footage
and watches footage of him and another man dragging the
body of the man tied to the chair into the room. He
watches as the man wakes up and Detective enters the
room. He is holding in his hand a remote device. The
man and Detective talk. The man begins to laugh, and
then they both freeze. He fast forwards the footage.
Pauses when someone else enters the room. It's the
woman from the flash. On camera she looks much older
than in the flash. She does a similar action to the
flash. She takes the remote device from Detectives hand.
Someone else is in the room. Detective notices its the
same man that helped him drag the body into the room
earlier. He watches the footage further. The woman
activates the remote device - causing both her and
the man to freeze for several minutes. 'Did she change
something then', Detective thinks to himself.
He needs more answers about what is going on. He reaches
into his pockets to check for anything. Inside his left
pocket is a red USB that label reads: For Detective.
Detective loads it onto the computer. It has a single
video file on it. He opens the video file up with the video and audio player - VLC. It plays security footage of the room where the man in the
chair is currently. Detective is in the scene as well. He's frozen along with the man in the chair. The woman walks into the room. She injects a
needle into Detectives neck. This footage is different to what was recorded Detective notices. The time-stamps match up. One of the tapes must be
a fake or an alternative time-line. Detective watches the footage further. The woman injects the man tied to the chair with another needle. The
footage ends with the caption. 'Find and Save Joey'. Joey... Detective thinks. That's a name that can remember. He can't picture an image of him.
Maybe Joey is the man tied up?
He exits the room and heads towards the exit. He reaches a large steel door. The front entry and exit to the building. The door is locked but
he unlocks it and opens the door. Detective experiences another piercing headache pain and a flash of events. It shows him walking down this
hallway. Someone is standing at the door inside the building. It's someone new. It's not the man tied up to the chair or the man that helped
Detective tie him up. His face is a blur. It's like he doesn't even have a recognizable face. Detective is holding a ray gun. He points it at the
man and fires. The flash ends. Detective is brought back to reality. A ray gun, he wonders. Where do I get a ray gun? He opens the door.
Outside it's dark and raining. The street is a mess. Detective looks up and down the street. It's empty. Two cars are parked in the car-park. He
heads towards them.
The he tries the car on the left. It's a Red Honda. Locked. Perhaps he will have better luck with the other car - otherwise he might need to
smash a window. The other car is unlocked and Detective climbs into the drivers seat. He starts to take off when he experiences another flash.
This time it's outside the building. He's firing his ray gun at the car he is currently driving. One of the ray guns bullets hits a tire.
Detective is brought back to reality when he notices the car suddenly flip. A wheel had been blown. He was firing at his own vechile.
Detective climbs from the flipped vechile. Luckily he wasn't going fast. He heads back to the other car and smashes the window and unlocks the
door. He hot-wires the car and takes off. He really needs to find someone that can help him understand what is happening. It's just too confusing
for him.
As he drives he sees visions of the other car being driven ahead of him. It's like two worlds mixed together he thinks. He decides to follow this
vision car. He doesn't know who could be driving, but it could give him answers.</p>

<p>The President of the United States addresses the nation and the world. His announcement of successfully sending 80,000 human souls to Mars in order
to preserve mankind. If the events happen as they have been foreseen in the next one thousand years then mankind will be wiped out on Earth and
have to start a new on Mars. The alien metal discovered helps humans breath successfully on Mars. It also helps technology go beyond what we
have today. The time travel possibilities are endless. We are currently looking at sending the metal back further in time - so that we can have
the technology earlier in mankind's existence. Mission launching later today will launch 80,000 human souls into space - destination Mars. It
is unlikely that many of these people will ever return to Earth - instead creating a home on Mars.
Those that return to Earth will be researching into the history of mankind.</p>
<p>Sarah sat on the couch watching the television as the President gave his speech. Clutched in her arms was her teddy - Cuddles. He Mother sat by
her side. Sarah was fascinated with the speech. He was standing on a high bench looking down at thousands of people. During the speech the
television cut off to scenes of unconscious people being loaded onto the ships. These people were lucky to be going to a new planet Sarah thought.
Those left on Earth would not survive. Sarah at her age didn't fully understand what would happen to mankind. As she grew older she would learn.
She squeezed her teddy as the first ship launched off.</p>
<p>Joey watched the Presidents speech from the crowd. He had just had his 12th birthday and as a birthday present his parents had brought him here to
watch live the Presidents speech. He knew it was an important day for mankind. Sending 80,000 human souls to Mars in order to survive the events
that would take place. He watched the president as he held up the piece of alien metal that had been discovered several years ago. It was found
inside a man named Detective who had traces of the metal in his brain. Scientists were able to extract the metal from the brain and create copies.
This metal was able to be used to keep humans alive on earth. It also helped our technology development.</p>
<p>Detective stood behind the President. He had a smile on his face as the President mentioned his name and the developments of mankind. His knowledge
of future events allowed humans to prepare to survive. Without Detective being spent back to the past humankind would be wiped out when the event
known as 'explosion on Moon' occurs. The President asks Detective to make a few words. Detective steps forward towards the mic.
'Hello. Some of you may have heard of me, many of you haven't. I was sent back to this time in order to save mankind. The events that are taking
place today will result in Humankind living on past the end of this world and into others. I am privileged to have a hand in making this happen'.
The crowd erupted with clapping. The president moved forward and gave his closing remarks.</p>
<p>Joey clapped along with the crowd. His Mother and Father side by side. He watched as Detective and the President exited the stage and got into
their vechile, driving off. People chased the car down the road waving and screaming in excitement.</p>
<p>Inside the car Detective and the President sat opposite each other. One of the Presidents men were driving. The president had two decutiry guards
beside him. It was unlikely that anyone would dare attach the car. They had Detective with them. His strength and recovery time was far supurial
than any normal human being. The metal that was found in his brain was inserted into all 80,000 humans being sent to Mars in order to help them
live on the planet.</p>
<p>Ahead on the road was a road block. The men wore orange shirts in order to be seen by traffic. It seemed like a normal road work. One of the
Presidents guards mentioned that there was not spouse to be any road works along the path. Planners of the route had made sure that there would
be no interruptions to slow down the presidents car.
An explosion ahead of the presidents car sent one of the presidents cars flying. Two van pulled up on either side of the presidents car. 6 men
jumped out of the van. This was a planned attack.
The presidents car took off at high speed - attempting to avoid the debree that the explosion had caused. The six men opened fire with automatic
weapons onto the presidents car. The car was built with a metal that could sustain the bullets but still inside the car the president was worried.
The car made it through the area that the explosion happens. Two of the men had jumped into the car and were hanging on as it speed down the road.
One of the security guards wound down the window and started firing shot - only to receive shots back. Detective had been sitting there calmly
but maybe it was time to show these attackers what he was capable of. He undid his seat-belt and climbed out of the open window - pushing aside the
dead bodies of the security guard and attacker. The terrorist was on the roof and opened fire on Detective. His body absorbed the bullets. He
laughed as he walked closed to the man, disarming him and using the weapon - throwing him off the car. The two van were still chasing the car -
with men inside firing automatic weapons at detective. Detective jumped onto a van and fired inside the van. This caused the van to flip and roll.
Detective went flying to the side of the road. He had experienced some bad luck with traffic accidents.
The presidents car kept traveling ahead. Detective lay and watched as the car traveled into the distance. He couldn't move. His body would need
time to recover.
The presidents car reached an intersection when a car pulled out in front of it - letting off an explosion that caused the presidents car to go
flying.</p>
<p>Sarahs Mother returned to the lounge with dinner for her and Sarah. The food was roast duck, potatoes, carrots, and green peas. A blueberry gravy
was squirted over the meat. She sat down next to Sarah and handed Sarah her food.
The two sat and ate their dinner as they watched the President finish his speech and enter his car. An helicopter followed the car as the President
traveled to the space launch. The two watched in horror was the presidents car was attacked. Detective or 'the man from the future', as many called
him saved the president from the attacked. They were saddened to see Detective being knocked to the ground after the first van exploded. The
helicopter camera followed the presidents car. When the car entered an interception there was another explosion - this time causing the presidents
car to roll. 'This isn't a good day for him', spoke Sarahs Mother. Sarah said nothing, she had been ignoring most of what was on television -
focused instead on her food. She loved Duck.</p>
<p>Joey heard an explosion in the distance. People were panicking. He looked around for his parents but they were gone. 'MUM. DAD', he yelled. He
was frightened. Why would they take off like this he thought to himself. A mans hand grabbed him. He looked similar to the man that had just
spoken on stage. 'Come with me if you want to live', the man spoke. 'MUM', he yelled again as this man dragged him towards the exit. Joey goes
with the man. 'He cant be a bad man if he helps the President', he thinks to himself. The mean leads him out of the area. Shortly after he
hears an explosion behind him. The blast had came from the area he was just standing in. If it wasn't for the man leading him out of the area,
he might of been hurt, or worse - killed' Joey thinks to himself. He can no longer feel the mans hand grasping his arm. He looks around but the
man is gone. Then he remembers about his parents. He begins to head back to where the explosion came from. Police have cornered off the area
and he is unable to get back through the barricades. A second later he hears another explosion - this time further up.</p>
<p>Prep the space crafts. Load the passengers. Genders and Races are split evenly between crafts. 50% gender split. Range of professions and ages.
People are picked randomly and put through a screen tester. Time Split device is tested on individuals and anyone immune is refused travel.</p>
<p>The police dragged Vanessa outside and placed her into the back of a patrol car. Students watched as they took off towards to the police station.
Once at the station they grabbed her out of the police car and took her inside the police building for processing. She refused to speak until
her Mother arrived. One of the officers phoned her Mother to get her to collect her. The police had received a tip off that she was planning an
attack on the school, therefore they intervened early and arrested her. No evidence was found for this so they decided to release her to her
Mother. It made the police force look bad when incidents like this happens.</p>
<p>Albumin pulled up outside the police station. Her daughter was being held there on suspected terrorism charges. Albumin knew the chargers were
false and that it was just Antony messing with their lives. She walked inside and went up to the counter. 'I am here to collect my daughter,
Vanessa May', she spoke. The woman behind the counter looked up. 'Can I have your full name, date of birth and address', the woman asks. Albumin
gives her the details. A police officer walks out of the door and asks Albumin to follow him. They walk back through the door her just entered
and down a hallway. The two enter a room where Vanessa is being held. 'No charges were laid but we have to act on information when we receive it',
the police officer apologized. Albumin gave him a dirty look and took Vanessa's hand and marched her out of the building.
Once in the car Vanessa spoke. 'This is your fault Mum', she said. 'If it wasn't for you banning these people we wouldn't have all these issues'.
Albumin sighed. 'I am sorry love', she replied. 'We are working on repairing the problems'. The two then took off in the car.</p>

<p>Detective awoke from the sound of a door slamming. He moved quickly and retrieved his ray gun from beside the bed. He heard people talking in the
kitchen. 'Was it the police, the home owners, or someone else breaking in?', he thought to himself. He moved out of the bedroom and towards the
kitchen, careful to not not be noticed. He peaked around the corner. To his surprise the very people he had been after stood in the kitchen.
Sarah, Joey and an unknown robot who he didn't recognize stood there.
His headache got worse, and he dropped to the ground in pain.</p>
<p>Micheal pulled up outside his exwifes home. Normally she is waiting outside her home for the lift to work. He tooted twice. No response.
'What could she be doing', he thought. It was very strange of her not to let him know if she wasn't going to work.
He turned off the car and climbed out - locking the car after him. He walked up to the front door and knocked twice. No response. He reached
for his cellphone and tried the home line. He could hear it ring inside but no response. He tried her cellphone. It range and she answered.
'Hello Micheal', she spoke. 'Hi, Where are you?', he replied. 'I am at your door waiting for you'. There was a pause. 'Are you there?', he
asked again. 'Oh yes, I'm waiting outside my place like normal', she answered. Micheal looked around and there was no sign of her. 'Is
this a joke', he asked angrily. 'No no, I am here'.</p>
<p>Albumin stood outside waiting for her exhausted Micheal to arrive to pick her up from work. He was running late, it wasn't like him to
to run late. She looked down the street to see she could spot his vehchile. No sign. She heard her home phone inside ring and rushed inside
to answer it. She was too late, the caller had hanged up. She went back out the front. A minute later her cellphone rang and she answered it.
It was Micheal. Apparently he was waiting for her outside her home. Waiting where she was currently standing. She had returned home yesterday
afternoon from Uganka and the issue of Detective and Antony. Perhaps those events mucked up time and she was displaced.
She hanged the the phone up and decided to return to Uganka to see if he had made any progress on locating Detective or Antony.</p>
<p>Their bodies were still frozen. Detective was holding the time split device. Uganka noticed blood running down the forehead of Detective.
'That cant be good', he thought. Reaching for his cellphone he dialed Albumin. She answered. 'Hey, we have a problem here. Detective
seems to be bleeding from the forehead', he told her. 'Yeah, that's really not good', she replied. 'I will be there soon'. Albumin hanged
up the call and dialed another number. 'taxi please', she spoke. Outside she noticed the taxi pull up. She made her way out the front door, locking
it behind her. 'Where to?', the driver asked. She gave the address where Uganka, Detective, and Antony were. The taxi took off. Shortly later they
arrived at the building. She thanked the driver as she exited the vechile. She knocked at the door Uganka let her in and they both walked into the
interview room. The bleeding from Detectives forehead had gotten worse. Uganka had been using cloths to wipe the blood.
Albumin took the time split device from Detectives hand. She examined the device. 'Do you know how this works', She asked Uganka.
'No idea', Uganka replied. Albumin fiddled with the device. The fiddling caused Albumin and Uganka to freeze.</p>
<p>Uganka heard a knock at the door. He answered it. Standing there was Detective with an unconscious body. 'Help me get him in', spoke Detective.
Uganka took one end of the body and they both lifted it into the building. They dragged the body into the interview room. 'Whats his name',
asked Uganka. 'Antony', replied Detective. They strapped Antony's body to a chair in the room and exited the room. They both stepped out the door
and moved to the watching room. Here they both took a seat in the watching room. This allowed them to monitor Antony for when he awoke. Uganka
was tired and began falling off the sleep as they sat there. He switched on the monitor and opened a terminal. The terminal monitored the building
and alerted of any activity.</p>
<p>The 6b345 sat up on the bench. 'We are on Mars?', Joey said in amazement. Walking over to the building he knew something wasn't quite right with
the planet. 'How am I surviving? The air feel like it does on earth', he asks. 'We have developed the air so it is possible for humans to survive
on this planet, after Earth was destroyed Humans needed a new planet to survive on', 6b345 explains. 'Earth is destroyed', Joey gulped. 'Yes,
over 1000 years ago there was an event on Earths Moon that caused Earth to be unlivable to humans', 6b345 explained what happened.
'So is there other humans on this planet', Joey asked. 'There should be, by my calculations I have been offline for 5 years, so events may of
changed, but last time I checked humans were thriving on Mars', 6b345 replied. How exciting Joey thought to himself. Humans surviving on Mars.
'You must take me to these surviving humans', Joey said. 'Very well, but it will be a long journey from here, we are going to need transport'.
6b345 stood up and started walking out the door. 'How are we going to find transport?', Joey ask. 'I will be your transport', replied 6b345.
To Joeys amazement 6b345 transformed into a hovercraft. 'Get on', 6b345 spoke. Joey mounted 6b345 and the two took off into the dusty distance.</p>
<p>Sarah grew up in a small town. It was like any other. Her house was down the block from her primary school. That's where she first discovered
her love of computers. There wasn't allot to do in this town. It had a supermarket, a library, and a small skate park. There were only two
schools - a primary school and a high school. They were only down the street from each other. The streets were clean and houses neat. At
night people stayed inside and the streets were empty. Crime was low. Everyone knew each other.
When Sarah was her first year of school the school got its first ArtControl AI robot. They used it in the art class to help students with
their drawing and painting skills. It was able to create demos that the students learn by copying the demo. After the success of it in the
art classes they purchased more for other subjects - to mimic behaviors. The code running the system was open source so it meant anyone could
contribute to the software.
Sarah remembers the day that her art class opened the artcontrol machine. It was an exciting day, the whole school wanted to be there. Twelve
students, the art teacher and producible gathered around the long plastic wrapped package. The students were allowed together to unwrap. They
pulled back the plastic bubble wrap and undid the cords. The ArtControl Machine lay there lifeless. It needed turned over and the reset button
pushed in order to start's. Sarah was given the honors of powering on the machine. It's eyes blinks green twice and started to make a whirling
sound. The students crowded around as it announced its names and duties. '2g987, art demo and tutor', it spoke. It had the default voice but
the voice was able to be changed to a range of different voices. Its hands could hold a pencil, pen, paintbrush, or palette knife in either
hand. It was possible to mix and match the art tools.
The children were excited to see 2g987 produce its first artwork. They had setup an easel and wooden board for the first painting. 2g987
asks what they would like painted. There are a range of answers - create an original piece from memory reference, draw from life, or a combo
of both. The students decided on a original piece from memory reference. The next option was the style of the painting. Again this was a range
of choices to choose from. There was a range of artists they could choose from - old masters such as Willem Kalf, Canaletto and Leonardo da Vinci.
The range was limitless. 2g987 also had the ability to scan a painting or drawing and produce an original work in a similar style. The students
choice Leonardo da Vinci. 2g987 got to work straight away - first sketching in pencil, then applying a gray-scale layer, and finally colour.
The students steered and watched in amazement at how quick 2g987 worked. Within a few minutes the painting was finished. 2g987 stood back. It
seemed proud of this first painting.
The bell rung and the students all ran from the room. Sarah stayed and examined 2b987. She brought her hand up and touched it's fake plastic face.
It smiled. It's green eyes blinking 3 times. It was the first of its kind to be used in classrooms. Future versions of it would take over the whole
classroom, including the students. Engineering the perfect education resource machine. That's what it was about. Creating the perfect machine to
create open resources. It had a Creative Commons logo tattooed to its arm. CC BY 4.0. It read. The meta data that it created was stored online as
part of an API. Everything the machine saw and did was documented. It's about creating whatever you consider a education resource.</p>
<p>ArtControl walked down the street. He held in his left hand a Wacom pen and on his right arm a Wacom drawing tablet. Sitting on this tablet was
a Raspberry Pi computer. This had a monitor attached to it. It was being powered by a USB. Attached to the Raspberry Pi was a power pack, and the
Wacom tablet. When the new oxygen was developed to keep humans alive on mars they used a chemical melted down to allow wireless charging. The
Raspberry Pi was being charged with oxygen out of the sky.</p>
<p>The internet connection was everywhere. The speeds were 10gb a second download and 1gb upload. Their was an unlimited amount of usage. The Pi was
being developed to include a wireless card. Older version of the Pi didn't have a wireless card.</p>
<p>Antony sipped his cup of herb tea. It was hot so he placed it on the counter to cool down. Sarah sat in the chair.

<p>Detective held the time split device in his right hand. He watched Antony as he squirmed in his seat. Suddenly Antony stopped squirming and began
laughing historirocy.
Alarm bells sounded which blocked out the sound of Antony's laughter. 'What is this', shouted Detective. 'You will never find me', yelled back
Antony. The alarm stopped. Everything stopped. Both Antony and Dective froze. For a moment in time, the world stopped. Then everything went
back to normal except for Antony and Dective. They stayed frozen.</p>
<p>Antony awoke in a dusty hut. He had no memory of how he got here. The last thing he remembers is being tired up to a chair and having Detective
talking to him. 'How did I get away', he thought to himself. He looked around the hut to get an idea for where he is. In the corner of the room
lay-ed an old artcontrol robot body. It looked like a prototype edition from over 50 years ago. 'I wonder if it will still work', Antony thought.
He moved towards the robot to examine it closer. The series number on the machine said 6b345. He turned it over, noticing that the battery
was fried. 'Maybe I could repair it'. He dragged the robot outside the hut. Outside it was raining. The view was like nothing he had seen before.
Bright purple colour rose from the distance. The waves crashed onto the beach. Antony continued to drag the robot along the beach. In the distance
he noticed an old industrial building that may have the tools to repair this robot.</p>
<p>He reached the building. The door was a large steel door. Antony tried the door and it opened up. He dragged the robots body inside the building.
He was happy to get out of the rain. The building was large. He could hear the rain on the tin roof. Old tools scatted the ground. Tables and
chairs were broken. Antony dragged the robot towards a table and sat down. It was an effort moving the robot. He searched around for anything
that he could use to repair the robot. Sure enough he found a battery pack that he was able use use. He used a screwdriver to remove the old
fried pack and inserted the new pack. The front light switched on - turning green. The robot began to make a whizzing sound as it powered up.
'Mission Sarah Rescue Complete', he spoke in its robotic voice. Antony smiled with amazement as it started to move. It stood up and started to
move forward. It didn't seem to notice Antony. 'Hey You', spoke Antony. 'Command Now', the robot spoke. 'I am 6b345, what is your command'.
'Where are we', Antony spoke. 'You are on planet Mars, it is the year 3532, month June, day 34', 6b345 answered.</p>
<p>Humans fully colonized the planet Mars after a disaster happened on Earth which wiped all living species. Before the disaster hit they had
a supply of humans preserved on Mars that were active in order to maintain human existence.
The biggest problems they had with life on Mars is the lack of oxygen. They did have problems with supply but have since setup enough of a base
on mars to supply without the help from Earth.
Plans were made for humans to travel back to Earth in order to retrieve important items. Earth was unlivable but the humans were able to spend
a short time on the planet in order to get the items. The time split device had been left on Earth and it was important to retrieve it. Humans
would never be able to survive for long on Mars and they needed to change events in order to stop the moon from splitting.</p>
<p>Joey stood and watched as they went over to the</p>
<p>Joey is sent to Mars when the time split happens. What happens to Detective when the time split happens?</p>
<p>Detective awakes in a green grass field. He had never experienced anything so beautiful in life. His whole life the world had been gray and black.
The sun was shinning. 'Was this even Earth', he thought. He had heard tales of an ancient earth where the world hadn't been destroyed.
Before the ArtControl machines took over. In the distance her saw a building which looked like a shopping complex.
Crowds of people were walking in and out of the building. A road ran down the side where people were driving cars.
Dective had never seen these kind of cars before, he had seen photos of them when he was a child. The cars had four wheels and required a
driver to manually control. Dective headed towards the road. Maybe someone could help him, he thought. He reached the road and started to cross
the road. He crossed in front of a truck, which hit him and sent his body flying. The truck sketched to a halt. People crowded around his body.
Detective was barely alive but an ambulance sirens were in the distance heading towards the scene.
Two ambulance pulled up and jumped from the vechile. The asked everyone to move back from the body before examining it.
They moved the body onto a stretcher and took it towards the hospital.
There was a chance that the man would survive. The ambulance flashed their lights and sirens as they rushed towards the hospital.
They pulled up outside the building hospital and rushed the stretcher and body inside emergency.
The mans  body was heavy damaged, beyond what a normal human being would need to survive.
As the doctors examined the patient they discovered a metal like substance in the patiats brain. It was used to control his actions, and keep him alive. They had never experienced anything like it before. On of the doctors had a contact at NASA that researched alien life forms.
The doctor made contact with them in case they were able to shred some light on the issues.</p>
<p>Sarah was chosen along with Joey and 6b345 to go back to Earth in order to find the devices.</p>
<p>Sarah ship circled the Earth. She had lost communication with Earth after the explosion of the Moon. It would of caused a ripple effect that
knocked the Earth out of orbit, killing all lifeforms. She had a backup plan of traveling to Mars where she would be able to activate the
80,000 humans that were stored on the planet. On the computer she put in cord's for Mars and her ship took off at light-speed.</p>
<p>Several minutes later she found herself circling the red planet of Mars. She had only ever been to Mars when she was little with her family.
Humans had been creating a colony for years on the planet and had made a base that was able to sustain human life.
It was a rough ride as her ship entered Mars atmosphere. She landed on the docking station. After landing she exited her ship. She was able to
take off her spacesuit as the base had oxygen that allowed humans to breath. The air was thinner than what she was use to on earth and it took
her several minutes of breathing to adjust.
She heard a notice from inside her ship. 'Was someone else on my ship', she thought to herself. She reached for her ray gun and boarded the
ship to investigate the problem.</p>
<p>6b345 checked his co-ords. The Lang and long were off. The system searched for the cord's and returned that they were on Mars - not Earth.
This could be a problem. He started to move his ways off the ship when they heard the ships door open and Sarah board the ship again.
She was equipped with a ray gun. She must of heard something when   6b345 was moving around the ship. There was no where for him to hide.
Instead raised hands and stood still waiting for her to enter the supply room.</p>
<p>Sarah peaked around the corner into the supply room. She had spotted what what making the noise. It was a robot with it's hands up.
'How the hell did you get on this ship', Sarah spoke as she moved around the corner - Ray gun pointed at the robot. 'There is nothing
to worry about', the Robot spoke. 'I am 6b345 and here to help you. I boarded the ship when you were on the Moon'. Sarah lowered
her Ray gun. 'A friendly robot, that's rare', she replied. 'I am Sarah, pleased to meet you', Sarah said as she held out her hand to
shake 6b345s hand. They shock and then exited the plane together.</p>
<p>'My calculations estimate that there is enough oxygen to last for the future', 6b345 tells Sarah. They both make their way down the platform.
Ahead of them is a large steel door. They move forward. 6b345 hesitates. 'You are not a scary cat', Sarah laughs. 'No, I'm just picking up
some unusual readings', replies 6b345. 'Are you sure this place is safe?'.</p>
<p>Uganka stood at the door waiting for the knock. It was important that Sarah and Joey arrived on time. They had gone to retrieve a private key
that would allow the time split device to activate. It was very experimental and hadn't been tested before. Uganka was about to give up when
he head a knock. 'Who's there', he spoke. 'Sarah and Joey Macfurson', a female voice spoke. It must of been Sarah thought Uganka. He started to
unlock the door when behind him he heard footsteps. He turned around to find a solid man pointing a ray gun at him. The man fired the gun knocking
Uganka to the ground.
Outside Sarah and Joey heard a gun shot. They backed away from the door. 'This cant be right', spoke Sarah. 'Something has changed, he was meant
to answer that door and let us in'. 'Lets get out of here', suggested Joey as they turned around and started to run down the road. They found an
abandoned car which they were able to hot-wire. Joey was in the drivers seat and Sarah in the passenger. An old artcontrol robot model was lying
across the back seat. Joey reversed up and took off. They watched as a man stepped out of the door and started firing on them. Joey slammed on
the alzarater and speed down the road - avoiding the burning car parts in the way. 'What the hell happened there', asked Joey. 'We are spouse to be
inside that building'. Sarah shrugged. She was just as confused as Joey.
The two continued driving down the road. The rain had gotten heavier. Sarah moved to the back of the car to examine the artcontrol robot.
'What kind of condition is he in', asked Joey. Sarah flipped the robot over and checked his battery pack. 'It seems fine, just needs a reset',
Sarah replied. She reached for the reset button and pushed it in for 3 seconds. The robot started to power up.</p>
<p>Detective stood over the dead body of Uganka. One ray gun blast to the chest had killed him. He moved towards the door and started to unlock it.
He heard a car starting up outside. He stepped outside with armed with his ray gun. He fired three times at the car but missed and the car was too
far away now. Detective had stopped Sarah and Joey from entering the building. How this would change the future he was not sure, but having them
enter the building would be devastating. He needed to hunt them down and kill them.
His head hurt from the headaches. Since the accident his body hadn't been the same. He had some of the best doctors and scientists repair him. His
hand reached for his pills in his pockets. He swallowed two down. These pills helped keep him alive.
Devtive made his way down the street and found an old car that he was able to hot-wire and start. The car was full of rubbish, old soft-drink bottles
and food. He started to drive down the road in the same direction that Sarah and Joey had traveled.
He traveled several blocked before giving up. He wasn't going to find them in a city this big. He could sleep in one of these old apartment
buildings and in the morning hunt for them. He pulled the car over and made his way over to a building. The building was clearly empty - wooden
planks covered the windows and door. He searched for something that would allow him to break the door down. He found a piece of steel nearby that
he used to smash the door. He entered. The lights switched on. It looked like the people that lived here left in a hurry. Lunch was served on the
table. Fly's swarmed the food. He moved towards the kitchen. The fruit in the fruit painter was still good. He ate a banana and headed towards
the master bedroom. The bed was made and had fresh sheets. He climbed into the bed and feel asleep. He was excused.</p>

<p>Joey watched as crowds of people hoovered the morning tea table. The food was sweet fresh cream buns and savory muffins. He scanned the area for an
exit. This was too many people for him to handle. He noticed a door leading to a balcony on the far side of the room. He would have to make
his way through several groups of people. He took a deep breath and provided to walk towards the door. One step in front of another.
'excuse me', he spoke as he made his way past the group.
He finally reached the door and squeezed through the part opening.
Outside on the balcony he felt better. The room felt crowded but out here there was room. The sun was shinning and Joey was able to find a seat
and started to eat his cream bun.
techfuncmasters was the company hosting the conference. It was a three day event where business and technique people from a range of companies
got together and shared and collaborated on ideas. The name of the conference was api days.
Joey was a contractor and had just started a new project of developing some addons for gimp. The addons that he had to build was to make it
possible to give the computer a collection of digital paintings, and the video process of the paintings - and a blank canvas. The computer
would then mimic the original painting - creating a new painting with help from a new reference image. Joey wasn't sure who he was creating
this software for - but it didn't really matter. The main thing for joey was that he was getting paid well - and that the addons would be
open source.</p>
<p>Joey heard steps behind him. He was no longer alone out there. A woman in her 20s approached and sat near him. She too had came outside to eat
the morning tea. Joey checked her name tag. Vanessa May, TechFuncMasters, Developer, it read.
'Hi there', spoke Joey after he finished the mouthful of cream bun.
'Hi, How are are', Vanessa replied. 'I'm great, enjoying the conference, some great keynotes. I'm Joey'. Joey shock Vanessa's hand.
'Vanessa', she replied.</p>
<p>Antony watched as Joey and Vanessa meet. It was as predicted. History had told that these two would meet this day. October 14th 2065 at
10:50am. Antony knew his job was done and started to walk out of the building. The place was crowded as he started to push his way to the
exit.
'sir, wait', he heard a voice behind him. He ignored it. It was important that he got out of the building in the next 5 minutes. He kept
moving, at a faster pace. 'STOP', the voice yelled. Antony started to run. The last thing he remembers is a buzzing sound. Then darkness.</p>
<p>'So where do you work', Vanessa asked Joey. His badge read Joey McFurson. The company line was blank. His role was set to Developer.
'Oh i am doing some contract work currently. Mostly image manipulation kind of stuff', Joey replied.</p>
<p>The light flickered as Antony opened his eyes. He was strapped to a chair. His mouth gagged to stop him from yelling. The room was small.
A table was in front of him along with a similar chair. On the table was a bunch of medical and electrical devices.
'What the hell', he thought to himself. He heard a door open. In walked a solid built man in his 40s. He had long black hair, brown eyes,
and walked with a slight limp. The man sat down in front of Antony. 'I am Detective'. Do you know why you are here?', he asked.
Antony sighed, 'I have no idea'. 'The agency I work for tracks down those that are involved in time alteration events'.
Antony realized he was in trouble. How the hell did they find him, he thought to himself. 'I want a lawyer', he replied.
'You do not have a right to a lawyer Antony', Dectecive spoke. 'Just tell us what you know, we can do this the easy way, or the headway'.
Antony maintained a puzzled look on his face. 'Antony, Do you know what this device is', Detective picked us a circle electronic device
from the table. 'No comment', spoke Antony.</p>
<p>Joey checked his watch, it was 10:58. The crowds of people had finished their morning tea and moved back into the speakers rooms. Joey
had been in the tech track but decided to switch the business track. He had found the tech track to be slightly boring, and was dozing
off during the session.
He stood up from his seat on the balcony and moved towards the door, sliding it open further to get inside. He headed towards the room
which had the sign: 'business track'. The room was much smaller than the tech track. He found himself a seat on the side of the room.
He sat down and retrieved his pad and pen to take notes. The next talk was from a bank - the first talk of the day from a woman.
Vanessa watched as Joey got a pad and pen from his bag. She made her way towards him and took a seat next to him. 'Hi', she spoke.
'Hello', he replied. She reached for her bag and go out a laptop. 'oh wow, you brought a laptop, isn't that kinda dangerous', Joey
remarked. 'It's a throwaway machine', I'm going to destroy it after the conference', Vanessa replied.
Joey watched as Vanessa's web browser opened. She had several tabs of Jupyter Notebook running. She was using it to take notes in
markdown format. 'I just stick with pen and paper, less to worry about', spoke Joey. 'Fair enough', replied Vanessa. Their
conversation was interrupted with the announcement of the next speaker.</p>
<p>Albumin receive the call from Detective. They had had found Antony. She made her way from her home office to her front door.
Detective had told her that a car would be picking her up in 30seconds to take her to where they were holding him. She had been
involved in the search for him in years. Ever since they retrieved information that he was the one that caused a time split that
meant Vanessa never meet Sarah. It was important for Albumin that they meet as it leads to the fail of the ArtControl system
that everyone had been involved in developing.
Rain poured down as Albumin stood in her driveway. She watched as a car came down her street slowly. 'This has to be it', she
thought to herself. It stopped outside her home and the backdoor opened. She climbed in.
The car was old. A 2015 Honda. It is rare to see these cars around. Majority of people use cars that are self driving. I guess they
don't want to use new tech that the govt tracks. These old methods of transport are safer. The car struggled but made its way down
the dirt road, turning left. The streets were quiet. People were too scared to come out of their home at night. The crime in the
city had increased in the past twenty years. Albumin was partly to blame, she had been issuing orders to police to break down
peoples houses in search for Antony. Now they finally had him focus could go into getting information out of him. It wouldn't be
easy.
The car pulled up outside an old abounded building. TechFuncMasters the old sign read out the front. Albumin stepped out of the
car. She stepped forward and the car took off. The rain was calming as she moved toward the front door. She knocked twice. It was
a large steel door that read: number 6 TechFuncMasters.
Uganka answered the door. They walked down the hallway and turned left. Reaching another steel door. 'How did you find him?',
Albumin asked. Uganka was silent. He just unlocked the steel door and pushed Albumin through.
The room was dark except for a single light bulb. In one chair a man was strapped, Dective was sitting opposite holding the time split
device. A table separated them. They were both frozen in time. 'You must be Antony', Albumin spoke. 'We have been searching
for you for a long time'. The two were still frozen. 'UGANKA', yelled Albumin. The steel door opened and Uganka walked in.
'Yes', he spoke. 'What the hell is happening here, can you get them back to normal', she asked. 'I thought you would know how to do
that', Uganka replied. 'No I don't' Albumin snapped. 'We finally get this guy and now I cant even interview him. I need to see the
security tapes'. 'Yes, follow me', Uganka leads Albumin out of the steel door. He closes it after him. They walk forward and to
the left where there is another steel door. Uganka unlocks the door and they both step in. The server room. The brains of the building.
In front of them is a desk with a old computer monitor that is displaying live footage of the events the interview room.
'I want to see footage of the past 24 hours from that room', Albumin demands. 'Yes', replies Uganka as he rewinds the footage of
the day.
The footage shows Detective and Uganka dragging the body of Antony into the room. They both tie him up and leave. Albumin fast
forwards the footage. She wants to see the conversation the two have together and what happens after the phone call to her is made.
She pauses the footage as Antony wakes up. The buzzer goes off to let Dective know that he is away. A few minutes later Detective walks into
the room and the two have a conversation. Sadly the footage wasn't able to catch audio. After a short convoy Dective shows Antony the time
split device and they both freeze. 'Hang on', says Albumin. 'Somethings not right. Where is it that Dective places the phone call to me?',
Albumin wonders. She reviews the footage again. Puzzled she asks Uganka to show her the interview room again.
Antony and Dective are still frozen. Albumin exams the bodies. 'Perhaps it wasn't this Dective that made that phone call', she thinks to
herself. 'Maybe something happened with the time split and the call was sent by an alternative Dective'. She had heard of similar things
happen but never experienced it herself.</p>

<p>Sarah heard the jug boiling from behind the door. She had just showered, rinsing the blood from her body. Antony had given her some clothes
that belonged to his ex-wife. Antony's wife had been in a terrible accident and passed away. Antony had never remarried but instead focused on
his work. Shortly after his wife's death he was hired to develop software to develop code for to get the computer to paint lines. Antony was
a specialist in writing code for graphics. Antony never meet the man who contracted him. All the code was uploaded to a server. He was given
a private key to connect to. When the code was uploaded to the server it is moved off the server and original content deleted.</p>
<p>Antony opened the pantry cabinet. He was hungry but wasn't quite sure what to make. Noodles seemed like a good choice.</p>
<p>Sarah opened the steel door and steeped into the room. Antony was standing in front of the cubard. He seemed to be deciding on something
to cook. 'Take a seat', he spoke. 'Thank you', Sarah replied, moving towards the table and chairs. 'You must be starving, is there anything
in particle you feel like?', asked Antony. 'Yes I am hungry, whatever is fine', Sarah replied. 'Fried noodles it is then', Antony reached
for the Japanese style noodles. 'Cut two onion', he spoke. A metal mechanical arm with a knife attached to the end on the bench started to
cut up two onions. 'auto fried noodles'. 'fried noodles started', replied the machine. Antony moved towards the table where Sarah was sitting.
'I will let the machine take care of dinner so we can talk', Antony remarked as he took a seat opposite Sarah. 'I will like you to explain
all events you can remember from the past twenty four hours', Antony asked Sarah. He took out a pad and pen.
'Where to begin', Sarah replied.</p>
<p>Sarah looked back at the Earth from the capsule. She was being sent to the moon on a mission to recover prototype 6b345 ArtControl. System
control had lost contact with it during a recent mission. It had been with 5 other prototype ArtControl machines exploring craters of the moon
before its radio-signal failed. It was suspected that its system had been taken over by a hacker and it was being remotely controlled by someone
on Earth. This was dangerous as this particle machine was designed with nuclear capabilities.
Sarah closes her eyes as she exited the Earth atmosphere. The ship she was traveling over was running the AI ArtControl system headless. This
allowed for ArtControl to control the ships functions so that the crew were able to relax. This cut down the risk of mistakes as ArtControl
was designed to not make a mistake.
Once on the moon Sarah would carry a Raspberry Pi computer hooked to her life support that would assist her on the mission to retrieve prototype
6b345. The Pi was running the AI Artcontrol.
Sarah stepped out of the pod. The her suit had been modified to allow her to walk on the moon with similar gravity to that of Earth.
20 meters in front of her she spotted the moon buggy. This was going to be used to get to the crater where system control last had contact
with 6b345. The buggy was equipped with GPS that would be controlled by ArtControl to take her to the crater.
She started moving towards the buggy. 'Sarah, this is system control', came a voice on her headset. 'confirm, This is Sarah', she replied.
'We notice you have arrived and exited the pod, status update' the voice asked. 'Everything is fine, moving toward the transport'.
'Roger that, ArtControl will take over once you reach the transport, system control out'. The transmission ended.
Sarah continued moving towards the transport. After finally reaching the transport she climbed into the seat. It was a single pod that had
been designed to move over the toughest conditions - perfect for the rocky texture of the moon.
Sarah reached for the Raspberry Pi from her belt and connected it to the transport.
The Pi switched on with the power given to it from the transport. The monitor in front of Sarah switched on. Bios loaded, and the kernel
booted. Once the operating system was loaded the transport began moving forward. Sarah strapped herself in as it began to speed up.</p>
<p>In a distance the prototype 6b345 ArtControl watched the transport zip across the moons surface. 6b345 stood still, knowing the humans
would not be able to find it.</p>
<p>3km till destination the monitor display. Estimated time of arrive: 45 seconds. Sarah could see the crater now that they gotten closer.
The transport started to slow down. It stopped just before reaching the crater. Destination reached the monitor displayed. Sarah unbuckled
her belt and climbed out of the transport. She moved into the crater. The place was a mess. Scraps of metal were lying around. She reached for
the camera in her belt and started to document the evidence. Something had happened her and it was her job to figure it out.
She moved deeper into the crater. What is this metal? She thought to herself, it was nothing like they had on Earth. It must of been some
sort of alien technology. Sarah bent over and gathered some of the metal depree into a evidence bag. Scientists back on Earth will analyze
this. It may shred some light on what happened to 6b345.</p>
<p>6b345 watched as the human gathered evidence from the site. It had activated its camo that rendered it invisible to the human eye.
It watched as the human placed an object into a bag. 'Sarah, this is system control', a voice blasted. 'We are getting some crazy
radio signals from your position, status update please'. The human lifted her arm towards her ear. 'Sarah', 6b345 thought to itself.
It loaded its database of human personal. 'Sarah Clarkson, 27 years old, American', The database showed. 'More detail', 6b345 loaded
more detailed information. 'Born New York December 15th 2021 at 5:32am to Danny and Mary Clarkson. Attended New York State School from
ages 5 till 17, studied computer science in New York University for 4 years. Currently working for NASA as a AI developer.'
6b345 shutdown the report.</p>
<p>A sharp bass notice blasted in Sarah ear. 'System Control, was that you', asked Sarah over her mic. 'Sarah, This is mission control.
We did not transmit, is there a problem?', replied system control. 'hmm strange, it was a bass sound happening in my headset', Sarah
remarked. "I'm done here, heading back to the pod". Sarah turned around and headed towards the transport. She needed to head back to
the pod and return to Earth with the evidence she had gathered. She reached the transport that would return her to the pod.
The process was the same as before - she took the Raspberry Pi from her belt and attached it to the transport. The monitor booted up
and transport turned around - heading towards the pods location.</p>
<p>6b345 held on to the transport as it started to move towards the pod. They were planning on traveling on the ship with Sarah. The camo
was running out of power though so it may need to hide in the pod during the return trip to Earth. This could cause issues if Sarah noticed
him on board. There was enough power to get on the pod and take off, which is the important.</p>
<p>Sarah pulled up at the pod. She dispatched the Raspberry Pi from the transport and unstopped herself. She was still getting a strange
bass sound from her headset. She moved towards the pod and took off.</p>
<p>As she was exiting the moon there was a large explosion. She looked down in horror to see that the moon had split, creating several
parts of the moon. The parts were attached only just, but this couldn't be good for Earth. The effects this would have on Earth would
be devastating. Maybe she wouldn't be able to return to Earth. Mars was an option - Humans had set up a base on the planet in case
something ever happened. It was mainly run by ArtControl machines but several hundred humans were preserved there as a backup for
humankind.</p>
<p>6b345 had curled into a small cube to fit inside the pod. They had made their way into the supply and inventory area where hopefully
they wouldn't be noticed. To preserve power they switched off the camo and would switch it on if someone entered the area or once
they landed back on earth.</p>

<p>this is a great script editer! I am testing this.
Hello from the otherside!</p>
<p>This is my novel for November 2015.</p>
<p>The clock had struck midnight. The single light bulb flickered. His fingers clicked the keys. Eyes moving back and forward on the screen. Private
returned an error. There was no way he believed this was happening. The private key was broken and meant he wasa unable to connect to the server.
Something had happened and the key had became corrupted. Perhaps he needed a break. When crap like this happened the best option was to walk away.
He stood up from this chair. Taking a long sigh he walked towards the door. The muscles on his thighs stang. The long was he had taken eariler that day
had taken a toll on his body.</p>
<p>He switched the jug on. Tapping his feet. 'I need some music he thought'. Reaching in his pocket he pulled out his Samsung cellphone. It was running
a modified version of Debian. Unlocking the phone he tapped the music icon. A list of stations appeared. 'oh the choices', he spoke. 'Who are you talking
to hun', a voice came from another room. A woman walked into the room. 'Oh Hi Babe', he spoke. I didn't hear you return - 'how was work?'.
Sarah stepped out of her office. The rain poured. 'Joey are you coming?', she yelled over her shoulder. ' one moment, just cleaning up', Joey replied.
Joey scrambled down the stairs to catch up with Sarah. She was holding the door open for him. ' Sorry about that, needed to finish off corrupting
that private key', he told Sarah. 'Did it work?', she replied as they both stepped into the rain. Joey nodded as they began walking down the street
together.</p>
<p>The sky was turning black as they continued to walk down the road together, arms locked together. The streets were deserted. Old cars were burning on
the street. Sirens scretched in the distance.do you thin thy are coming for us, joey asked sarah. ' There are bigger problems for the police to
deal with than us', sarah replied. careful, watch your step, she added. A burning bumper from a vehile lay on the path. The two carefully steped over.
Not much further to go, joey said. 'It's just around this corner'. The two walked around the corner and turned into a narrow alleyway. They walked
past several abanded building before reaching a door which read: number 6 techfuncmasters.</p>
<p>'This is it', Sarah wispered. She raised her hand and gave two solid knocked on the door. They heard movement inside as someone moved towards the door.
'whos there', a voice spoke. 'Sarah and Joey Macfurson', spoke sarah. The door crecked open. A man in his mid 40 stood.in front of them. He was
tall - 6 foot 5 with a long brown beard and blue eyes. His head was saved. He wore circal glasses. ' i am Uganka ', he spoke in a eastern european
accent. He held his hand out and shook both Joeys, followed by Sarahs hands. 'it is nice to meet you finally ', Joey said as he shook Uganka's
hand with a strong grip. 'Please come in out of this rain', Uganka greeted them into the building. The two stepped into the door. 'Please follow me',
Uganka spoke as he started to was down the hall way. Saray and Joey followed the man, arms still linked together.</p>
<p>They reached the end of the hall and stopped at a steel door. Uganka stopped. ' Is something wrong? ', Sarah asked. 'This is your last chance to leave',
spoke. Uganka. 'ther is no turning back from here'. 'no we wnt to do this', both Joey and Sarah spoke. 'very well', uganka spoke as he unlocked the
steel door. They walked into a room that was pitch black. Sarah grabbed Joeys arm in fear. ÃÂ­ts ok, joey wispered.  The steel door behind them slammed
shut and they both jumped. Purple and red lazers starting wizzing around. 'Where is Uganka', asked Joey. The man that had lead them into the room
was gone. A wizzing noice started. Growing louder, andd louder. Sarah and Joey let go of each other and held their hands to their ears. Along with
the wizzing sound increasing a new sound began - sirens. The two dropped to the ground. Sarah was the first to screem and started moving in a
circle motionon the ground. Joey started screaming shortly afterwards.  The sound was deafening. Suddently the room flashed with lightning as the noise
stoppeed. The room returned to norma lighting, but the room was empty. Both Sarah and Joey had vanished.</p>
<p>The light flicked as Antoney lay back on his comoputer chair. On his left monitor he has the latest epoise of the telvison show 'Linus'. On his
central monitor had a web browser open with a IPython Notebook running. The right monitor had test resultsbeing displays. Three terminal windows,
all displaying results of his code changes. CCTV monitors hovered above these three monitors. This kept an eye on other rooms in the building along with
outside and views from the street. He had tapped into the cities traffic cameras and was getting a realtime feed of the surounding street. Should
any trouble head his way - he would know and be able to make a quick exit.</p>
<p>alert: inruder in section 31 spoke a voice. Antoney glanced away from the television show to the cctv monitors. 'switch to room 18', he spoke.
Thee monitor zoomed in on a camera in room 18. 'hmm, that stange', antoney thought to himself. The room looked normal. 'Maybe Ineed to check it out
myself', he rose from his chair and started walking towards the steel door. He unlocked it and walked in. The room was pitch black. 'somethings
wrong', he spoke. 'This. can't be happening'. Lights switched on and everything was normal. 'So strange', he spoke.
Antoney caucioly walked through the room heading toward room 18. He peaked around the hallway corner. Empty. He started walking down the hallway.
Suddenly he heard a womans screem and frooze. 'Who the hell is there', he yelled. Now he knew there was an inruder. He reached for his handgun
in his pouch. He was armed and ready. i have a gun', he warneddd. the intruder as he contined walking towards the screem. He reached the door. The
letters 18 read on it. im going to enter, he warned. Gun drawn he busted the door open.</p>
<p>A woman lay in the center of the floor. She was naked and covered in blood. 'Who are you, and how did you get in here', Antony asked the woman. He
lowered his weapon and creeped lcloser to the woman. At thihs point he had relised she was no harm. Her screaming stopped as she noticedd him.
'i am sarah', she spook. She leapt from the ground and wrapped her body around Anttony. He was a little shocked to have this woman suddenly
over him. In his arms she sobs. 'now,  now, he spoke, pating him on the back. he gently pushed her off him, moving her to an office seat.
'lets find you a blanket', he said. He spots a rugs that he wraps around you.
'How did you get here', Antony asks Sarah. Still shacking she repied with, 'The last thing I remember is purple and red lights'.
'hmm, interesting', spoke Antony. 'What is todays date?', asks Antony. 'The date..', Sarah pauses. 'It is November 21st 2065'.
Antonys draw drops. 'You believe the year is 2065?'. Sarah gives him a confused look. 'Sarah, it's the year 3532'.</p>
<p>Antony switched on the jug and started making him himself a coffee. As he poured the water a voice apeared from behind him.</p>
<p>Joey typed on the keyboard. S.T.A.R.T.S.Y.S.E.M. Return. The machines main led light switched to green. A wirling sound begins as the machine
starts up. Joey fixes his glasses as he nervously waits to see if the boot happens. He had tested it and all the tests had passed. The bios
had finished loading and the machine was booting the kernal. This was the most progress the machine had done. Scientists had worked for years
to develop this machine. The room was airgapped and blocked all radio signals. This was to stop interference from any outside source. Crackers
had attempted to modify the machine so it was imported that it was kept secure. The building it was stored in was on the 10th floor of the building,
inside another building. Large fenced surrounded each of the builds with turrets to shoot anything that moved.
It was not posible for anyone to reach the machine. Even the machine that Joey was controling wasn't the real machine but was instead sending off
signals to the real machine. This meant if the fake machine was comporomised then the true machine would still be safe.</p>
<p>The handed on the clock ticked over to three thiry two. LED lights on the panel displayed the year November 21st 2065. Twenty percent of the time
the machine got the time collabration correct but from time to time an error accured.</p>
<p>Linus stood in front of the crowd. A grin on his face and a laptop under his arm. The television show 'Linus' had just won awards for the best
Drama and Linus had won an award for best actor. He didn't feel much like an actor. He waved as the crowd cheered. Cameras flashed. Linus bowed
and posed for the camera. One of his security personal whispered into his ear, 'sir we need to move'. Linus nodded and waved to his fans before
entering the steel door. The room inside the steel door was bright. Monitors filled the desks. Wirling sounds rose from the computers. The machine
began to speak. 'Command Speak'.
Joey steared in amazment. It was miminicing his commands. 'open gimp', he spoke. 'Opening gimp', the machine replied.</p>
<p>ItWillBeMine steered at her computer her eyes flicking left to write. Reading the text on the screen. 'I"M GOING TO COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND MURDER
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY', the message wrote. 'Another death threat', she sighed to herself. She had been getting these increasingly since she became
a mod of RedditGetsDrawn.</p>
<p>She had a boring job. Sitting at a desk all day and ringing clients to try to sell them antivirus software. She knew herself that the software
was spyware. Clients installing the software on their machines meant that the company was able to use the machine to look at all their data.
It was closed source so no one was able to know what the software really did. It didn't protect people it harmed them.</p>
<p>She partically liked to ban developers that attempted to produce artwork. If she a office telemarketer wasnt able to draw she didnt want to
let developers draw.</p>
<p>ArtControl had started painting people on RedditGetsDrawn long before ItWillBeMine.</p>
<p>Why did ItWillBeMine take over the subreddit? What could be done instead. Allow all artists. There is no such thing as troll artwork.</p>
<p>ArtControl had been partically annoying for her. They had developed a script to create a new account for every piece of artwork they created
- submitted. They did alot of artwork - sometimes up to 30 pieces a day. That is up to 30 accounts her and other mods needed to find everyday
and ban. The script caused the artwork to be sent via message to the original poster, along a with mod mail. The art was uploaded to several
different places - but all redirect to artcontrol. This meant when they tried to ban a certain domain the artwork had been uploaded</p>
<p>ArtControl developed the machine to create and submit artwork to RedditGetsDrawn. They had grown tired of painting everyday but still wanted
to create art for the people of RedditGetsDrawn. The machine would look at all the reference images uploaded to GetDrawn via the api. It then
choice the best reference to draw. The machine painted the same way as ArtControl painted - it started the a white landscape document and
added a line layer, followed by grayscale and finally colour. The AI of the machine was able to match up the reference with the history of
ArtControls paintings, creating a unique pience of artwork in the same style as ArtControl.</p>
<p>It was a hot summer day on in Florida. St Andrews High School had just finished morning tea and the students were taking their streets.
Sirens approched the school. Swat team burst into classroom 14. 'Get on the ground', yelled an officer. The students and tutor scremed
and dropped to the ground. 'Which one is Vanessa May?', an officer asked the teacher. 9 officers cicled the students. They didn't seem
interested in the teacher. 'I am Vanessa', a quiet voice raised from the back. Offices moved to the back. Four officers stood over the
girl, who was trembling. 'Vanessa, you are under arrest', the lead officer said as another officer culfed the girl. 'Anything you say
may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attnery, if you cant afford one then one will be apointed for you,'
Do you understand', the lead officer told her. Vanessa nodded.</p>
<p>The officers escorted Vanessa out of the school building. The class stared at her as she exited the room.</p>
<p>'Class is dismissed', announced the computer. 'Be sure to have the reports ready for the next class on ArtControl: The Machine of Art'.
The robatic student stood up imediatly and walked out of the room in single file. 'Confiumed Master. Goodbye', the students spoke as they
exited the room.</p>
<p>Where you are going there are no roads.</p>
<p>ItWillBeMine was at home when she heard her private number ring. She had just banned 5 accounts of ArtControl. They had hired a programmer
to write a script that searched for art submissions that used ArtContols common colour. They wanted to match his style but it was becoming
difficut. She really wanted to find the machine that he was using to create these paintings. If she could get her hands on the machine
she will be able to stop him from posting once and for all.</p>
<p>He had been posting on RedditGetsDrawn for over 30 years. He was famous and loved on the subreddit except for her. She considered his
work troll art. Artcontrol had devoited his life to creating software and hardware to create artwork. They started small - creating
small scripts to building a fully automated machine that would mimic his painting style.</p>
<p>ItWillBeMine slowly climbed out of her seat. She had grown fat over the years from a poor diet and spending too much time sitting down.
She never walked, and rarely went outside. Her exhusband would pick her up for work daily. Her husband - Micheal grown tired of her
laziness and bad attatute and left her for another woman. He was much happier, but still saw her during the week when she picked
her up for work and dropped her off at home afterwards.</p>
<p>They split custoly of their daughter - she would 7 days at her monthers, followed by 7 days at her fathers. At the start of the sepration
Micheal got the majority of the time. She only spent every second weekend at her Mothers as the court decided she was unfit for a split
cusoley.</p>
<p>ItWillBeMine picked the phone up before the final ring. It had been setup to disconet the call if the phone was answered at the wrong
time. 'Hello', she spoke into the speaker. 'ItWillBeMine', a males voice replied. 'Yes, Who is this?', asked ItWillBeMine.
'This is dective Hans Lonery, I'm afaird to enforme you that we have your daughter. We need you to come down to the station'.</p>
<p>Art hold secret symbolism for a secret cult.</p>
<p>The artwork produced by the Machine was in being used to encrupt documents from the goverment. It allowed private keys to be created out
of artwork. The holder of public keys were able to recreate the artwork with their own ArtControl machine that was a copy of the original.
The hashes were matched to make sure none</p>
<p>Have something change, one mistake changes the future.</p>
<p>ArtControls light switched from red to green as it started to power up. It loaded the bios from the memory card. In its old system the bios
caused a mafanction which meant the kernal failed to load. The new bios had been original developed by Joey and Sarah. The system was open
source and has recieved contrubitions from thousands of people.
The system was originally developed to create artwork in the style of an artist. After the artist passed away they named the system after him.
The machine still creates artwork in the style of the artist but its system had been developed much further to do other tasks.
They were being created and trained in schools to in order to create a better future today.</p>
<p>Humans had started using ArtControl machines in space in order to explore areas that were too dangerous for humans. They were equipted with a
camera that took high res images - 160000 by 8000 pixels. The machines were able to paint scenes that could not be photographed.
NASA had order 1.3 million units that were to be sent to different areas.</p>

<p>Tonight i am testing my tablet with some writing. This tablet is old but seens to work ok.
One problem I have with it is that I have been unable to download.
I just ssaved it incase I lose my work. That is not going to happen is it?
This november there is going to be a worldwide writing challange - nanowrite. It involves writing 50,000 words in a month.
2014 was the first year that I attempted the challange. I managed 8,000 works or so.</p>
<p>Ideas for the book this year:</p>
<p>Autobio - write about my life so far.</p>
<p>RedditGetsDrawn - write about redditgets drawn. A day in the life of it will be mine.
ppo queem of peace always does it berrerc :-)</p>
<p>The Letter</p>
<p>Linus mouth dropped. The patch that he had applied had broken namespace.
He threw his monitor to the ground in anger and stormed out the room.
'Zombies steps', Linus spoke as he demostrated his walking desk. To his left was an old desk.
Harddrives and wires skattted the desk. 'That's my old desk' - he pointed towards the desk.
'The walking desk is better for my back'. He steared at a sleak 23 inch monitor as he moved his legs.
Typing he replied to an email.   Matthew has forked the kernal. To add BSD style securename.
Linus welcomed the idea. He only care about two things. Technology and the kernal.
Cheers erupted from the crowd. Fingers twitched as people updated their social media networks with the news.</p>
<p>The camera man switched the stream to a portrait of Linus. A smug grin covered his face. The claps from the crowd quietened.
The hashtag imwithlinus started on the networks. BroBeur had already picked up on the tag and switched
the script to start tweeting about it. It sent a tweet every 160 seconds of a subreddit that is
found by searching from a list of subreddits. A random subreddit is picked each time.
The operating system saves the subreddit post title as a filename plus html file.
Nikola  is used to build the site. The files are moved from the post folder into output. Files are uneffected.</p>
<p>The bluetooth device had used all its power up and he needed to switch to an onscreen</p>
