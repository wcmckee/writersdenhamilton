<p>How did the war between Magmah and Aquah begin?</p>
<p>Houses accused each other of stealing one others spell
Aquah unleashed an attack on Magmah. The two houses decided that the winner of
the war would decide the name of the other house and release all their spell
secrets. Of course like any war there was no winner and in the end on the break
of both houses collapsing the High Council of Ah decided that both houses lost
and renamed both houses. A peace treaty between the two houses was signed but
rivery was still tense between the houses.</p>
<p>The magical land of Hereva was born from the magical forces known as 'Chaos and
Evolutions'. Hereva formed when the magic elements of the cosmos evolved from the
chaos.</p>
<p>The trainer was waiting for Pepper at the magical underwater city.
She had planned the week out of spells that she would be teaching Pepper. The woman
tapped her feet as she waited for Pepper. She had no patience for lateness.</p>
<p>Coriander's fiftieth birthday was approaching and she had given a long list
of requests to her Father. She wanted to have the best birthday in Hereva and would
be highly disappointed if he didn't attend to all her requests. Her Father was meeting
with King Acren today. He had been pressuring the city of Komona to implement the tax
system.</p>
<p>Saffron steered out her bedroom window to the city of Kormana below. She lived high
above the city in a tall castle. Saffron liked to live up so high, it gave her power
above all those below her. The city itself was already floating Hereva. Her castle
was owned by the King, but one day when he died she would inherit all his worth. She
prayed that he wouldn't die anytime soon though, life was good with him around.
Only the rich and upper-class lived in Komona, the poor and peasants lived below on
Hereva.</p>
<p>Saffron sighed as she brushed her long blonde hair. Looking into the mirror her
large blue eyes stared back. She was perfect. Sitting on the dressing table
was her purple witches hat. She reached for it and place it upon her head. It matched
her suit. It was important she looked good. She wanted to be the best
witch so headed out the door to her classes. She knew the only way she was going to
be the best was attend classes. Saffron headed down the hallway, past the other
children rooms. They would still be sleeping, all orphans like herself but lazy
and unmotivated - unlike herself. Reaching the end of the hallway she headed down the
flight of steps. It wound around and around, past several stories of sleeping quarters.
Finally she reached the bottom where she was greeted by several orphanage working
preparing breakfast. She had no time for breakfast and waved them goodbye as she
unlocked the front door and headed out into the street. Saffron shrived in the brisk
cold morning. She wished she had another layer of clothes. Winter was approaching and
the tempture was changing. Saffron looked to her right. A group merchant were pushing
their cattle and cargo down the road towards the market. To Saffrons left was a bakery,
clothes store, potions shop, and the butcher. She headed towards the bakery. Outside
the bakery the smells were too good. The smell of fresh baking made Saffron regret
skipping out on breakfast. She skipped into the store. No one was behind the counter.
They must have been out the back. Saffron grabbed a cream bun and rushed back outside
before anyone spotted her. She walked down the road, eating the cream bun quite pleased
with herself. This was better than the breakfast her orphanage offered.
Now she needed to get to class.</p>

<p>Pepper continued with the recipe. Outside the lightning cracked and a rumble
of thunder could be heard. The dry ingredients were ground and added to a
boiling cauldron of wet ingredients - bats blood, lemon zest, vanilla essence,
and water. The brew bubbled as Pepper danced around the cauldron chanting:
'Witches Brew, Blind Bat, Sour Rabid,  Rise Cut, Cauldron Boil and cut this
grass'. Pepper repeated this chant three times before there was a loud band
and was blown back. 'Did I over do the ingredients', she thought - picking
herself up from the ground she approached the cauldron. The previous red mixture
had changed to a pale green colour. 'It worked!', Pepper yelled giving
Carrot a high five.</p>
<p>Now that the potion was complete Pepper needed a test subject. The recipe
recommended kidnapping an unsuspecting human but Pepper felt that was not
very nice. Instead she decided to test it on Carrot. Her cat could cut the
lawns if the potion worked. Pepper poured the thick green mixture into
Carrots water bowl. Carrot proceeded to lap the potion from it's bowl.
Peppere observed Carrot as the potions effects started to kick in. The cats
teeth grew and changed. They turned from short white like to a large metal like
and started to vibrate. The potion was working. Outside the lightning and thunder
had stopped and the weather had cleared up. The grass was dry and sun shining.
Pepper brought Carrot outside and watched as the cat began to cut the lawns.
It was working successfully. Pepper needed to cast a spell on Carrot in order
to stop from vomiting up the grass being ingested.</p>
<p>Cumin, Cayenne and Thyme could see their home in the distance as they flew
their brooms. The three were returning from a day trip to Qualicity.
"What is Pepper up to?", Cayenne asked as they approach the house. Cumin
squinted the Pepper and Carrot, the two up to something in the front of the
house.
"I'm not sure", Cumin replied, "but whatever it is I will find out". The
three witches landed at the house. Cayenne and Thyme went inside the house
carrying the shopping that they had got from Qualicity.
"You're home!', Pepper yelled excited to see Cumin standing over her.
"I guess you are wondering what we are up to?", Pepper added.
Cumin nodded, with a strange expression on her face. Pepper explained how she
created the potion and used it on Carrot and that Carrot was successfully
cutting the grass. Cumin was confused to why the grass needed cut. She had
lived in this house for years and had never cut it in the past. Pepper
explained about meeting the neighbour and wanting to do something to be more
normal.</p>
<p>Kielbasash vs Wharrgarblah</p>
<p>Magmah vs Aquah</p>
<p>The two schools are on the verge of war.</p>
<p>The house of Kielbasah is focused on cooking, baking, grilling, boiling, frying,
steaming and toasting. It is the house of alchemy and rare metals.</p>
<p>Wharrgarblah is the house of water, wind, clouds and the abyss. Those that are
members live deep under the ocean and rarely interact with those on land. They
believe they are super compared to those on the land.</p>
<p>Pepper swollen the underwater breathing potion and dived into the ocean. Carrot
followed closely behind. She had been receiving guest training from the house
of Wharrgarblah. The house was cauctionst at first with the training but soon
after discovering Peppers talents of water spells - they welcomed her.</p>
<p>Saffron floated on her broom with her cat Komona and watched Pepper dive into
the water. She had been following her for several weeks - with the suspension
that Pepper had became involved with the house Wharrgarblah or Aquah as Saffron
believed the house should be refereed as. Saffron despised the house. Because of
them she was an orphan. He parents were killed in the war between the two
houses. Saffron would do anything in her power to bring down the house and she
felt betrayed by Pepper for being involved with the house.</p>
<p>As Pepper swam she looked behind her and saw Carrot following close behind.
She had cast a spell on him that allowed him to enter the water without
getting wet - an air bubble. This allowed him to breath under water also.
This was just one of the spells Pepper had learnt from her new trainer at
the school of Wharrgarblah. She knew people would be suspicious of her
training with this school. She had learnt that her ancestors were part of the
house and that is why she was drawn into the house. Pepper wasn't worried. She
believed the houses should be kind and accepting to each other - sharing and
open.
Today Pepper was going to learn how to summon miniature bigfish. She had first
encountered BigFish when she was holidaying on an nearby island. Cumin had taught
her how to summon demons so she was able to pickup the spells for summoning
water spirits easily.</p>
<p>Saffron had attempted to follow Pepper further. She hoovered above the water.
She was too frightened to enter the water herself, there could be traps or she
might end up drowning. Instead she had cast a spell that allowed to her send
an eye into the ocean to follow Pepper. She was able to stay above the water,
but view what the eye was seeing. They eye was following closely behind Pepper
and Carrot. Saffron hoped that the eye wouldn't be noticed - for her sake and
Peppers.</p>
<p>Peppers broom had transformed and developed organic fins and propellers to
allow her to travel quickly under the water. She was able to zip along quickly,
with Carrot perched on the front of the broom.</p>

<p>PepperCarrot. A Novel by William Mckee</p>
<p>She sat at her workbench. Twirling the feather pen in her
hand. A Cat slept peacefully beside her.</p>
<p>The mailman approached the mailbox with caution. Warning:
Witch Property, the box read. He had been watching the
house since these new witches had moved in. Several nights
ago as he was chopping onions he noticed from his window
green smoke drifting out  from the property. He had concerns
for what mischief they were up to.
What was worse is it wasn't just a single witch that had
moved in - it was a group of them. Three adult witches and a
child. He had seen the lot of them leave the house on their
broomsticks. He had thought about approaching the house and
having a peak through the window but he was worried that there
might be traps - or that the witches return and cast a spell
on him.
The girl had been friendly. He had seen her walking down the
road with her ginger cat. He had been mowing his lawns (something
they needed to do) when she walked past his house giving
him a wave and yelling "Hello Neighbour, I'm Pepper".
Pepper had a basket containing mushrooms. She offered some
mushrooms to the man but he refused. She tried to talk to him
further but he rushed back inside like he was afraid of her.
The man stomped up his front door steps, opened the door and headed
inside.
The door slammed behind him.
Peaking out the window he watches as Pepper is steering at the
house. He closes the curt-ins and continues to peak out.
Pepper calls out to her cat which is distracted playing
with a moth, "Come on Carrot, Let's finish our walk".
The two continue to walk down the road.</p>
<p>The house might need some maintenance Pepper thought. She
the mailbox and looked out to her home in the distance.
The garden had grown wild. An ancient oak tree wrapped its
way through the house. Pepper had asked her godmothers
about clearing it. They were shocked and refused explaining
that the oak tree was in fact alive and they wouldn't dare
chop it.</p>
<p>Pepper had been given permission to mow the lawns. Maybe
if she maintained the house the neighbour wouldn't be
frightened of her anymore. She wasn't surprised when she
was told that they didn't own a lawnmower. 'Put your
training to use and use magic', Pepper was told. She spent
the morning looking through books for a spell that would
allow her to cut the grass. She found the perfect recipe.
The ingredients read: rose petals, cardamom, ginger, coriander,
hibiscus, red geranium, and powdered dragons tooth. All were
common herbs - except for the dragons tooth which was rare. Pepper
stepped out the back door and
headed towards the herb garden where the herbs grew. Reaching into
her pocket she pulled out a pair of secetares which she used to
cut the herbs. She hummed to herself as she works. The sky was turning
gray, a storm was coming. The Gods had predicted she was going to
make this spell. The first rain-dropped landed as Pepper finished
picking the herbs and took a step inside.
Pepper had picked the majority of ingredients she needed from the
garden. All she needed was the powdered dragons tooth. It was
in a glass container high in the shelf. Pepper climbed the ladder and
retrieved the glass container that contained the dragons tooth. She had
gone to a great deal to retrieve this - travelling around the world in
search of dragons and attempted to remove their teeth. In the end she
ended setting up a dragon dentist business and was overloaded with
toothache dragons that needed a tooth or two removed. Sadly she then
found out that the powdered dragons tooth didn't come from dragons but from
a plant. The Binomial name for Dragons Tooth was Lotus maritimus. It is part
of the genus Lotus. Pepper had to travel to South England for the plant. She
found it on a field in which cows were grazing. The plant had grown to a
height of 30cm.
The flowers were a pale yellow colour. The leaves in three's, 'clover'-like
but longer and terminating more suddenly at the far end.
Pepper learnt to make sure she knew what she was looking for before setting
out on future trips to retrieve ingredients.</p>
<p>Pepper had planted the dragons teeth that she had removed from the dragons
in order to build an skeleton army. She would order this army to help out with
her duty's around the house. Pepper watered the patch of garden where she had
planted the teeth twice a day but no skeleton had risen.</p>
