<p>Sarah could hear the jug had boiled. The bathroom door seprated her from the kitchen.
She had showered, rinsing the blood. The clothes that she wore had been given to her
by Antony. They had belonged to his ex-wife. Antony's wife had been in a terrible accident and passed away. Antony had never remarried but instead focused on
his work. Shortly after his wife's death he was hired to develop software to develop code for to get the computer to paint lines. Antony was
a specialist in writing code for graphics. Antony never meet the man who contracted him. All the code was uploaded to a server. He was given
a private key to connect to. When the code was uploaded to the server it is moved off the server and original content deleted.</p>
<p>Antony opened the pantry cabinet. He was hungry but wasn't quite sure what to make. Noodles seemed like a good choice.</p>
<p>Sarah opened the steel door and steeped into the room. Antony was standing in front of the cubard. He seemed to be deciding on something
to cook. 'Take a seat', he spoke. 'Thank you', Sarah replied, moving towards the table and chairs. 'You must be starving, is there anything
in particle you feel like?', asked Antony. 'Yes I am hungry, whatever is fine', Sarah replied. 'Fried noodles it is then', Antony reached
for the Japanese style noodles. 'Cut two onion', he spoke. A metal mechanical arm with a knife attached to the end on the bench started to
cut up two onions. 'auto fried noodles'. 'fried noodles started', replied the machine. Antony moved towards the table where Sarah was sitting.
'I will let the machine take care of dinner so we can talk', Antony remarked as he took a seat opposite Sarah. 'I will like you to explain
all events you can remember from the past twenty four hours', Antony asked Sarah. He took out a pad and pen.
'Where to begin', Sarah replied.</p>
<p>Sarah looked back at the Earth from the capsule. She was being sent to the moon on a mission to recover prototype 6b345 ArtControl. System
control had lost contact with it during a recent mission. It had been with 5 other prototype ArtControl machines exploring craters of the moon
before its radio-signal failed. It was suspected that its system had been taken over by a hacker and it was being remotely controlled by someone
on Earth. This was dangerous as this particle machine was designed with nuclear capabilities.
Sarah closes her eyes as she exited the Earth atmosphere. The ship she was traveling over was running the AI ArtControl system headless. This
allowed for ArtControl to control the ships functions so that the crew were able to relax. This cut down the risk of mistakes as ArtControl
was designed to not make a mistake.
Once on the moon Sarah would carry a Raspberry Pi computer hooked to her life support that would assist her on the mission to retrieve prototype
6b345. The Pi was running the AI Artcontrol.
Sarah stepped out of the pod. The her suit had been modified to allow her to walk on the moon with similar gravity to that of Earth.
20 meters in front of her she spotted the moon buggy. This was going to be used to get to the crater where system control last had contact
with 6b345. The buggy was equipped with GPS that would be controlled by ArtControl to take her to the crater.
She started moving towards the buggy. 'Sarah, this is system control', came a voice on her headset. 'confirm, This is Sarah', she replied.
'We notice you have arrived and exited the pod, status update' the voice asked. 'Everything is fine, moving toward the transport'.
'Roger that, ArtControl will take over once you reach the transport, system control out'. The transmission ended.
Sarah continued moving towards the transport. After finally reaching the transport she climbed into the seat. It was a single pod that had
been designed to move over the toughest conditions - perfect for the rocky texture of the moon.
Sarah reached for the Raspberry Pi from her belt and connected it to the transport.
The Pi switched on with the power given to it from the transport. The monitor in front of Sarah switched on. Bios loaded, and the kernel
booted. Once the operating system was loaded the transport began moving forward. Sarah strapped herself in as it began to speed up.</p>
<p>In a distance the prototype 6b345 ArtControl watched the transport zip across the moons surface. 6b345 stood still, knowing the humans
would not be able to find it.</p>
<p>3km till destination the monitor display. Estimated time of arrive: 45 seconds. Sarah could see the crater now that they gotten closer.
The transport started to slow down. It stopped just before reaching the crater. Destination reached the monitor displayed. Sarah unbuckled
her belt and climbed out of the transport. She moved into the crater. The place was a mess. Scraps of metal were lying around. She reached for
the camera in her belt and started to document the evidence. Something had happened her and it was her job to figure it out.
She moved deeper into the crater. What is this metal? She thought to herself, it was nothing like they had on Earth. It must of been some
sort of alien technology. Sarah bent over and gathered some of the metal depree into a evidence bag. Scientists back on Earth will analyze
this. It may shred some light on what happened to 6b345.</p>
<p>6b345 watched as the human gathered evidence from the site. It had activated its camo that rendered it invisible to the human eye.
It watched as the human placed an object into a bag. 'Sarah, this is system control', a voice blasted. 'We are getting some crazy
radio signals from your position, status update please'. The human lifted her arm towards her ear. 'Sarah', 6b345 thought to itself.
It loaded its database of human personal. 'Sarah Clarkson, 27 years old, American', The database showed. 'More detail', 6b345 loaded
more detailed information. 'Born New York December 15th 2021 at 5:32am to Danny and Mary Clarkson. Attended New York State School from
ages 5 till 17, studied computer science in New York University for 4 years. Currently working for NASA as a AI developer.'
6b345 shutdown the report.</p>
<p>A sharp bass notice blasted in Sarah ear. 'System Control, was that you', asked Sarah over her mic. 'Sarah, This is mission control.
We did not transmit, is there a problem?', replied system control. 'hmm strange, it was a bass sound happening in my headset', Sarah
remarked. "I'm done here, heading back to the pod". Sarah turned around and headed towards the transport. She needed to head back to
the pod and return to Earth with the evidence she had gathered. She reached the transport that would return her to the pod.
The process was the same as before - she took the Raspberry Pi from her belt and attached it to the transport. The monitor booted up
and transport turned around - heading towards the pods location.</p>
<p>6b345 held on to the transport as it started to move towards the pod. They were planning on traveling on the ship with Sarah. The camo
was running out of power though so it may need to hide in the pod during the return trip to Earth. This could cause issues if Sarah noticed
him on board. There was enough power to get on the pod and take off, which is the important.</p>
<p>Sarah pulled up at the pod. She dispatched the Raspberry Pi from the transport and unstopped herself. She was still getting a strange
bass sound from her headset. She moved towards the pod and took off.</p>
<p>As she was exiting the moon there was a large explosion. She looked down in horror to see that the moon had split, creating several
parts of the moon. The parts were attached only just, but this couldn't be good for Earth. The effects this would have on Earth would
be devastating. Maybe she wouldn't be able to return to Earth. Mars was an option - Humans had set up a base on the planet in case
something ever happened. It was mainly run by ArtControl machines but several hundred humans were preserved there as a backup for
humankind.</p>
<p>6b345 had curled into a small cube to fit inside the pod. They had made their way into the supply and inventory area where hopefully
they wouldn't be noticed. To preserve power they switched off the camo and would switch it on if someone entered the area or once
they landed back on earth.</p>

<p>"This is a great script editor! I am testing this. Hello from the otherside!".</p>
<p>ITWILLNOTBEMINE</p>
<p>By William Mckee.</p>
<p>This is a novel. First draft was created November 2015. First edit Feb 2016.</p>
<p>The clock struck midnight. The single light bulb in the room flickered. The temputre of the room was cool. The air condition kept it low.</p>
<p>Their hands hovered over the keyboard with a single finger clicking the keys.
Eyes moving back and forward on the screen. The monitor displayed an error dialog box. The private key was broken and had become corrupt. Unable to connect to the server.
Something had changed. A break was needed. Sometimes it was the best option.
They stood up suddenly, with arms reaching out and letting out a sigh. Their head looks around, then focused on the exit. The day had taken a toll on the body.</p>
<p>The jug on as they walked into the room. Tapped thier feet and reaching into their pocket to pull out a phone. A tap of the screen prompted for the password. It was running
a modified kernal version. Their fingers tapped the keys, inputing the code. Tapping the music icon. A list of stations began to scroll. "Oh the choices', they spoke, eyes fixed on the device
'Who are you talking too?', a voice spoke.</p>
<p>Sarah stood at the bottom of her works stairs. She looked up at the exit sign. Rain propaled from the sign. Her hand reached for the handle and bringing it down,
swinging the door open. Before taking a step outside she turned and yelled, 'Are you coming?'.</p>
<p>'One moment, cleaning up', a voice mutted from above. The man sat hunched over a keyboard and monitor. His fingers flicked quickly over
the keys. He was in a hurry and now had Sarah waiting for him. The monitor displayed a dialog box: status complete. A smile rose on his face. 'Joey has done it', he spoke.
Joey ripped out the USB from the hub and lepping up from the chair. He scrambled down the stairs towards Sarah 'Sorry about that,
he apoligised to Sarah. She was still holding the door open. 'Did it work?', she asked. Joey noded as they both stepped into the rain,
the door locking after them.</p>
<p>The sky turned black. Locking arms they walked the street together. The street was deserted. Abanand cars, fallen light poles, the orcasinal dead body.
Sirens scretched in the distance. 'Do you think they are coming for us?' asked Joey. "There are bigger problems for them to
deal with. They are certainly not', Sarah replied. 'careful, watch your step', she added. A toppled burning building lay in their path. They carefully manovered
the rubble. 'Not much further', Joey spoke. 'It's just around this corner'. The path twisted and the two turned into a narrow alleyway. They walked
past several abanded building before reaching a great big red door which read: Number 6 TechFuncMasters.</p>
<p>'This is it', Sarah wispered. She raised her hand and gave two solid knocked on the door. Movement could be heard inside, the sound growing louder.
'Who goes there?', the voice inside spoke. 'Sarah and Joey', spoke sarah. The door crecked open. A man in his mid 40 stood.in front of them. He was
tall - 6 foot 5 with a long brown beard and blue eyes. His head was saved. He wore circal glasses. ' i am Uganka ', he spoke in a eastern european
accent. He held his hand out and shook both Joeys, followed by Sarahs hands. 'it is nice to meet you finally ', Joey said as he shook Uganka's
hand with a strong grip. 'Please come in out of this rain', Uganka greeted them into the building. The two stepped into the door. 'Please follow me',
Uganka spoke as he started to was down the hall way. Saray and Joey followed the man, arms still linked together.</p>
<p>They reached the end of the hall and stopped at a steel door. Uganka stopped. ' Is something wrong? ', Sarah asked. 'This is your last chance to leave',
spoke. Uganka. 'ther is no turning back from here'. 'no we wnt to do this', both Joey and Sarah spoke. 'very well', uganka spoke as he unlocked the
steel door. They walked into a room that was pitch black. Sarah grabbed Joeys arm in fear. Ã­ts ok, joey wispered.  The steel door behind them slammed
shut and they both jumped. Purple and red lazers starting wizzing around. 'Where is Uganka', asked Joey. The man that had lead them into the room
was gone. A wizzing noice started. Growing louder, andd louder. Sarah and Joey let go of each other and held their hands to their ears. Along with
the wizzing sound increasing a new sound began - sirens. The two dropped to the ground. Sarah was the first to screem and started moving in a
circle motionon the ground. Joey started screaming shortly afterwards.  The sound was deafening. Suddently the room flashed with lightning as the noise
stoppeed. The room returned to norma lighting, but the room was empty. Both Sarah and Joey had vanished.</p>
<p>The single light bulb in the room flickered. Antoney lay back on his chair. His left monitor had the latest episode of a telvison show. The central monitor had a web browser
open with a IPython Notebook running. The right monitor had test results being displayed. Three terminal windows,
all displayed results of his code changes. Smaller security camera displays hovered above the monitors. These cameras were spread throughout the rooms in the building
and surrounding areas. The feed was tapped into the cities traffic cameras and a realtime feed of the surounding streets. A quick exit would be posible in case of any trouble.</p>
<p>'Alert - inruder in section 31', the monitor displayed a large flashing dialog box on his currently viewing screen. The eye inplunts allowed the system to track movement and focus, making smart interface decisions.
Glancing up from the television show to the cctv monitors. 'switch to room 18', he spoke.
Thee monitor zoomed in on a camera in room 18. 'That's strange', antoney pondered. The room looked normal. 'Maybe I need to check it out
myself', he rose from his chair and started walking towards the steel door. He unlocked it and walked through. The room was pitch black. 'Somethings
wrong', he spoke. 'This can't be happening'. The lights switched on and everything seemed normal.</p>
<p>Antoney caucioly walked through the room heading toward room 18. He peaked around the hallway corner. Empty. He started walking down the hallway.
A womans screem and frooze. 'Who's there', he yelled. Now he knew there was an inruder. He reached for his handgun.
He was ready. 'I have a gun', he warned. walking towards the screams. He reached the door. The
letters 18 read on it. "I'm going to enter", he warned. Gun drawn he busted through the door.</p>
<p>The woman lay in the center of the floor. She was shivering, naked and covered in blood.
"Who are you?", Antony crepts towards the woman. How did you get in here?" He
lowered his weapon. She was no harm. Her screams had stopped.
"Sarah", she told him. She leapt from the ground. and wrapped her body around Antony. He was startled at the movement. a little shocked to have this woman suddenly
over him. In his arms she sobd. 'now,  now, he spoke, pating him on the back. he gently pushed her off him, moving her to an office seat.
'lets find you a blanket', he said. He spots a rugs that he wraps around you.
'How did you get here', Antony asks Sarah. Still shacking she repied with, 'The last thing I remember is purple and red lights'.
'hmm, interesting', spoke Antony. 'What is todays date?', asks Antony. 'The date..', Sarah pauses. 'It is November 21st 2065'.
Antonys draw drops. 'You believe the year is 2065?'. Sarah gives him a confused look. 'Sarah, it's the year 3532'.</p>
<p>Antony switched on the jug and began making a coffee. As he poured the water a voice apeared from behind him.</p>
<p>The keys S.T.A.R.T.S.Y.S.T.E.M. was typed onto the machine. Return. The main led light switched to green. A wirling sound began as the machine
started up. He fixed his glasses as he nervously waited for the boot. Tests had passed, but now it was the real deal. The bios
had finished loading and the machine was booting the kernal. The most progress the machine had ever done. Scientists and developers
had worked for 30 years to develop this machine. The room was airgapped and blocked all signals. This was to stop interference from
any 3rd party. Attempts had been made to modify the machine. The machine was on the 10th floor of the building.
inside another building. Large fenced surrounded each of the builds with turrets to shoot anything that moved.
It was not posible for anyone to reach the machine. Even the machine being controling wasn't the real. It was sending signals to the real machine.
If the fake machine was comporomised then the true machine would still be safe. The system had successfully booted. The text 6b345 was displayed on
screen. He squinted at the text, knowing it was would be special.</p>
<p>The handed on the clock ticked over to three thiry two. LED lights on the panel displayed the year November 21st 2065. Twenty percent of the time
the machine got the time collabration correct but from time to time an error accured.</p>
<p>He stood in front of the crowd. A grin on his face and a laptop under his arm. The television show had just won awards for the best
Drama and an award for best actor. He didn't feel much like an actor. He waved as the crowd cheered. Cameras flashed as he bowed.
One of his security whispered into his ear, 'Sir, we need to move'. He nodded and waved to the crowd before exiting the stage.
He marched towards the steel door with security following behind.</p>
<p>The room inside the steel door was bright. Monitors filled the desks. Wirling sounds rose from the computers. The machine
began to speak. 'Command Speak'.
Joey steared in amazment. It was miminicing his commands. 'open gimp', he spoke. 'Opening gimp', the machine replied.</p>
<p>She steered at her computer her eyes flicking around the display.  The text, "I'M GOING TO COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND MURDER
YOUR FAMILY', apeared on . 'Another death threat', she sighed to herself. This was forwarded onto the cyber crime devision to investage.
She had been getting these increasingly since she became a moduratier.</p>
<p>The job was boring. She sat at a desk and contacted clients, attempting to sell antivirus software. The software
was spyware. Clients that installed the software had data stolen. The software was closed and It was closed source so no one was able to know what the</p>
<p>She partically liked to ban developers that attempted to produce artwork. If she a office telemarketer wasnt able to draw she didnt want to
let developers draw.</p>
<p>ArtControl had started painting people on RedditGetsDrawn before she was even born. Why did ItWillBeMine take over the subreddit?
What could be done instead. Allow all artists. There is no such thing as troll artwork.</p>
<p>ArtControl had been partically annoying for her. They had developed a script to create a new account for every piece of artwork they created
- submitted. They did alot of artwork - sometimes up to 30 pieces a day. That is up to 30 accounts her and other mods needed to find everyday
and ban. The script caused the artwork to be sent via message to the original poster, along a with mod mail. The art was uploaded to several
different places - but all redirect to artcontrol. This meant when they tried to ban a certain domain the artwork had been uploaded</p>
<p>ArtControl developed the machine to create and submit artwork to RedditGetsDrawn. They had grown tired of painting everyday but still wanted
to create art for the people of RedditGetsDrawn. The machine would look at all the reference images uploaded to GetDrawn via the api. It then
choice the best reference to draw. The machine painted the same way as ArtControl painted - it started the a white landscape document and
added a line layer, followed by grayscale and finally colour. The AI of the machine was able to match up the reference with the history of
ArtControls paintings, creating a unique pience of artwork in the same style as ArtControl.</p>
<p>It was a hot summer day on in Florida. St Andrews High School had just finished morning tea and the students were taking their streets.
Sirens approched the school. Swat team burst into classroom 14. 'Get on the ground', yelled an officer. The students and tutor scremed
and dropped to the ground. 'Which one is Vanessa May?', an officer asked the teacher. 9 officers cicled the students. They didn't seem
interested in the teacher. 'I am Vanessa', a quiet voice raised from the back. Offices moved to the back. Four officers stood over the
girl, who was trembling. 'Vanessa, you are under arrest', the lead officer said as another officer culfed the girl. 'Anything you say
may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attnery, if you cant afford one then one will be apointed for you,'
Do you understand', the lead officer told her. Vanessa nodded.</p>
<p>The officers escorted Vanessa out of the school building. The class stared at her as she exited the room.</p>
<p>'Class is dismissed', announced the computer. 'Be sure to have the reports ready for the next class on ArtControl: The Machine of Art'.
The robatic student stood up imediatly and walked out of the room in single file. 'Confiumed Master. Goodbye', the students spoke as they
exited the room.</p>
<p>Where you are going there are no roads.</p>
<p>She was at home when the private number ring. She had just banned five troll accounts. They had hired a programmer
to write a script that searched for art submissions that used common colours of the troll. They wanted to match its style but it was becoming
difficut. She needed to find the machine that was used to create the paintings. If she could get the machine, she would stop the posts.</p>
<p>Trolls had been posting artwork on RedditGetsDrawn for over 30 years. Some were famous and loved. She considered his
work troll art. It had devoited their life to creating software and hardware for the progression of art. It started small, creating
small scripts,  to building a fully automated machines (that would mimic painting styles).</p>
<p>Slowly climbing out of her seat she moved towards the ringing. Over the years she had grown fat. A combonation of poor diet and laziness. and spending too much time sitting down.
She never walked, and rarely went outside. Her exhusband would pick her up for work daily.</p>
<p>Her husband - Micheal grown tired of her
laziness and bad attatute and left her for another woman. He was much happier, but still saw her during the week when she picked
her up for work and dropped her off at home afterwards.</p>
<p>They split custoly of their daughter - she would 7 days at her monthers, followed by 7 days at her fathers. At the start of the sepration
Micheal got the majority of the time. She only spent every second weekend at her Mothers as the court decided she was unfit for a split
cusoley.</p>
<p>ItWillBeMine picked the phone up before the final ring. It had been setup to disconet the call if the phone was answered at the wrong
time. 'Hello', she spoke into the speaker. 'ItWillBeMine', a males voice replied. 'Yes, Who is this?', asked ItWillBeMine.
'This is dective Hans Lonery, I'm afaird to enforme you that we have your daughter. We need you to come down to the station'.</p>
<p>Art hold secret symbolism for a secret cult.</p>
<p>The artwork produced by the Machine was in being used to encrupt documents from the goverment. It allowed private keys to be created out
of artwork. The holder of public keys were able to recreate the artwork with their own ArtControl machine that was a copy of the original.
The hashes were matched to make sure none</p>
<p>Have something change, one mistake changes the future.</p>
<p>ArtControls light switched from red to green as it started to power up. It loaded the bios from the memory card. In its old system the bios
caused a mafanction which meant the kernal failed to load. The new bios had been original developed by Joey and Sarah. The system was open
source and has recieved contrubitions from thousands of people.
The system was originally developed to create artwork in the style of an artist. After the artist passed away they named the system after him.
The machine still creates artwork in the style of the artist but its system had been developed much further to do other tasks.
They were being created and trained in schools to in order to create a better future today.</p>
<p>Humans had started using ArtControl machines in space in order to explore areas that were too dangerous for humans. They were equipted with a
camera that took high res images - 160000 by 8000 pixels. The machines were able to paint scenes that could not be photographed.
NASA had order 1.3 million units that were to be sent to different areas.</p>

<p>one of the oldest tricks in the book too place. Death had slowed the Witch
down but she was still making a grab for her wand. He thought she had lost.
But for the second time that day Death was wrong. The Witch was able to reach
for her wand and yell off several words that Death didn't understand.
This caused him to be become stunned. The slowing spell Death had cast on the
witch was reserved.</p>
<p>The eye continued to follow Pepper under the ocean. The young witch had summoned
three of her demons that she commanded to attach the practice dummy.
Her Demons had morphed since Pepper had learnt these new sets of summon
spells. No longer were they land based Demons who liked cupcakes and drinking
tea, they were water and wind warrior elements.
The three Demons themselves were proud of their new powers. They were better
equipped to defend Pepper - like they had defended her parents and
grandparents before. In the end they had failed their masters - both
Peppers grandparents and parents were killed under their protection. The three
Demons swore that the devastation would never happen again and have focused
on protecting Pepper.</p>
<p>The neighbour peeked out his lounge windows at the Witches house.
A tall dark figure swept across the Witches property. Beside the figure
was a small Witch. She had a concerned expression. The neighbour knew something
was wrong. The older Witches were not home. He had seen the Three leave the
house on their brooms in the early morning.
He had to do something. Contact somebody. Stop this figure.
His best hope was to take his flying car and find the Witches. They would
go gone to the markets in Korama.
Using the old rusted blue car he was able to travel to the City to warn the
Three Witches.</p>
<p>The Witches had just finished their  shopping and  flying past the branches
of The Great Tree. In the distance  ahead of them a madman  was driving a
blue flying car towards then. The Witches  dashed out the way as the car
came near, slamming on the breaks. The vehicle slowed down, the man inside
yelling and waving, one arm clutching the steering wheel.The Witches look
around in wonder. The driver was clearly trying to communicate with them.
A man opened the door of the halted vechile, it was floating there with three Witches
at a cautions distance observing. He yelled about something happened at their
home and they needed to return. Created a summoning portal that teleported the
three witches to their home. They rushed inside the building to find Pepper.
They found the girl at her desk drawing up plans for her next spell. Nothing
was wrong. Beside her slept Carrot, the ginger coloured Cat.
A large smile appeared on Peppers face as she noticed her three godmothers
in the room. The shortest and oldest on the left. The leader of the group.
A skinny, tall, young spell tutor and an older plump rounded potions master.
The three had been training  the Pepper everything they knew about being a
Witch. Pepper was to become a true witch of chaos.  The three had promised
the girls parents and grandparents that they would train the girl.
The majority of children Peppers age became orphans due to the war between
two of the magic houses. Other houses were caught in the middle of the
convicts. Lands were destroyed and inhabits slaughtered.</p>
<p>Peppers new demons took on new forms. Instead of the texture of slime on their
bodies they had a water and transparent wind type forms. They were able to
switch back to their previous forms. One Demon was pure water based. Another
was pure wind based. The final was a mixture of the water and wind.
The water based demon was shaped like a mixture of dolphin and octopus.
Shaped like a dolphin for quick and efficient movement in the water. Long
octopus-like arms and legs coming off the body. When the demon was  on land
it used these octopus legs  to walk, it was certainly not faster than
travelling under the water, but it was OK.
The other side of the schools spells - wind. This demon was filled with fast
moving modules that caused the appearance of things to be blurred and mixed
up. Transparent at essence.
The final demon was a hybrid of the wind and water spells. The appearance was
a blurred effect with water being crashed around the figure. Waves hitting
the shoreline. Lightning cracks. Thunder booms.
Pepper had successfully summoned the three demons in their water and
wind forms. Her previous attempts were failures and the demons were twisted,
deformed, and powerless. She was excited for herself that this was a success.
She knew her parents would be proud of her. If they were still alive. She
had joined this house of magic as she wanted to take revenge for her
parents and houses peoples deaths.
Saffron was her largest threat. Pepper had recently discovered she was following
Pepper. The girl won't be able to follow her to the underwater city but she
was able to summon a eye that followed Pepper and  Carrot under the water
and  to the city. Pepper couldn't allow Saffron to discover where the city
was as she would unleash her army onto the city. Pepper instead  cast a spell
of her own that replaced the footage that the eye recorded with fake images,
leading the army into a trap and death.
He had told Pepper that judgement day was coming and she needed to train for it,
War was  near between some of the worlds most powerful Witches and creatures.
The water elements attacked the cities walls coming in  from the  north east
side  off the ocean. The city had attempted to setup boulders to stop  the
water and break  up  the flow. The  wind elements swept in and lifted these
obscures. The path was  clear for the water to crash upon the cities walls.
After the wind  elements had  cleared a path, the focused on attacking the
city walls in an attempt to collapse. The walls were tough and they stood
strong. The water elements changed tactics and the sky started to pour
with rain and hail above the city. Wind elements stopped attacking the city
walls and  started to lift up the ground - causing mud to spread over the city.
The mixture of mud and rain  caused people to move slow and become inaccurate
with their weapons.
The elements still needed to breach the city. Their defences were low. The
Water elements searched the city for an weak spots. They discovered a door
which had started to leak under the pressure of water and rain. The elements
were able to focus the door - causing a series of tidal waves to hit the door.
Wind elements assisted the water in creation of the tidal waves.
The door burst down after the third tidal wave hit it. Water smashed it's way over the guard building and towards the market square. The elements had
gained entry to the city.
The towns people were helpless when the waves came. They were knee deep in mud and unable to move.
The rain had stopped now that water was focused on tidal waves throughout the
city. A bright sun shone down - causing the mud to harden - trapping the
guards on the spot. They were able to fight the elements but were unable to
move and dodge the attacks. The elements were winning.
Under the ocean in the city an army of Witches controlled these elements -
commanding them to attack the city. They were after one thing - the seed of
flight. It is told that these seeds will grow a magical tree that has the
power of growth and flight - and spreads it to others. The Aquaq Witches wanted
the seed for themselves. Amongst the army of Witches was Peppers parents and
grandparents. Six witches. All commanding the attack on the city of Komora.
The city was in a panic.</p>

<p>Pepper sat on her bed and steered out the window. Her hands on knees.
Carrot looked up. She knows Pepper is upset about her birthday.
Carrot jumps up  on the bed and trys to comfite Pepper.
"It's nearly my birthday and I don't have any friends to celebrate
it with..", Pepper cries. Her head lowers and she bursts into tears.
Hands cover her face. Carrot strokes Peppers shoulder, it does no use.
An idea springs into Carrots head. She springs across to the table.
Carrots claw points at a framed photograph.
"Oh, invite the other witches we met at the Poition Contest?", Pepper
congrats Carrot. A smile apeared on Peppers face. Carrot is pleased with herself.
Pepper and Carrot work together and write invitations with Peppers feather pen.
The two remember back to the day of the potion contest.</p>
<p>"As Mayor of Komona I declear the potion content... Open!",
The mans arms stretched out in excitment. In his right hand he grasped a rolled
scroll. The bag of gold behind him sparked in the sunlight. The four Witchs glearing
at the prize and each other. The winner would get a large prize.
"Our town is delighted to welcome no fewer than four witches for this first
edition", the major continued. He turned and faced the four witches,
"Please give a HUGE round of applause". The crowd burst with noise. A mixture of
nonmagical and magical beings were present in the crowd. Every house of magic was
present. This was one of the key events that lead to Hereva to be destoried. Death
had succecced finally. Pepper faced Death several times. She set traps for him and
hunted him down. For once it wasn't Death that did the hunting. Pepper could feel
icey breath on the back of his shoulder. She knew he was present. Twisting her head
she looked back. Nothing. The bottom of The Great Tree was visible. It's bark
obsorbing the healthy rays of the sun. Tinkle of silver made Pepper focus again.
Coriander was introduced first by the speaker, "All the way from the great
Technologist's Union, it's an honor to welcome the ravishing and ingenious
CORIANDER!". Posing with her chicken in her right arm and holding an orange
potion with her left arm.
Pepper had traveled back to that moment several times in an attempt to change
the future. It was no use, each time she changed events it got worse.</p>
<p>The speaker continues to introduce the witches,
"not to forget our local girl, Komona's very own witch SAFFRON!". Tilting her head to the
right Saffron smiled holding her right hand on her hip and in the left arm holding the
potion, filled with a yellow bubbly liquid.</p>
<p>"... Our third participant come to us from the lands of setting moons, SHICHIMI!",
The foxs tail was wrapped around the back of Shichimis neck and the fox perched on
the witches left arm. In her other hand she grasped a potion that was green and
had no bubble.
".. and finally, our last participant from the forest of Squirels End, Pepper!",
Standing with a sour and disapointed look on her face. Carrot held up Peppers
potions. It was a pale yellow colour. Death approved of the colour but would rather
a pale green.</p>
<p>The problem with time travel is it's easy to get lost and create too many
characters.</p>
<p>The Demons of Chaosah Hornük, Eyeük and Spidük had morphed into their
Wharrgarblah alternative they were much the same - except water and
wind based. Hornük's green fur had grown in length. For the past week
they had been summoned daily into Hereva. The Four Horse Man had been
unleased on the world and the Demons had been summoned to stop them.
Famine had caused the crops in Hereva to die - starting with Squirrel's
End. The 2,000 villagers that lived there - the majority of them Farmers
and poor lost everything. War causd a war between
magic houses. Citizens of Hereva became ill because of the rider
Pestilence. Disease spread. Death was present at Komona when the package
was being transfered. "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"</p>
<p>A package was being transfered from Squirrel's
end to Komona. The contents would stop the war. Both  Magmah and Aquah
wanted to get their hands on it. The interception happened when the
package was traveling through the park in centre Komona. Aquah forces had
breached the city. The majority of the attack came from the skys.
Saffron's grandparents forght for Magmah and Peppers for Aquah.
The cities walls were destoried by the attack. A large Aquah army
moved through the crumbling walls. The Magmah army retreaded.
The magic school of Ah had discovered the seeds. An eldely witch
that lived in Squirrels Edge had created them. When Magmah and
Aquah had discovered the two armies launched attacks on the farmland
in search for the package. It only contained three seeds. When the Ah
transporer was intercepted in Komona one of the seeds was dropping -
causing The Great Tree to grow - lifting the city of Komona into the
sky. The polin of the tree spread to other areas of Hereva. In Squirrels
Edge the creatures are morphed and plants trees grow with magical powers.
The quality of the food improves dramatically. The crops grow easily.
The Great Tree stops the war. The armies lay down their arms go home.
The House of Ah force Magmah and Aquah to change their names to Kielbasah
and Wharrgarblah.</p>
<p>Only four dudes so hardcore they can wipe out all sentient life on Hereva.
Portal opened to Hereva and they entered and attempted to wipe out a fourth of the
world each.</p>
<p>The Burger King crown sat upon the statues head. His mouth opening revealing a
nice set of white teeth. The brown beard was well groomed and his hair
curled. "Where is your God now"?, the Statue spoke.</p>
<p>War had been around for centuies and despite Henevas best effects, some of them are
still alive. In his right arm he welded a white staff. It was bluetooth connected.
At the top of the staff was a monitor display. Feeds were sent over and procied
by War. Approval or Denial was given. His job was mostly automated now. After he
was defeated by The Great Tree he lived a relaxed life. Staying in the city of
Komona he stayed hidden by hiding in plain daylight.</p>
<p>"Mama were all going to die"</p>
<p>"WHO ELSE WERE YOU EXPECTING?", Death whispered into the slowed Witches ear.
Her fingers almost touched her wand. Bursting into laughter Death clapped his
hands.</p>
<p>"Let the games begin!", a voice boomed over the statium. "The vote will be by
applaud-o-meter". First up Coriander's demostration. The dark skinned Witch stood
forward. Holding in left right hand was a dead bird. It's feathers pale. The Bird
had meet with Death already. "Ladies and Gentlemen", Coriander greeted the crowd.
"Fear death no more, thanks to my...", she poured the liquid from her potion onto
the dead animal. "Potion of ZOMBIFICATION!", she yelled towards the crowd. The crowd
clapped as the dead animal rose from the dead and marched forward. Death had failed and
felt very disapointed. Among the crowd Death steered at the girl and the
bright smile on her face, so pleased with herself that she was able to cheat him.
"FANTASTIC! Coriander defies death itself with this mi-ra-cu-lous potion!"
Because they were mocking him Death felt more angry.
Coriander bowed and the applause grew louder. Saffron intrupted the moment,
"But please.. save your applause, people of Komana". The crowd was silent.
"beacause here is MY potion", Saffron announced holding her poition obove her
head. "The real potion you've all been waiting for: the one which will amaze
your neighbors...", the young witch had captavated the crowd. "...make them
jealous!", Saffrpn poured her potion onto the zombie bird. "... all this is possible
with the simple application of a single drop of my ...", a drip of the potion
touched the feathers of the bird.
"POTION OF POSHNESS", Saffron screamed. The bird grew in size. It gained a curly
hairdo and dark gray coloured sunglasses. A brown pokerdot handbag apeared
under it's right wing.  The crowd burst into applause.</p>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: ERROR/3 (<tt class="docutils">&lt;string&gt;</tt>, line 128)</p>
Unexpected indentation.</div>
<blockquote>
"Fantastic! Incredible! This potion could make all of Komana rich!". Saffron steered
at Coriander with a smerk on her face. Coriander looked back and frowned.
"Your applause can't be wrong. Coriander has already been eliminated", a smile
flashed accross Saffrons face. Deeper into the abyss Coriander fell. She had been
defeated. The voice moved on to the third witch, "That last demostration would now
seem difficult to beat for Shichimi".</blockquote>

<p>How did the war between Magmah and Aquah begin?</p>
<p>Houses accused each other of stealing one others spell
Aquah unleashed an attack on Magmah. The two houses decided that the winner of
the war would decide the name of the other house and release all their spell
secrets. Of course like any war there was no winner and in the end on the break
of both houses collapsing the High Council of Ah decided that both houses lost
and renamed both houses. A peace treaty between the two houses was signed but
rivery was still tense between the houses.</p>
<p>The magical land of Hereva was born from the magical forces known as 'Chaos and
Evolutions'. Hereva formed when the magic elements of the cosmos evolved from the
chaos.</p>
<p>The trainer was waiting for Pepper at the magical underwater city.
She had planned the week out of spells that she would be teaching Pepper. The woman
tapped her feet as she waited for Pepper. She had no patience for lateness.</p>
<p>Coriander's fiftieth birthday was approaching and she had given a long list
of requests to her Father. She wanted to have the best birthday in Hereva and would
be highly disappointed if he didn't attend to all her requests. Her Father was meeting
with King Acren today. He had been pressuring the city of Komona to implement the tax
system.</p>
<p>Saffron steered out her bedroom window to the city of Kormana below. She lived high
above the city in a tall castle. Saffron liked to live up so high, it gave her power
above all those below her. The city itself was already floating Hereva. Her castle
was owned by the King, but one day when he died she would inherit all his worth. She
prayed that he wouldn't die anytime soon though, life was good with him around.
Only the rich and upper-class lived in Komona, the poor and peasants lived below on
Hereva.</p>
<p>Saffron sighed as she brushed her long blonde hair. Looking into the mirror her
large blue eyes stared back. She was perfect. Sitting on the dressing table
was her purple witches hat. She reached for it and place it upon her head. It matched
her suit. It was important she looked good. She wanted to be the best
witch so headed out the door to her classes. She knew the only way she was going to
be the best was attend classes. Saffron headed down the hallway, past the other
children rooms. They would still be sleeping, all orphans like herself but lazy
and unmotivated - unlike herself. Reaching the end of the hallway she headed down the
flight of steps. It wound around and around, past several stories of sleeping quarters.
Finally she reached the bottom where she was greeted by several orphanage working
preparing breakfast. She had no time for breakfast and waved them goodbye as she
unlocked the front door and headed out into the street. Saffron shrived in the brisk
cold morning. She wished she had another layer of clothes. Winter was approaching and
the tempture was changing. Saffron looked to her right. A group merchant were pushing
their cattle and cargo down the road towards the market. To Saffrons left was a bakery,
clothes store, potions shop, and the butcher. She headed towards the bakery. Outside
the bakery the smells were too good. The smell of fresh baking made Saffron regret
skipping out on breakfast. She skipped into the store. No one was behind the counter.
They must have been out the back. Saffron grabbed a cream bun and rushed back outside
before anyone spotted her. She walked down the road, eating the cream bun quite pleased
with herself. This was better than the breakfast her orphanage offered.
Now she needed to get to class.</p>

<p>Pepper continued with the recipe. Outside the lightning cracked and a rumble
of thunder could be heard. The dry ingredients were ground and added to a
boiling cauldron of wet ingredients - bats blood, lemon zest, vanilla essence,
and water. The brew bubbled as Pepper danced around the cauldron chanting:
'Witches Brew, Blind Bat, Sour Rabid,  Rise Cut, Cauldron Boil and cut this
grass'. Pepper repeated this chant three times before there was a loud band
and was blown back. 'Did I over do the ingredients', she thought - picking
herself up from the ground she approached the cauldron. The previous red mixture
had changed to a pale green colour. 'It worked!', Pepper yelled giving
Carrot a high five.</p>
<p>Now that the potion was complete Pepper needed a test subject. The recipe
recommended kidnapping an unsuspecting human but Pepper felt that was not
very nice. Instead she decided to test it on Carrot. Her cat could cut the
lawns if the potion worked. Pepper poured the thick green mixture into
Carrots water bowl. Carrot proceeded to lap the potion from it's bowl.
Peppere observed Carrot as the potions effects started to kick in. The cats
teeth grew and changed. They turned from short white like to a large metal like
and started to vibrate. The potion was working. Outside the lightning and thunder
had stopped and the weather had cleared up. The grass was dry and sun shining.
Pepper brought Carrot outside and watched as the cat began to cut the lawns.
It was working successfully. Pepper needed to cast a spell on Carrot in order
to stop from vomiting up the grass being ingested.</p>
<p>Cumin, Cayenne and Thyme could see their home in the distance as they flew
their brooms. The three were returning from a day trip to Qualicity.
"What is Pepper up to?", Cayenne asked as they approach the house. Cumin
squinted the Pepper and Carrot, the two up to something in the front of the
house.
"I'm not sure", Cumin replied, "but whatever it is I will find out". The
three witches landed at the house. Cayenne and Thyme went inside the house
carrying the shopping that they had got from Qualicity.
"You're home!', Pepper yelled excited to see Cumin standing over her.
"I guess you are wondering what we are up to?", Pepper added.
Cumin nodded, with a strange expression on her face. Pepper explained how she
created the potion and used it on Carrot and that Carrot was successfully
cutting the grass. Cumin was confused to why the grass needed cut. She had
lived in this house for years and had never cut it in the past. Pepper
explained about meeting the neighbour and wanting to do something to be more
normal.</p>
<p>Kielbasash vs Wharrgarblah</p>
<p>Magmah vs Aquah</p>
<p>The two schools are on the verge of war.</p>
<p>The house of Kielbasah is focused on cooking, baking, grilling, boiling, frying,
steaming and toasting. It is the house of alchemy and rare metals.</p>
<p>Wharrgarblah is the house of water, wind, clouds and the abyss. Those that are
members live deep under the ocean and rarely interact with those on land. They
believe they are super compared to those on the land.</p>
<p>Pepper swollen the underwater breathing potion and dived into the ocean. Carrot
followed closely behind. She had been receiving guest training from the house
of Wharrgarblah. The house was cauctionst at first with the training but soon
after discovering Peppers talents of water spells - they welcomed her.</p>
<p>Saffron floated on her broom with her cat Komona and watched Pepper dive into
the water. She had been following her for several weeks - with the suspension
that Pepper had became involved with the house Wharrgarblah or Aquah as Saffron
believed the house should be refereed as. Saffron despised the house. Because of
them she was an orphan. He parents were killed in the war between the two
houses. Saffron would do anything in her power to bring down the house and she
felt betrayed by Pepper for being involved with the house.</p>
<p>As Pepper swam she looked behind her and saw Carrot following close behind.
She had cast a spell on him that allowed him to enter the water without
getting wet - an air bubble. This allowed him to breath under water also.
This was just one of the spells Pepper had learnt from her new trainer at
the school of Wharrgarblah. She knew people would be suspicious of her
training with this school. She had learnt that her ancestors were part of the
house and that is why she was drawn into the house. Pepper wasn't worried. She
believed the houses should be kind and accepting to each other - sharing and
open.
Today Pepper was going to learn how to summon miniature bigfish. She had first
encountered BigFish when she was holidaying on an nearby island. Cumin had taught
her how to summon demons so she was able to pickup the spells for summoning
water spirits easily.</p>
<p>Saffron had attempted to follow Pepper further. She hoovered above the water.
She was too frightened to enter the water herself, there could be traps or she
might end up drowning. Instead she had cast a spell that allowed to her send
an eye into the ocean to follow Pepper. She was able to stay above the water,
but view what the eye was seeing. They eye was following closely behind Pepper
and Carrot. Saffron hoped that the eye wouldn't be noticed - for her sake and
Peppers.</p>
<p>Peppers broom had transformed and developed organic fins and propellers to
allow her to travel quickly under the water. She was able to zip along quickly,
with Carrot perched on the front of the broom.</p>

<p>PepperCarrot. A Novel by William Mckee</p>
<p>She sat at her workbench. Twirling the feather pen in her
hand. A Cat slept peacefully beside her.</p>
<p>The mailman approached the mailbox with caution. Warning:
Witch Property, the box read. He had been watching the
house since these new witches had moved in. Several nights
ago as he was chopping onions he noticed from his window
green smoke drifting out  from the property. He had concerns
for what mischief they were up to.
What was worse is it wasn't just a single witch that had
moved in - it was a group of them. Three adult witches and a
child. He had seen the lot of them leave the house on their
broomsticks. He had thought about approaching the house and
having a peak through the window but he was worried that there
might be traps - or that the witches return and cast a spell
on him.
The girl had been friendly. He had seen her walking down the
road with her ginger cat. He had been mowing his lawns (something
they needed to do) when she walked past his house giving
him a wave and yelling "Hello Neighbour, I'm Pepper".
Pepper had a basket containing mushrooms. She offered some
mushrooms to the man but he refused. She tried to talk to him
further but he rushed back inside like he was afraid of her.
The man stomped up his front door steps, opened the door and headed
inside.
The door slammed behind him.
Peaking out the window he watches as Pepper is steering at the
house. He closes the curt-ins and continues to peak out.
Pepper calls out to her cat which is distracted playing
with a moth, "Come on Carrot, Let's finish our walk".
The two continue to walk down the road.</p>
<p>The house might need some maintenance Pepper thought. She
the mailbox and looked out to her home in the distance.
The garden had grown wild. An ancient oak tree wrapped its
way through the house. Pepper had asked her godmothers
about clearing it. They were shocked and refused explaining
that the oak tree was in fact alive and they wouldn't dare
chop it.</p>
<p>Pepper had been given permission to mow the lawns. Maybe
if she maintained the house the neighbour wouldn't be
frightened of her anymore. She wasn't surprised when she
was told that they didn't own a lawnmower. 'Put your
training to use and use magic', Pepper was told. She spent
the morning looking through books for a spell that would
allow her to cut the grass. She found the perfect recipe.
The ingredients read: rose petals, cardamom, ginger, coriander,
hibiscus, red geranium, and powdered dragons tooth. All were
common herbs - except for the dragons tooth which was rare. Pepper
stepped out the back door and
headed towards the herb garden where the herbs grew. Reaching into
her pocket she pulled out a pair of secetares which she used to
cut the herbs. She hummed to herself as she works. The sky was turning
gray, a storm was coming. The Gods had predicted she was going to
make this spell. The first rain-dropped landed as Pepper finished
picking the herbs and took a step inside.
Pepper had picked the majority of ingredients she needed from the
garden. All she needed was the powdered dragons tooth. It was
in a glass container high in the shelf. Pepper climbed the ladder and
retrieved the glass container that contained the dragons tooth. She had
gone to a great deal to retrieve this - travelling around the world in
search of dragons and attempted to remove their teeth. In the end she
ended setting up a dragon dentist business and was overloaded with
toothache dragons that needed a tooth or two removed. Sadly she then
found out that the powdered dragons tooth didn't come from dragons but from
a plant. The Binomial name for Dragons Tooth was Lotus maritimus. It is part
of the genus Lotus. Pepper had to travel to South England for the plant. She
found it on a field in which cows were grazing. The plant had grown to a
height of 30cm.
The flowers were a pale yellow colour. The leaves in three's, 'clover'-like
but longer and terminating more suddenly at the far end.
Pepper learnt to make sure she knew what she was looking for before setting
out on future trips to retrieve ingredients.</p>
<p>Pepper had planted the dragons teeth that she had removed from the dragons
in order to build an skeleton army. She would order this army to help out with
her duty's around the house. Pepper watered the patch of garden where she had
planted the teeth twice a day but no skeleton had risen.</p>

A cautionous nature to giving authoritative figures information.
If the police raided only give name, date of birth, and
address. Pinned above the phone was the lawyers number.</p>
<p>The company was of interest to the police. They knew what it was
doing but cautioned about busting it. The model worked. Business
would be given back to the gangs if shut down.
