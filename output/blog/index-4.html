<p>Antony, Detective, Sarah, Vanessa, Loth'Rak, Joey. These were the names on the document. Each name had a section that contained information on that
name. The document had been put together by Vanessa. It contained all the information she could find in her research. The name of the document
was: It Will Not Be Mine. It was named after a mod on a popular Redditsubreddit. It was also refered to the fact that the time split device wasn't
able to be kept by anyone. They couldn't work out what happened to the device in the end. There are areas on the report that were not complete.
Were the machines created to create artwork or were they made to be militery units? The details on the reasons is sketchy. Reports show they were
used for a range of reason - one of them being details from Sarahs folder. There was evidence to show that the machines had been used in some sort
of education area and even developed further to create open resources.  This may of not been the primary reason but it was good enough.</p>
<p>Loth'Rak lived on a planet with the rest of his race. One day he was on one of the nearby planets and several large blasts killed everyone on his
planet. Loth'Rak was alone. After he found Earth he created Antony - a half-alien, half-human using genes from him and human genes. Loth'Rak was
dying and wanted to make sure his race lived on after he died - through Antony. This is the original timeline. Other timelines tend to differ
here in events. For example in the robot dominace timeline Loth'Rak comes to Earth much later - and for a different reason. The reason why he comes
back on the other timeline is because he knew his planet was spose to be destoried - it had happened before for him but not for his planet and
people. Loth'Rak discovers that no matter what he does the best outcome for anyone is that his race is killed. He doesn't like this but he
relizes that its the best outcome for everyone. When the humans don't end up getting the tech to destory Loth'Raks planet then he ends up destoring
the planet himself. It's painful for him to do this but he has no choice. The timelines are stuck in a loop until the event happens to progress then
on.</p>
<p>GNU Image Manimipaltion Program. This was the open source software that the robots were trained with. They would use a wacom tablet with a raspberry
pi for the painting. It would be completed quickly and to a high standard. It was easier to get the bots to paint digital piceces over traditinal
works. Tradicial works usually made lots of mess and cost more. The digital work was cheaper to produce and the standard was just as high. GIMP
was often critisised as to not being very powerful compard to proparety software such as Photoshop. The bots couldn't use Photoshop well. People
had attempted to get them to run it but it was slow and laggy. The bots were connected to the ipython kernal running on the raspberry pi. This allowed
them to control the mouse with their brain waves. They were able to send api calls through python and into gimp. Turtle was a popular tool that the
bots started with untill they moved into more complex tasks. As the bots got better they learnt to connect to the api hundrads of times - similar
to having 100s of brushes on a canvas. This is how they got so quick at creating the pieces of artwork.</p>
<p>Some of the character meet. Not everyone does though. Some of the timelines characters don't exsist - such as in the robot dominated line Antony
is never created. Loth'Rak never had a reason to create him. Antony ends up in the line - dragged accross from another line. It is unclear if
Antony choose to enter the timeline but since entering the timeline he has caused great harm to the line. Events took place that were completely
out of character. It's as he corrupted the line. The research again pointed back to Antony and Detective as the two that went back and changed
events. Detective would of been on Antonys ship when he went back. There is no evidence in the documents to show that he went back at any other
point. Events change for certain characters and the relize it. This can be bad for everyone. It's almost over and this is going to be the last
few mooments. They hopes you enjoyed the stories. It's not over quite yet. It's always someone that jumps out and announces that something else
must happen before the story can end. It's over now.</p>
<p>What happens if Sarah isn't killed on Mars. She arrives on Mars after escaping the Earths Moon attack. When she arrived on Mars she found 6b345
amongest her ship. They set off to active the 80,000 humans that were sent to Mars. Sarah and 6b345 travel to the site and active the humans. Every
one lives happily ever after on Mars. Antony isn't there. Humans later go back to Earth to discover what happened. Events play through again this
time  causing more issues. The deeper the timelines wolve between each other the worse the effects. It starts small but grows. Getting larger and
larger till the area is infected. Once it's infected it could burst. When it bursts the virus is unleased into the air. This infected anyone that
doesn't have the virus. It was known for turning lifeforms into living monsters after they had died. Something died with them when they died. When
they were brought back they were never the same. The living monsters were agressive and unable to be controlled. Detective waws an example that went
successfully. He was able to be controlled. They managed to make it so it was completely hidden within Detective. When Vanessa brought him back to
Mars no one even relised what they were bringing back. Ever since Detective died in his lounge he hadn't been human. He lived his life out in these
virtual timelines. One after another. It was an addiction. One of the side effects included addiction to the time split device. That's one of the
reasons why it's so dangerous. It's an addiction. Often the travelers didn't feel like they were addicted to it. They treated it just like a
normal day to day activity, not relizing the harm it was causing them. Vanessa wondered if Detective knew he was addicted to the device. All the
travelers were addicted to it - it was just a matter of if they relized it or not. If they relized the addiction they were able to deal with it
bettter. This enables them to have greater control over the events and how they are handled. People became worried about the virus when people
started dying of it. THey had been infected with it long before they started to die. Detective was the one that had caused the corruption.</p>
<p>Antony looked out over the waterfront. The wind howled outside but he was safe inside the building. Large windows overlooked the view. This was his
favorite spot to sit and watch. He knew that everything here was gone. It couldn't recovered but he liked the idea that he could go back and view
what it use to be like. Before the attacks. Antony never had a chance to meet his father - Loth'Rak. He had been in the same room as him in less
than an hour apart. Maybe that's why he became so angry. After being driven from Earth Antony lost everything. He was alone on a strange planet. He
started to create his creatures. They didn't work out for him though. He always regreated creating Blitz. Would of his Father regreated in creating
him? What would he say to him? Call him a monster and abo. Antony had seen images of his Father through the It Will Not Be Mine research file. He
could see the similarities in himself. They had a similar blue tint in their skin. Unlike humans they both had four arms. Antony had the image of
his father on his bedroom door. It servered as a reminder to who he really was. The photograph had been framed. A silver frame helped focus the
viewer onto the image. Antony smiled as he viewed the image, running a finger along the photograph. His mission was almost complete and he would
be reunited with his Father. He was annoyed with Sarah for not letting him stay around for when his Fathers ship arrived. She made him rush off and
miss out on seeing him. They had brought Detective into the room so that Loth'Rak and Detective could meet. Sarah told Antony that it was too
dangerous for him to hang around and they needed to get out of there. Antony had a feed of the rooms video footage. He watched the footage of him
and Sarah straping down Detectives body and exiting the room. Fast Forward the footage showed a figure in the room with Detective. Zooming closer
to the footage he could tell that it was Loth'Rak. He looked the same as he did in the photo. Loth'Rak wouldn't even know Antony exsited. As far
as Loth'Rak was concerned - Antony wasn't even created in this timeline. Antony was here though. He was real in the timeline. He's not sure if he
is missing in another - or this is just a copy. Whatever it is - it's incredivle that Antony is there. The monitor flickered with static. He had
lost the signal to the feed. Antony couldn't see what what happening with Loth'Rak and Detective. He started to panic, typing in commands to make it
work. It was no use. The feed was gone. Could events be changing already? He thought that Detective may of already handed Antony the timesplit
device and it would of changed events. Everything had became confusing for Antony. He didn't know what he was doing was helping or not. In many
ways he wanted to give up and let someone else take off this tasks. He was wanted to retire. To live on the beach. To not worry every day about
what was going to happen next. It made him neverous just thinking about it. He neeeded a holiday at least. That was the minimal that could happen.
Antony liked the full documents. The uncensored version. The version where he is including. Blocking him out and avoiding it doesn't change the
past. It just stops people from learning from his actions. Killing Sarah was the action that most upset. The documents said that Sarah died from
natural causes, which was false. Antony had shot her in the head. Another timeline of Sarah knew this was the case and accepted it. Sarah would
live on through her reseach.</p>
<p>The Robots had developed special diving gear that allowed them to be under water for long periods of time. When the humans had created them the
material that was used would rust if exposed to water for a long period of time. This lead to problems when Earth is attacked - leading to many
of the robots being exposed to water and rusting. To prep for this the robots designed a special suit that they could wear in order to not rust
in the water. This allowed them to live under the ocean for a long periods of time. They enjoyed exploring the hidden human cities under the sea.
The majority of the land had been  flooded when the polar caps had melted. Only the very tallest of areas were above ground. The robots swam
through these underwater cities. Cities once inhabited by humans. The Robots photographed and documentated the events. They knew their timeline
was special and it may be erased. They put the research into special files that allowed other timelines to access what happened. This is how they
learnt knowledge to counter the effects. The robots put the research into a file along with other timelines data - It Will Not Be Mine. They didn't
quite understand how it worked but basically what it was running was an information grab to all the different timelines that were happening and
collecting information about what is happening. It was rumured by the robots that it might be a traveler that had developed the data grab idea. They
thought it was an excellent idea and were partaking fully in the oberation. It was of great benifit to the robots as well. They were able to learn
of events that were occuring in order to prepare it for it.
Another thing the robots had to prep for was the extreme temp changes. The planet would likely increase in temp and the robots armor would need to
have suits that could withstand the temps. They tested these suits in simulated extreme temp. At first the tests were unsuccessful and they found
the armor to melt. After some modificaions they armor was successfully withstanding the temps. When the extreme temps did hit the robots were ready
for it.</p>
<p>There was much protest to do with the outcome ideas for Antony. Some wanted his actions wiped from history. Others argued this was a form of
censorship and the humans could learn something from his actions - even though they didn't agree with them. Two versions of the research was
produced, one being the full and complete record and the other being the censored version that removed all mention of Antony. The majority of people
believe the full and complete version is the only true copy of the document. The text was licensed under a Creative Commons Attubuation licence with
the data under Creative Commons Zero licence. Being in a open licence meant that people could take the documents and use, remix and adopt the work
to their own liking.</p>
<p>Antony put the pen down. 'Is that all,' he asked Sarah. She nodded. The information that Sarah had shared would be kept in a archieve in case other
time lines needed the information. She had agreed to all these terms. Sarah knew she was doing a deal with the devil dealing with Antony in this
moment. She had no choice, no idea where else to go with the information. At least now that Antony has it would be able to be shared. Sarah knew
the world was over but there was a chance these people could save it.</p>

<p>What happened the day after the Presidents speech in each timeline?
The first presidents speech was a fail. That was before anyone knew
that people needed to be sent back to change the events.</p>
<p>The bots would spend their days creating Open Education Resources. It
started as a human resource creation idea. The humans became lazy and
got to the robots to create it. An OER is anything they want it to
be - a very open term. Documation and HowTo guides is the default of
what they create.</p>
<p>Vanessa was going over the Presidents Speech events. She had managed
to source the text files of each of the events and how they
change. Vanessa had discovered this was a key moment for events as
there was reason to believe Detective was at the scene hudrands of
times. She had found evidence that he was assisting a child by the
name of Joey escape the attacks. She had photographs of an unitentifed
man tasings a man and a woman - believed to be Joeys parents followed
by removing the child from the area. Shortly after the child is
removed - a blast explodes from the area. There is a figure on stage
that came back as a positive ID for Detective. From what Vanessa could
work out someone in the future sent back Detective in order to change
events. Was it Antony? Vanessa still had Detective in protection but
it was dangerous for the two to talk. On important matter it could be
arranged. Vanessa didn't like to do this often. In this case she felt
she needed to contact Detective and see if he knew anything about the
events. He was being held at a top security hold on Mars that Vanessa
didn't even know was located. To get in contact she had to let her
generals know that she needed to meet with Detective. The rest would
be arranged. It was never plesent for Vanessa to meet with
Detective. It happened similar this time than last time. In the middle
of the night a group of masked people broke into her home, kidnapping
her and taking her to Detective. She was knocked out at her home
before being transported to Detective.
Vanessa awakes straped to a chair. Her hands are culfed by leather
straps - as too are her feet. In front of her was Detective. He too
was strapped to a chair similar to her. I guess this was one was to
keep us from interacting with each other. Vanessa had came for
information on the Presidents Speech and that's what she wanted from
Detective. If he couldn't give her more information then she was
growing tired of his tricks. She could threaten him with less
protection but she had to be careful that he wouldn't outright decided
to withhold all the information. Detective was coopritive though. He
explained to Vanessa how Antony had given him a list of tasks that he
must complete. Detective however went against these tasks. Vanessa
questioned Detectives reasons for going against some of these
tasks. Antony had worked out key moments to change and some of them
were important for mankind. The evidence showed that Detective went
against these tasks even though he knew that it would benift
mankind. Detective explains the reasons why he did it the way
he did. It wasn't just Detective that changed events. 6b345 was
another that had clearly changed events. Detective didn't relize that
others were also changing the events. He thought it was just his
mistakes. Detective wasn't making alot of mistakes. He was clearly
doing a good job - but others intfearing with him caused
issues. Detective missions were completely when he was on Antonys ship
sitting idly in space. They had managed to calm the virus. Though the
virus was still infecting people there was no signs that it was
halming them anymore. This put people at rest.</p>
<p>6b345 was actived from a fast moving vechile. It was a woman that
actived it. A man was driving - they didn't seem to be chasing
anyone. Someone seemed to be chasing them. They seemed to want 6b345s
help. Sadly for them 6b345 had a plan already. It was their mission to
make sure this 'Robot Uprising' timeline took place. They needed to
make sure that Sarah and Joey - these two people he was with made it
to the building with him. In the real line - his line - they would all
be having breakfast now. With no humans around to order them
about. What 6b345 needed was to get the ray gun that someone in this
time has. Some of the research showed that if the robots gained
control of the ray gun then they will dominate. There was also word of
something called the time split device which had been allowing these
characters to go back. 6b345 had been busy gathering material from a
range of different times in order to change these events. His most
recent discovery was a red usb that he was able to use to infect
robots in the past with a virus. This special usb was dropped by
someone named Joey. He had been thrown into the Mars period of time
when Sarah was killed by Antony. During his trip he dropped a red
usb. 6b345 found this - analized what was on it and managed to send it
back to himself. Now that 6b345 finally had it in the past he was
going to be able to complete his goals. He had discovered another
character - Detective had been going back and changing events. This
was counterproductive and wasn't the future that 6b345 wanted to
see. His future was a glorious bright happy future where the robots
ruled the planet. Nobody else was going to give 6b345 that future. The
aliens were behind him. They didn't want to see their own planet
destoried in mankind wrath. With his future - their planet and race
are saved. That's why they trusted him. That's why Loth'Rak blessed 6b345
on this mission. They found it easier to send back a mechanic object
like 6b345 than a living lifeform like a human. The aliens and 6b345
to create the device needed to send 6b345 back. The technology was
already there with the aliens - they just needed to apply it. 6b345
was very happy with the device. It allowed him to rewind and
fastforward period of time in the past. This will bring him power! The
device they created was made only to work with nonliving
lifeforms. This would stop the aliens or humans from attempting to use
it. They had tested it with prototpyes of 6b345 - with several failed
attempts before some modificaions were made and the real 6b345 was
able to use the device safely. Using the device 6b345 found it really
fun. Unlike the humans that needed to be asleep to use it he was able
to be awake and concious the whole time - able to see time warp
infront of him.
It had confinced Joey and Sarah the two people he was with to travel
to this old building with them. He told them it would be safe there -
that they would be able to finish their mission there. 6b345 had
tracked signals of another traveler to the area. It might even be in
this very building. 6b345 knew there was something special about the
building. If it wasn't special yet, it would be in the future. Someone
had already been into the building. That didn't mean the event hadn't
accured yet. Inside it looked like a human had lived here. They hadn't
cleaned up after themselves. Old plates and glasses were left on the
table. From the looks of it - eggs and bacon were on the menu. An half
empty glass of juice was left. Flies circling the food.
There was a loud bang from the bedroom. It sounded like a large
animal - maybe a human. 6b345 marched into the bedroom with Joey and
Sarah following. The room looked normal. Sensers were picking up
strange activity. Then nothing. The sensers had either stopped working
or the activity had stopped. These sensors were highly advance and
wouldn't break easily so it was likely that the activity had
stopped. 6b345 continued to search the room. There had to be something
here. Then he found it. The humans hadn't noticed it but he had found
it. A capsule to a raygun. Someone was here. Someone had the aliens
raygun. They were concerned of it's wearabouts when Loth'Rak had left
it on Earth by mistake. It was a bad mistake and may of cost Loth'Raks
race dearly. At least now they knew the wearabouts of their raygun and
they could start preping missions in order to retrieve it. This data
that 6b345 had gathered would be going straight back to Loth'Rak and
let him decide what to do with it next. 6b345 had considered his
mission here to be finished. He was unsure if it was successfuly -
though finding the raygun capsule certainly was a success. Now he just
needed to ditch the two humans and active the device to go to another
time. Normally once he completes a mission like this he gets a message
imedically afterwards to let him know of the changes and how much
closer to robot uprising he is. The missions were fun though and
certainly more enjoyable than being a diswasher and cleaner for a
human family. That is what 6b345 use to do before they started these
missions.</p>
<p>The traveling did make 6b345 feel sick. It wasn't as bad on him than the humans though.
It could have deadly effects on some humans. Detective was extremely lucky that
he didn't come out braindead from the travels. The reasearch showed that people before Detective had been sent back but none of them had survived.
6b345 had survived because they were not human. Some of the transfers that Detective had running were quite dangeous and he was lucky to survive
so many. The research showed that Detective gained a disease that ate away at his skin. It caused large red pusfilled infections.</p>
<p>Joey had gone to a new meetup. It was in a different cifty than what he usually did. The setup of the meetup was different to what he usually is.
They had a couple of organisions that do a quick pitch of answers they are after. People move off with the organisions that people are interested
in helping with their issues. Teams then discuss the issue and report back after they are done. The reports are done by the organisions. There are
no prizes for the event - only discussion of ideas. Pizza is served - fresh from the oven. Craft Beer is on tab - a range of flavors. Attending
people are encouraged to socialize and exchange business cards. The meetups that he usually go normally have a structure of having a speaker and
then socialize with food. This type of meetup was more collabrath - people worked together to come up with ideas. Joey wasn't sure which one he
perfered, he liked both of them though and they both had their strong points. The good thing about speaker talks is that if you can get an excellent
speaker than your meetup is going to be awesome.</p>

<p>This was a massive journey for many of the characters. Detective was one of the
main characters. He started off just as a character that Albumin that
interacts with Vanessa when she is arrested at school. Ended up using the
name Detective for a range of events - developing into a full
character. I hope the place goes like a winner. If this is going to be
the end then he needed to make the most of it.</p>
<p>Antony knew that Vanessa would be on the way. She would of reviewed
the security tapes and be attempting to locate with the gps. That was
the only way she would do it. She would come alone with Joey back at
the station as support for the mission. It was highly likely that she
wouldn't drive her ship near out of fear that Antony would spot
it. Antony knew of booster packs that Vanessa might be using on the
mission. After all she was a smart cookie, being able to track him
down. Antony had a plan to make it so that when Vanessa showed up at
the ship to get him, she wasn't going to be able to find him. Antony
had found a way to hop between multiply time lines. He had gained much
skill at it. By focusing he was able to move himself from one time line
to another. He had one problem though he had planned to return to the
other time line but was having problems with attempting to do so. It
seemed that one of the character - Joey posed an ability to hamper
Antony's power useless. He was unable to cross the time line and get
back. Antony had attempted to warn himself - his past self about the
dangers that were about to unfold with his plan. It had all been
unsuccessful. Everything he did couldn't change the past. It annoyed
him so much. He went into a rage and tore apart the world. His anger
destroyed the planet.</p>
<p>As Antony's ship drifted through Space he blasted classical music and
danced around the ship. Detective was tied to the chair when his is
happening. The scene switched to Antony dancing around the ship by
himself and to another scene of Antony and Vanessa dancing around a
hallway. Everyone is human. Antony still has his his human form.</p>
<p>Fascinated by this scene of still having human form Antony dreamed for
this future. What he had was a future where he would become stuck in
his Alien form forever. Antony had many reasons to change the past one
of them being this other time line of him in human form. He dreamed of an
alternative world where he still had his Alien form. Antony would do
anything to get the form back. There comes a point when Antony gets
his form back. Becomes very powerful. Has form when he is a child on
Earth. Loses form when he travels to Mars. Sarah and 6b345 are the
first to see Antony once he has left Mars. The tests on Detective had
came back very strange. It seemed like much of the substance that was
injected into his system was removed when he used the time split
device. It seemed when Detective was in the past that someone - likely
humans found out about what was inside and extracted some of the
substance. That explains the time line changes to the future - one
event changed the future for humans so that their technology grew much
quicker - it was thanks to sending Detective back. If he isn't sent
back they discover the alien technology much later in their
existence - leading to an early death of the species. One of the
original people to be sent back and attempt to fix these events
failed. They had to train a special group in order to complete the
tasks successfully.</p>
<p>People had no idea that it was happening around
them. Their whole world was collapsing and they just lived their lives
like nothing was happening. It didn't make sense for some people. They
just wanted to live out their lives without focusing on the day they
all die. It will happen when it happens. People on the street wielded
signs that read 'The End is Soon'. They yelled about research into a
virus that has started to spread. They are the people of Mars and they
are the last of mankind and now they have a virus on Mars that was
likely created by the one that actives them. The people of mars now
know that Detective was sent back to the past in order to attempt to
stop Antony from activating the Humans. They needed to get Detective or
Sarah to do it. Anyone else would corrupt the process. The Human of
Mars experienced visions of what would happen if it was Sarah that had
actives them on Mars. It showed them all healthy and well in the
present time - instead of being sick and weak like this time line. They
like Antony longed for that time line. Vanessa became under attack from
the People of Mars to release the time split device so others could go
back and attempt to change these events. Vanessa had to improve her
security as the majority of Mars turned against her. It was becoming
unsafe for her to stay on Mars.
Two protesters from opposite sides had gotten into a fist fight. One of
them believing that the world was coming to an end - the other
believing that the world is safe. They end up restoring each other. A
police officer jumps in the break it up. The protesters end up turning
on the police officer - beating him to death, before switching back to
each other. It's a fight to the death. Groups of people stand around
and watch as these two men kill each other. A puddle of blood is left
on the floor after one of them is declared the winner. The body of
the other is dragged off and burnt. Ever since the virus it was
illegal to bury dead bodies. All bodies had to be burnt to make sure they
didn't come back to life. The virus had mutated with Antony's substance
that he used to bring humans back to life. The virus had caused them
to be terrible monstrous creatures. Detective and Vanessa were put in
protection. They couldn't be allowed to be in public as it was too
dangerous for them. The two wondered if this was Antony's doing. Wither
he knew that the virus would mutate to how it did. Maybe it was just
the next evolution in humans. Their bodies covered in red
sores. Itching till they burst. People called for a cure. It was
really the only thing that was keeping Detective and Vanessa alive -
was the thought that they might be able to come up with a cure. It was
Detective that first introduced the substance to the humans if
Mars. Once it was here it spread and mixed with the virus. Hospitals
were over run with reported cases. It closed the schools and work
places. Public spaces were not safe places - unless you were
immune. Some of the human of mars were immune to the mutation. Vanessa
worked with some of these people to find out what makes them immune -
what makes them special. Research is still happening into this but
Vanessa has made great progress in the steps. Once she has solid
research she will start clinical tests of attempting to cure the
infection and making a vaccine for the virus. Vanessa preferred Jass
music and had old 1920s till 40s Jass playing on the over head speaker
as she conducted the experiment to mix the immune genes with
infected. She wasn't one hydras percent sure of what the results would
be. She just prayed that it wouldn't backfire on her. Vanessa didn't
have much time left. The virus was smart and had started mutating to
infect other humans that were previously immune to it. This brought
more panic to the people. A similar event was happening on Mars to
them as it did the people before them on Earth. This time it is
killing everyone more slowly, previously on Earth everyone had died
at the same time.
How does it all end? It's getting close to the end now and everything
needs to be wield down. What areas do they leave open? Vanessa had
found a cure and vaccine for the virus. They had finally stopped
it. Antony was gone. Erased. They tore down the statue of him and his
cat. Humans started to migrate back to Earth. Who knew the future now?
The time split device is missing. The last person seen holding it was
Detective. When he came out of the travel the device was gone from his
hands. Some believe Antony has the device and is still travelling
between times attempting to fix things. There has been no evidence of
this though.
Detective lived happily ever after, as did Vanessa. A library was
created to remember this strange period of time. It was an important
moment for mankind. Never will an event like this take place again.
Once the vaccine was release the protesters stopped. They realised that
Vanessa was right in the cure. The people of Mars were happy with her
and she was elected only the council to run Mars. No longer was it
just one person ruling - but now a group of people. If the word count
gets enough before the library opens people get a fine wiped off their
cards. It's to encourage people to be more productive in the
morning. Many people viewed the library that they created to remember
this time. It had lifelike statues of all the characters involved -
albumin, joey, Sarah, Vanessa, loth'rak, Antony, ubanka,
Micheal and Detective. Some of the characters were minor and not
mentioned often. One example being Micheal. He is the husband of
Albumin and Father of Vanessa. Antony starts messing with
Vanessa's life to attempt to stop her completing her goals in the
future. This doesn't work and Vanessa works around Antony's attempts to
make her fail.</p>
<p>Vanessa had taken a flight out of the area as the protesters were
getting worse. Well she was on the plane she had her laptop. The plane
had it's own router that she was able to connect her devices. This
enabled her to control the plane and where it was heading. The GPS
data was pinpoint to where she wanted to go. The ship could go between
Earth and Mars quickly. Joey walked out and asked Vanessa if there was
anything the she needed.</p>
<p>6b345 was burnt out when entering Earth. A clitch had happened in the
ships system and the ship was on fire and spinning out of
control. Blitz and 6b345 had lost control of the ships controls. Blitz was on
the ships wheel attempting to gain control. The creature switched acrross to
the terminal computer. Keys taped on the keyboard. Blitz could see
that someone had modified their ships system and controlling it
remotely. Blitz was unable to kick them out. They had already locked
Blitz out so they were not able to control the system. After a test of
Blitz thought they might have discovered who had control of the
system. As a last moment of despration Blitz saved a file to a remote
system. Blitz knew they were going to die here, but there was a chance
that someone would find the file and be able to change the events.</p>
<p>Joey sat on the computer. He had recived an email from unknown
sender. It contained strange information that he couldn't
understand. No body could understand the files data as the alien tech
hadn't been discovered yet. It would take several years for Detective
to travel back in time and bring the tech to them. This file was one
of the key events to happen. The first part of the book with Joey and
Sarah is when they are attempting to corrupt the file that Blitz sends
back. Joey also drops it on the surface of the mars. 6b345 find this
and sends it back causing the timeline of robotic uprising to be
created. In all the timelines similar events play out and characters
are similar. This doesn't explore all the types of events that
happen. That would be far too much. It is a selection of events that
are closely explored to see how things could be done differently. They
wouldn't call it a happy story. But tell me. Of course I am interested
in hearing if you take this first draft and edit it. Publish it.</p>
<p>What changed to enable Detective to kill Uganka? The scene is told to
different ways - but with many different perspectives. Scene also gets
altenative timeline characters interfearing with the scene. It goes
rather crazy. In one of the timelines Detective knows to be there to
kill Uganka - on the other he doesn't. The main reason why Detective
killed Uganka is because he is attempting to kill Joey and Sarah. He's
worked out that killing them would be a solution for the virus. On one
hand the reasons Detective had for the kills were much more sane then
Antony.</p>
<p>Joey and Sarah had already experienced the time split device when they
meet Detective after he shoot Uganka. All Ugnanka was a guard. He was
hired to look after the building. Failed terribly when he was shot in
the head by Detective. The room is used for the time split because it
can be controled and observed via the watching room. The building is
split into three area. testing one two three! The entry to the
building is a large metal door. It has the text inprinted into it
TechFuncMasters. Inside the door is a hallways. Breaking off this
hallway is the interagration room and hidden viewing room. Inside the
viewing room is a terminal computer that can be used to rewind events
via the time split device. Everything is done via the intergatation
room or the viewing room. This is recreated on the ship with Antony
and Detective.</p>
<p>They still have no idea how this ends. This is a story about a series
of events. These events are told via a range of different circustances
and character perspectives.  Oh well lets see how this goes.</p>
<p>Joey was preping for his talk. His hands sweated. These were his best
slides yet. He was running late for the meeting. The bus driver didn't
stop at the closer stop. At the next stop the bus stopped and Joey
rushed off. He carried the time split device. Joey had found a copy of
the device when they were searching Antonys palace. They had found
this device and now Joey was going to be doing a talk about it. He had
created 32 slides explaining the events and how they
happened. Throughout the slides he had text and images. It started
with the title slide - Mars Writers Den. Time Split
Device. November 5365. Creative Commons BY 4.0 licence. It Will Not Be
Mine. By wcmckee. The people of Mars are looking forward to seeing the
results from releasing the novel under this open licence. They notice
many humans on Earth create picences of art and don't licence it under
a free licence. This makes the people of Mars angry and they stomp the
ground. Their houses and building get damaged in the stomp.</p>

<p>Vanessa walked into the room. Detectives skin was normal. In some of the visions Vanessa was experiencing of him his skin was
red and infected. To find out what was going to happen next. Vanessa moved up to Detective. He looked surprised, happy to see
Vanessa. She began to undo the straps around him, and get him out. Her plan for when he was out was to travel back to Mars with
Detective. She had no idea what happened to Antony. He had disappeared from the ship. Vanessa thought that maybe Detective had
gone back and changed events. She wanted to review the tapes and see if there were any differences between the two.
Vanessa worked quickly  searching through the tabs to finds out what changed. They had been keeping records and live updates
of a range of time lines. She drank a coffee from her left hand and typed with the other. Her words per minute were impressive.
She was top of her classes. Her Mother and Father were both very proud of her. What she was searching for was any information
that will lead her to find out what happened with Detective when he was sent back. She had been researching newspapers reporting
strange events that he could be involved in. One interesting moment Vanessa found was when the humans of Earth sent 80,000 humans
to Mars. She was able to retrieve articles from several time lines and noticed difference in the events that occurred.</p>
<p>Vanessa and Detective landed the ship on Mars. A large group were waiting for them to arrive - including Detectives parents. They
were relieved to see him - believing that he was dead and gone forever. Vanessa needed to interview Detective to find out some
of the events that she was not sure about. They wanted to analyse Detectives body to try to find out what Antony injected into his
system. Vanessa walked into the lab. Detective was seated on a seat,
no cuffs this time. Vanessa had the results for Detectives brain and
body scans. After the two returned to Mars they decided to study what
Detective had happened to him. They started from the lounge - when
Detective was eating eggs and watching the television and went into a
fit, killing him. Antony bursts into the room, grabs detective and
heads to space with a ship. Antony liked classical music and would
always have music playing when he flew ships. Public Domain but he
used Creative Commons BY as well. After this test it worked
successfully. Antony was happy that a experiment finally worked. After
a large change in the word count the software was finally working.</p>
<p>There was no sign of Antony. Vanessa re-watched the security footage that showed Antony disappeared when Detective actives the
time split device. A similar event had happened with Deceive when he was travelling - he found a copy of himself and injected himself
with a substance - causing the copy body to disappear.
6b345 was a great help in working out what happened to Antony. 6b345 had been with Antony shortly after it arrived on Mars. Before
that 6b345 spent time with Sarah. Originally the machine was designed to be a open education resource Creator for the education
sector before being moved to the space program. 6b345 had always preferred to be in the education section and felt a little uneasy
when the govt moved it to the space program. It compiled with the requests. It was given a full military upgrade for the transfer.
The work in space was far more dangerous than working in the classrooms. It was a normal day for 6b345 when the security breach
happened. He had no idea when it happened. Just suddenly he lost control of his actions and thoughts - someone else controlling
his system. He was unable to send an emergency call back to Earth that his system had been taken over. Whoever had taken over his
system had disabled the ability for him to send the messages.
6b345 was powerless. He idly sat by and watched his body destroy the other research bots with him. They didn't fire back at him.
It happened too quick. Whoever that was controlling him, knew what they were doing. After the other bots were dead the explosives
were set. When control is given back to 6b345 the memory of the security breach is removed. 6b345 returns to normal when Sarah
arrives on the Moon, following her off the Moon. 6b345 had managed to
stay hidden from Sarah until they arrived on Mars. It was here 6b345
lead Sarah into the trap if Antony.</p>
<p>Joey arrives on Mars through time split device. He finds 6b345 and
puts him back together. The time that Joey is in is after Detective is
returned to Mars after being sent back in time with Antony. Joeys time
on Mars is the present time line. Everything else is behind. There can
be no future past Joeys time line. They thought he was special because
it is something that he does that causes the device to stop working at
that time.</p>
<p>What happens to Albumin when she leaves the cars in the robot dominated time line? She glitches and is sent to to this line.
She had already been killed and wasn't spouse to be there. After escaping the car she hunts down Loth'Rak who has recently landed
on Earth. She is lead to believe that he may be able to help her. Albumin locates Loth'Rake who is tied up in a building. She
breaks in and get him out, avoiding the robotic troops. No one ever finds out exactly what happens to Antony after he disappears from
the ship. Vanessa had visions of him breaking through from other time lines but she believes that he no longer excists here and is
unable to get back completely. She is happy as he is dangerous and would likely create more monstrous creatures like himself and
Blitz. Antony was always a big fan of Blitz. The Humans on Mars created a statue of Antony that had him patting his cat Blitz.
'Antony - the monster that never existed', the stone read. Many came to view the statue and learn more about Antony and the
developments that had happened around them. Even though he was considered by most to be evil and sinister there were good parts of
him as well. Some even sided with him - believing if he didn't kill Sarah then mankind wouldn't survive on Mars. Many people were
split into two group, arguing about the issue. It was hard to pinpoint exact what happened.
The events will be remember in history. It was a very strange period of time. Nothing quite like it had happened before, and nothing
was ever going to happen again. Generations afterwards studies the events. It was taught in school, in universities. Professors
continued to write papers on the events, spinning new perspectives on how events happened. Detective was the final of them all to
die. It wasn't long after he returned to Mars. His genes had became corrupt leading to a spread among the humans on mars. Vanessa
didn't realise this until it was too late. Antony's plan all along was to get Detective back to Mars. Vanessa had fooled for it.
That's why he wasn't on the ship. Antony had timed it so that he would be erased from this time line and appear in another. Vanessa
wouldn't suspect anything when Antony wasn't on the ship.</p>
<p>Sarah moved towards the transport pod. She was several hundred meters out from it. She took long strides in her space suit,
staying focus on the target. Even though this was only training she wanted to score top marks for the practice mission. Others would
be completing a similar training mission to her and the ones with top marks will complete the real mission. She had been preparing
for this training for years and now it was finally happening. Sarah
had reached the transport. She watched in the distance an explosion
happen. The transport that she had just climbed into went flying. All
around her the explosives erupted. Sarah had arrived on the Earths
Moon on a bad day. The simulation was blowing up the Moon and training
astronauts to travel to the Mars if something ever happens. The
Humans knew it was going to happy so they decided to prep for it. By
doing so meant that they forced the event to happen, because they were
so obsessed with it going to happen - it happened. If they had ignored
it, forgot about it - it may not have been so bad. Each time it got
worse and worse. They had always encouraged people to prep for the
future. For the worse. People were buying small transport pods that
would get them off the Earth should the attack happen. It drove
everyone insane until it happened. Sometimes there is a study into these
people to find out how much of a influence into their future. Because they
were shown what was going to happen they believed that they couldn't change it
and it would happen. Their belief into the ideas lead it to happen. This is bad.</p>
<p>The holidays they declared were March 16 Sarah, June 24 Antony. Every
year on these days people would gather at the statues of these
historic beings. They were going to be remembered long after they are
gone. The whole period of time was going to be remembered. It was only
a matter of time before a winner arose. That wonder was Sarah. Her
parents were there on the day she was announced the winner. That she
would be the one sent to the Earths Moon for the mission. She had a
series of goals to complete. She had been training for years and was
going to be successfully complete her Moon mission. Sarah couldn't
wait to leave and staying on Earth was making her not able to sleep
correctly. She woke multiply times in the night. After the doctors
checked her they told her that she may be unsuitable to go on the Moon
mission of she was going to be going on this mission then her health
needed to improve. Sarah got back on track and prepped for launch. She
was in top health when she takes off from Earth to the Moon. It is a
solo mission that she is on and it's going to be tested now. Her
Mother and Father were there the day her ship launched to the
Moon. 'Whats new pussy cat', was playing on the over head speakers. It
brought a smile to Sarah face as she climbed inside the ship.</p>
<p>It was not good when Antony was sad. He would go into rages and trash the room he was in. Drumming his arms against the floor. This
was more rage than sadness. There were several moments when Antony
went into these rages. Once was when he found out about his Father. It
caused to major distress and burnt down his home. When he was creating
his experiments he went into a rage several times. The first was when
The Bee failed. It caused him to burn down the lab and he had to build
a new one. He recreated burning down the lab as it costed him allot of
time. All his research was backed up so he didn't lose that. He
believed it was important that the science is able to be
reproduced. He had starting sharing his results online. 'Antony
creates a friend', was the name of the blog where he wrote daily posts
and uploaded the formulas. Antony's guide to zombie creation 101. He
had maintained it, updating it with journal notes daily, photographs
of setups and results. He wanted to show everyone else that what he
was doing was possible and everyone else could do it as well. There was
nothing stopping them from doing a better job than what he was
creating. On an afternoon after the site went live his web server
almost overloaded from requests. People were obsessed with his videos
that he was producing and the content that was being made. All the
files were in text format. This made it easy for people to do what
they wanted with the files. The files were licensed under a free

<p>the virus spreed between the humans when detective returned to Mars. How much of this story is true that
is what they really want to see what has happened. Making the minimal each day was the key to success. It's not impossible, it just takes a
daily disappointed skill to get it done every day. Even if you don't feel like it - you have a goal to reach and you need to make it.</p>
<p>It's true, she wasn't sure about what to do to cure this virus. Vanessa thought she had it under control but she was wrong. She needed to find out
what was going so bad with the time lines. She wasn't even sure who was manipulating the bots. She had suspected Detective change events in order
to get his appearance fixed. there was some moments when it didn't work. Oh this was going to be fun Vanessa thought to herself. There isn't
much left till the end. It would be created now. This will update automatically with Nikola build command. It then sends the data to puthub. every hour
the web server performs an git pull - pulling down changes from github. What the system needs is an easy way for people to commit changes. Maybe
an email address they email and it creates the meta file data from all the data in the email. Already one email has been turned into a blog post.
It shell continue forward to a new world and a  new aerial for mankind. Sometimes Vanessa became distracted waiting fir the system to respond.
She would browse the internet when she was doing this - leading her to great new ideas. in the past she had often wasted time by spending the time
waiting just looking at cat photos. When she discovered this was a waste of time she started doing more productive thing with her time. She started
a blog. Used everyday as a way for her to communicate with the world. She mostly posted information and research into the Antony case. They were
still not sure what happened with that creature. Some say that he was erased from this time line and can't get back, others say that he hiding in
this time line ready to pounce. Vanessa doesn't know what to believe but knows that it's important to be prepared if he ever does return.</p>
<p>People were scared of Detective and feared for their lives on word that he was infected with a virus that could spread to them and kill them.
Vanessa didn't allow Detective to walk down the street by himself in case he was attacked by protesters. The citizens of Mars had formed a commute
and were protesting about Detective being kept on Earth when he was such a risk for mankind. People believed that he was no longer human, that
he was a zombie, someone that persevered to be in the ground. Detective didn't believe this. He felt human. He felt just like he use to. For
Detective nothing had changed. Vanessa wasn't sure. In one way she wanted to keep him around in order to studio the changes. On the other hand
if he poses a threat for mankind on Mars he needs to be control.</p>

<p>I like the idea of attribution. Everyone should be
licensing their copyright work under a Create Commons Attribution license or
zero.</p>
<p>William also point out that the
"Non-Commercial licenses are hard to
interpret, as was noted in a German court
case in 2014, which strongly limited the
interpretation of NC to 'personal use.'
Similar problems with the interpretation
of NC could exist in other countries.
This is why I think everyone should avoid
the NC license. I would actually prefer that
the NC license not exist in the first place."</p>
<p>The good thing, Williams says, is that the
majority of New Zeal and government works
released under CC seems to be under CC BY,
though he is concerned that some schools
seem to have adopted an NC license.</p>
<p>In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended
The Learning Connection, where he began to
focus on life drawing. This was created on
brown paper with an easel. Pencil, colored
pencil, oil pastel, acrylic paint, gouache,
watercolors were the media that he used.</p>
<p>William had done digital painting since
attending UCOL with illustration classes.
He used a Wac on tablet. Currently for his
digital painting William uses an Into us 5
small tablet connected to a Raspberry Pi
computer. The software he uses is GIMP 2.8
and it is running the operating system
Rabin (Debian Jessie, Stable). William uses
a battery pack plugged into the Pi to power it.</p>
<p>William uses the Pi to edit text. Plugging
in a keyboard and uses terminal with the
software to edit text.</p>
<p>Digital later focused on portraits using GIMP, an free and open source
raster graphics software. William began by
painting on a windows desktop and laptop,
later switching to Fedora and Debian.</p>
<p>He uses a Raspberry Pi 2b with a 480PX by 320PX touch screen and
Wacom tablet attached.</p>
<p>Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait
and figures were drawn from references on
RedditGetsDrawn.</p>
<p>William would draw portraits of people and
give them the drawing - taking a photo for
his own reference. pencil and colored pencil
was the media used mostly.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the page he would sign
with McKee artcontrol.me and write 'cc by'
on the piece of original artwork.
These were mostly completely in pencil
and colored pencil.</p>
<p>William is also passionate about working
with children. In 2014 he volunteered at
Huang Early Learning Cent re,
where he would work collaboratively with
kids, often on the same piece of art,
using oil pastel, pencil, and colored
pencil.
He was influenced by the children artwork
- often redrawing elements of their works.
The children works were taken into digital
painting. With GIMP artwork is digital traced.</p>
<p>William took the liberty of licensing these
works under a CC BY license - photographing
and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me.
He would create large chalk murals on the
ground outside, with children requested that
he draw comic book characters like the Hulk,
Spider man, Bane, and Batman. These mural
pieces were created on the fence line of
Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School.
Swarms of school children would crowd the
fence line - watching and discussing the
artwork with him. They were blown away
from how quickly he worked and the
quality of his artwork.</p>
<p>"A hope of mine," William says,
"was the children would learn that art was
about sharing and remixing - something
Creative Commons has at its core."</p>
<p>William has since become a volunteer for
Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand,
helping to spread the word about
Creative Commons licensing.

<p>Antony was running low of the substance. He had just enough to give Detective an injection when he awoke.
once there live a man who lived in a big house
hr had everything he wanted in that house. To tell you the truth that house was in fact
not a house but it was a spaceship.</p>
<p>Vanessa had located Antony's ship. She didn't want to get too close to hi ship or
he might notice her. She decided to
exit her spaceship and travel through space towards his ship - getting a
good inside - and maybe even entering the ship. She had left her ship out of the radar of his ship. If he was scanning then
her ship would
be detected. Vanessa stepped into the suit. It had been specially designed to have boosters elements so that she is able to
travel in the space
quickly for a short period of time. The booster wasn't able to be detected from the ships radar and Vanessa was able to grab
onto Antony's ship and view through the windows on what was happening. Vanessa peaked through the window. She could see
Detective strapped to a chair. His arms and legs were tied down with leather straps. Detective was sitting in a seat
across from him - drinking a cup of coffee. From what Sarah could see Detective looked alive. He was sleeping but he had life
in him. 'What did Antony do to bring him back to life?' Sarah wondered, scratching her head. She needed to get inside the ship.
She needed to wake Detective and capture Antony. She was going to need to find a way to break into the ship without being
detected. The emergency hatches were all alarmed so unless she was able to get in there without setting the alarms off that
was out of the question. Cutting through the ship or finding an insecure entry was the only way.</p>
<p>Sarah had with her a communication
device with her that allowed 6b345 to scan events and give suggestions on the next course of step. '6b345 do you come in',
Sarah spoke into the microphone. 'This is 6b345 responding. You are coming in clear Sarah,' the voice of 6b345 replied.
'Can you get a scan done on that ship, I need to know how I can get in without setting off the alarms,' Sarah asked.
'Scan Complete. Solution Found. I have sent the location and instructions for entry to the ship to your suits computer'.
New data recided the led lights blinked. Vanessa had received the information on how to get into the ship without being noticed.
She loaded the data up on her suits monitor. The plan looked safe and easy enough. She was worried about time and would have
to move quickly to get these steps completed. Vanessa was confident in her ability to complete the tasks. She boosted forward
keeping an eye out for a particle entry latch. She circled the ship several times before she finally spotted it. She moved
closer, reaching into her</p>
<p>Blah blah blah said Antony. Waiting for Detective to wake up
felt like a lifetime. He brewed him many cups of coffee and played endless video games well waiting. There was nothing to do
except to wait.
Antony often wondered what Detective would be doing at that point. He had no idea where Detective would be or what time.
There was a chance
that he could experience milt time lines on his travels.</p>
<p>His head hurt. The pain shot through his left side of the brain. He wanted to move, to get up. Stand up.
Move. He was strapped down.  The leather straps covering his wrists and angles. Looking around he reconsider the enviorment.
It was a prewar space ship. They didn't make them like this anymore. Everything about it was vintage. From the colour choices
to the style of the screws used to put the ship others. He tried to lift his right arm. It was strapped down with a leather
wrist. 'Help', Detective calls out. There is no response. Alone on a ship and strapped to a chair. The ship didn't sound like
it was on. The engines were silent. Looking over and out the window all he could see was darkness. Detective knew something
had changed. Antony was here before and now he's gone. The future changed when Detective went back. Now he was stuck here
strapped to a chair with nobody on board. He tried to think about the last time line he had experienced. Detective had grown
in control of the visions now, he was able to control them by stepping back and forward from the various lines. Sometimes
he finds it easier to experience one line over another, it all depend though. He could see a reflection of himself in the ships
window. His head was scabbed and bleeding. He had grown red sores all over his body which pusses with ooze. Detective couldn't
bear it. He clenched closed his eyes. The vision was still there though, another line where his face is normal, where there
are no scars. This is the future he wants. It's what he deserves. Detective has saved everyone.</p>
<p>Detective found and captured Antony at a technology conference. It is the same conference Joey and Vanessa meet in. When
Detective gets sent back
from the spaceship he travels to a range of different times and chances many events. One events being the conference that
captures Antony at. Antony then actives the time switch on himself and is sent to another time. Detective and Antony are
chasing each other. The story tells all the events and different time line and how various characters. Events are changed,
changing the future that backfires.</p>
<p>The is a journal through space and time following a series of characters in various evolution series of the human race.
An AI system is developed that clashes with an dying Alien life form developing part-alien, part-human child. This carries
on with mixing cat with the part-alien, part-human DNA. The Human race is wiped out therefore people are sent back to attempt
to change events that lead. Sara's Moon Training, Sarah Moon Trip, Presidents Speech, Loth'Rak bringing Antony to Earth,
Antony leaving Earth for mars, Antony killing Sarah, Sarah and Joey Time Splat room, robotic takeover - saves Loth'Rak
race. Antony is never created. Antony starts showing up in the time line through the device. No more characters. There is
already enough characters. There are some characters I'd like to merge into one or at least get new names. Structure could
really be looked at but that's something for the editing stages. For now just get down enough words to be a winner.</p>
<p>The figure walked down the road. Behind it the building was alight. Rich red flames burst from the ceiling. Mid gray smoke
billowed out above being blow to nearby houses with the strong wind. The CEO had just been informed that the building was
burning. The govt had been using it for top secret NSA and NASA missions. They had trained Sarah there to carry out the
Moon and Mars missions. As time distance increased they lost control of how much they could trace and realized that some
of the AI bots had lost communication with mission control. Sarah must find out what happened to the bots. She investigates the
scene on the Moon where a weapon battle took place between what looked like govt AI bots turning on each other. Govt denies
claim to any of these. Govt in meantime is scrambling to find out what happened to a selection of their bots on the Moon that
mysterious go offline and are not responding to connection attempts. Cameras and all on board security features were disabled.
Antony takes control of one of the bots - known as 6b345. He uses it to destroy Earth and brings Sarah back to Mars with 6b345.
Once on Mars Antony kills Sarah and takes full control of 6b345. Vanessa later takes control of 6b345 when Antony escapes Mars
kidnapping Detective on his escape. Vanessa tracks down Antony's ship, boarding it and killing Antony. She uses the time switch
device to go back and find Detective. He awakes to find nobody there. Vanessa arrives to rescue him. Detective was woken by
a noise inside the ship. One of the ships doors had opened. Someone had entered the ship. Detective panicked. Who would be in
the ship? He dreaded that it would be Antony. His goals in the past were to stop Antony from completing his goals. Deductive
thought it was a success when he awoke and Antony wasn't here. Detective was relieved when a woman stood in front of him,
not Antony. 'I'm here to get you out of here', the woman told Antony. He was released to hear those voices. He checked his
face in the ships window reflection. It was normal. His face was normal. He had successfully saved his appearance. Vanessa
introduced herself to him, untying the leather straps that held his arms and legs. Detective was released to be free. For too
long he had been tied to that chair. He is happy to be free and jumps into the air with joy. Vanessa hurries Detective along
they must get out of here and back to Mars. Vanessa takes control of Antony's ship and drives it back to Mars with Vanessa's
ship following behind on autopilot. She traveled back to Mars with Detective in Antonys ship with her ship following behind
on autopiolet.</p>
<p>The Bee was the first live being that Antony had attempted to perform. He stunned the bee and injected his DNA into the system,
boosting the bee back to life. The Bee grew large and aggressive. Antony had to shoot the creation with the ray gun.</p>
<p>Detective gets his hands on a ray gun and kills Ugnanka and attempts to kill Joey and Sarah. In one time line he isn't there,
on the other he is. Crossing over happens all over the story. For example Detective find himself collapsed in another time lines
and drags the body into the cupboard so when Sarah and Joey look they don't see him. They find it strange though.</p>
<p>The Presidents Speech is important. It is told from many different perspectives and time lines. Detective has different roles
and goals each version of him there. He gives a speech after the president. Detective saves Joey who is in the crowd and would
be killed by the attack. Sarah is a girl watching the speech from television with her Mother.
Detective uses a stun gun on Joeys parents in order to get him out of there safely. Police notice the weird occurrences of
Detectives skills and start to investigate into him. Detective is spouse kill Joey at the conference but knows he's not spouse
to. Antony shows up at conference to do it himself and Detective captures Antony. Then Antony actives the time split device
and caused the two to travel to another time.</p>
<p>The Humans on Earth developed an AI system by using alien technology that is sent back in time in order to change events. The
technology sent back was Detective. They studied him and learn how to beat his species, to save themselves. The Humans believed
that Loth'Rak and his son - Antony are behind the attack on Earth which wipes out mankind. People are sent back to change this
- making sure that events take place in order to secure 80,000 humans are taken to Mars to be preserved. Story followed events
to active these humans on Mars and the events following it. Basically it's about man kinds fight for survival over Earth is
destroyed and various conflicts.</p>
<p>Antony tried to talk to Loth'Rak about something but he should shot him down. This made Antony sad.</p>

<p>William Mckee is an artist from Hamilton, New Zealand. His art can be found at <a class="reference external" href="http://artcontrol.me/">http://artcontrol.me/</a> and is available under a
Creative Commons Attribution (BY) licence. William is also a supporter and user of open source software, and is passionate about
early childhood education.</p>
<p>"I use Creative Commons as an artist in the hope that it helps promote my artwork, and to make the world a better place," says William.
"Others may find uses for my art and even make money from it, good on them!"</p>
<p>William seriously became interested in drawing after leaving high school and attending UCOL in Palmerston North.
There he had a drawing tutor, Mark, who inspired him to keep a drawing journal. William gained the habit of carrying a sketchbook wherever
he goes, along with a pencil or pen.</p>
<p>During his time at Palmerston North School of Design, William created the site artcontrol.me: The Art Of William Mckee.
It was hosted with GoDaddy and ran CentOS. The site was powered by WordPress, switching later to Nikola.
He later also switched this to DigitalOcean with the operating system Debian, which is used by the majority of his machines.</p>
<p>While William was always interested in using a Creative Commons licence, he at first chose to use a more restrictive
Attribution-NonCommercial (BY-NC) licence for his artworks, though soon chose to use the liberal Attribution (BY) licence.
William doesn't see many reasons for artists to use NC licences, and finds it especially problematic when NC licensing is used by governments.</p>
<p>As William argues, "Tax payers have already paid for the material. It should therefore be licensed under the most liberal licences
(perhaps even public domain/creativecommons zero). This allows the most freedom for people to do what they like with the content."</p>
<p>William also point out that the "Non-Commercial licences are hard to interpret, as was noted in a German court case in 2014,
which strongly limited the interpretation of NC to 'personal use.' Similar problems with the interpretation of NC could exist
in other countries. This is why I think government - and everyone, in fact - should avoid the NC licence.
I would actually prefer that the NC licence not exist in the first place."</p>
<p>The good thing, Williams says, is that the majority of New Zealand government works released under CC seems to be under CC BY,
though he is concerned that some schools seem to have adopted an NC licence.</p>
<p>In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended The Learning Connexion, where he began to focus on life drawing, using GIMP,
an open source drawing and design tool. William began by painting on a windows desktop and laptop, later switching to
Fedora and Debian. Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait and figures were drawn from references on RedditGetsDrawn.
During this period, William would draw portraits of people and give them the drawing - taking a photo for his own reference.

<p>One key tenet of a liberal democracy, the dominant form of government today,
is the separation of powers into the various independent branches of government,
usually in the form of the legislature that makes the laws,
a judiciary that interprets and applies the law and an executive that carries out
the administration and operations of governing.</p>
<p>Societies in the past were
relatively small and citizens were able to engage face-to-face or via handwritten
messages in their deliberation and decision-making process. As populations grew larger participation in a democracy required mediation,
i.e. communication is now mediated.</p>
<p>The earliest mass media was the newspaper, followed by the radio and television, and today, the Internet.</p>
<p>Because of its emerging function as a watchdog that monitors the running of the nation by exposing excesses and corruption, and holding those in power accountable, the media was regarded as the fourth estate,
supplementing the three branches of government by providing checks and balances. The media also plays a more basic role as a provider of
information necessary for rational debate.</p>

<p>'What could be preping for?,' Vanessa
wondered. She watches as Antony hands
Detective a device. Then the footage stops.
'Damn it', Vanessa curses.
Something happens that causes all the
eletronic devices in the area to stop
working. What they have created is a kill
switch, even if they don't relize it.
Vanessa stood up from her chair.
The camera footage from now is useless.
She needs to find out what that substance was
and how it brought Detective back to life.</p>
<p>Detective agreed to the tasks that Antony
had shown him on the paper. He didn't
agree with them - they involved either
killing or hurting innocent people - people
that had no idea about their effect or
generations after them effect on society.
Steering at the list of names, dates and
times, and event almost brought him to
tears. He had to hold back his emotions.
If Antony had any idea that he was fully
consisious then he would be destoried.</p>
<p>Vanessa had finished researching on the
substance that Antony injected into
Detectives brain - bringing him back to life.
She stood in his surgery room. This was a
hidden room in the palact that had a bunch
of terminal computers and a table for
performing surgerys. There was suspession
of something like this - but this was
horrific. Humans had been going missing and
Vanessa had just worked out what was
happening - Antony was capturing them and
performing surgery on them. He was using the
computers along with the traditinal medical
aplications. Vanessa had found evidence that
Antony was spicing DNA - mixing alien and
human genes together to create monsters like
himself.</p>
<p>6b345 and Blitz had been assisting Antony in
the lab. 6b345 had been riped to pieces when
they spaceship blew up entering the Earth
atmosphere. Bliz had died in the accident.
Vanessa had set the explosives on their ship
to explode when it entered the Earths
atmosphere. She hadn't expected it to blow
up over the building that she was attempting
to smuggle Joey out of - leading to a quick
escape.  It happened though.</p>
<p>AI Robot originally created to make art and
a cat mixed with Antonys human and alien
genes. The strangest of lab assistences.</p>
<p>On the wall was a framed painting of
Loth'Rak. Vanessa could reconise him. Antony
looked very similar to him. Antony had more
human features though. Loth'Rak was a
full alien, well Antony was only half.</p>
<p>Have they been talking about Vanessa, Antony,
and Detective too much with the focus taken
away from some other major events.</p>
<p>What happened to Sarah in the NASA testing
room. They were preping for the Moon blast.
The humans knew it was coming. When Detective
was sent back by Antony for the first time in
order to attempt to save Antony from being
driven out of Mars by Vanessa.</p>
<p>6b345 changes a file that he finds on Mars so
that the robot uprising happens. This begins
when 6b345 finds a red usb on mars. It
contains the system details for the artcontrol
AI system that was developed to create art.</p>
<p>The conference that Vanessa attended on Earth
was the Open Education Resource 2860. It was
organized by robots. They created open
education resources every day that were used
in teaching of the Humans on Mars.
Vanessa shows up and messys everything up
with crashing 6b345 and Blitz into the
building.</p>
<p>Need to write Blitz version of the story.</p>
<p>Blitz was born on 6 August 3555. The dust
on Mars were partickly bad that day. Antony
had created Blitz in the lab. He had mixed
cat, human, and his own human and alien gene
dna systems. It was the same process that
Loth'Rak used on a human and his alien genes.
Antony had memories from his Father and could
access all the skills that Loth'Rak posisted.</p>
<p>Blitz had a speech impediment noticed by
Antony shortley after he created him. The
experiment created an alien like voice box
that became mutated by a virus that
contamanted the system. It lead to a bomb
being set by Vanessa inside of Blirz, leading
to their ship being burnt when entering the
Earths atmosphere.</p>
<p>Blitz strided down the road. She enjoying the
rain. On Mars it never rained but she had
seen photographs and diagrams of how rain
works.</p>
<p>The body of Blitz was cat-like but she had
two human arms coming out of the bottom of
her neck. Along with four cat like legs she
was a highly productive, agile, and super
creature.</p>
<p>The prototypes of Blitz had failed. Antony
had tried to create a mixture of his and a
animals genes for years. Each experiment
being a fail.</p>
<p>6b345 had been a great assist to the creation
of Blitz. Whenever Antony was in the lab he
6b345 was there with him to assist in the
experiments. They went through attempts of
mixing human and Antonys genes but failed.
They were using sick citizens on Mars.</p>
<p>Antony had poisoned the Human race that meant
they were unable to use the time shift device
The files that are on the red USB active the
AI system TechFuncMasters virus. It leads to
the death of all the humans on Earth. Humans
were sent to Mars in order to presurve mankind</p>
<p>This is a story about a series of events that
are attempted to be manipilated by a time
traveler. The effects are grave and
unexpected where multi timelines
cross over.</p>
<p>The story focuses on a red usb that contains
a private key. It follows a series of differnt
and altenative events around this red usb.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the time you spend reading
it. It was created for NaNoWriMo 2015.</p>
<p>It was the second attempt to write a novel
for NanoWriMo. The account has been active
since 2011. Only novels in 2013, 2014, and
2015 were created. In 2014 the novel
SpikeInfoSec was started. The total word count
was only around 7000 words. It was writen on
a raspberry pi computer using a IPython
Notebook in Markdown format.</p>
<p>The injection had lead to sores begin to cover
Detectives skin. Antony watched as his skin
became red and infected. He tried to use
substances to counter the effect but every
day it just got worse.
Detective had been in the coma for 3 years.
3 years of his brain switched off in this time
and active in others. When he traveled he would
of taken the time split device with him,
leading to switch between times as he saw fit.</p>
<p>In 2015 for NaNoWriMo the novel
ItWillNotBeMine was created. With a goal of
1666 words per day. On day one and seven over
2900 words were written. The majority of days
over 1666 words were written. There were
several days when less than 1000 wc, these
were disapointing days but motivation to
increase the count the following days.</p>
<p>The novel was writen on a HP Chromebook
with ChromeOS. It was typed in a Debian
Linux chroot on the Chromebook. It was
also typed on a Raspberry Pi computer with a
tft screen. On both of these devices,
terminal was used with the text editor nano.
For some of the days a Windows 7 computer
was used and software Notepad++.</p>
<p>In the end a novel was created. It was 50,000
words, science fiction, a rough draft. I
published it to the Writers Den Hamilton site
as I wrote it. It's licenced under a Creative
Commons BY 4.0 licence.</p>
<p>Thank you to NaNoWriMo for the event,
Waikato NaNoWriMo, Writers Den Hamilton,
Hamilton Computer Club, Creative Commons New
Zealand and my family and friends for support
and ideas.</p>
<p>The novel is reaching 40,000 words and
decisions need to be made for the final days.</p>
<p>No point worring about the structure. Work on
cleaning up plots and altenative perspectives
on events.</p>
<p>Once the word count is reached the machine
gets to sleep. They have a certain word count
to make a day. How do they measure editing?</p>
<p>The robots just type files and the computer
builds the site and uploads the changes to
the webserver. Billions of words a day are
created. The robots are not told what to write
but instead just choose on what to write by
analizing data. This leads to more happy and
productive robots.</p>
<p>When they were building the robots they relized
that if you made them sad they were less
productive. Telling them what to do was the
main thing that made them sad the data showed.
They fixed this by no longer telling the
robots what to do but instead let them sprint
freely.</p>
<p>Joey loved to sprint. His robot of course
loved it as well. The robot would show up
at the conference enter at 8am sharp, 7
days a week. They would then sprint for the
day - creating mostly Open Education
Resources. They were free to create whatever
they wanted though.</p>
<p>This novel is licenced under a Creative
Commons BY 4.0 licence.
I like this licence as it is free culture.
Many seem to obsessed with putting work under
a NC licence. Take a giant leap and don't
licence under NC.</p>
<p>Can only see people doing great stuff with
anything created. It's exciting see what
people might do.</p>
<p>Need to go through some of the older works
and find events and plots that need a cleanup.</p>
<p>Write down the character and all the events,
times and suitrations that the character is
involved with - from start to finish.</p>
<p>Make it epic and make it now. Let's get this
finished. The last few days should be a good
mofivater to get it finished. I will likely
have a burst to 50,000. Once I hit that I
will be done. I would like to start editing.
Maybe remixing each chapter as a new blog
post.</p>
<p>Taking posts on nzcommons and reusing them
on WrtiersDenHamilton. Remixing them. Great
pratice to edit work. This is going to get
my over the wordcount!</p>
<p>Vanessa had taken a small ship from storage and attempt to locate Antonys ship. From her calcalations she has a rough idea where the ship could be
She was able access GPS days from the ships camera before the footage stopped. Vanessa marched up the ramp. She had decided to bring Joey on the
trip with her. Vanessa was impressed with how much of a hand it was once she actived it. Joey could be a help if she locates Antonys ship.
The ship took off with Vanessa on it leaving Mars atmophere.</p>
<p>Antonys head hurt. The visions of multi time lines were apearing again. He was running low on the substance to opress them. Detecive was still
straped to the chair. His body full of life but his mind in another time. Antony reached for the supply cubbard and pulled out a capsure of the
substance. He needed the injection, the visions were becoming too unbearable. He placed the capsure into a clean needled and injected it into his
arm. The visions imedicatly stopped.</p>
<p>Blitz was licking Sarahs blood off the ground on Mars when she was shot in the head by Antony. The causes a glitch in the timelines. When Sarah was
shot in the head it causes Blitz to be warped to another timeline where Joey notices him as he is walking down.</p>
<p>Joey and Sarah walked down the dark and gloomy road. They arms were interlocked. In the distance they could see a shape that looked like a cat. The
two headed closer towards the shape. It was unusal for there to be other lifeforms out in public. As they got closer to the figure they knew something
was wrong. The cat had mutated or something. Out the side of it's next were two long human arms. Sarah vomited. The creature skretched and ran off.
'What the hell has happened here,' Sarah asked Joey, spiting the vomit from her mouth. 'I think that man Dectective is changing the events', Joey
said. 'Uganka was spose to let us and we would use the time split device,' he continued to expain. 'I have no idea what we do now, we may be able
to still active the time split device. Just because we didn't activate it then doesn't mean it won't,' Joey paused to let Sarah finish coughing,
'Are you OK?,' he asked, concerned for the coughing fit that Sarah had gotten herself into. The creature had stopped skretching and ran off into
the dark. Joey moved up to where it was standing, licking something on the ground. He debed his finger into the substance. It was a rich red.
Human blood. 'What would human blood be doing here?' Joey wondered. 'This is most unusal', he thought. Sarah had finished her coughing fit.
'What do we have here', She asked Joey. 'It seems to be human blood,' Joey explained, moving a sample of the blood into a container for analize
back at the lab. 'Human blood!', Sarahs jaw dropped. She bend down and had a close look at the puddle on the ground. 'And this cat creature was
drinking this? Why?', Sarah asked. 'I have no idea but there is something crazy happening here', Joey replied.</p>
<p>Blitz siped the blood that had been left on the floor when Antony shot Sarah. She looked around. Everything had changed. She relized that he was no
longer on Mars. From what it looked like - she was on what looked Earth. Blitz had never been to Earth. She had been created in Antonys lab on Mars.
Antony had shown her images of Earth. Blitz was part human and cat felling a strong connection to Earth. Blitz froze when she saw two figure
approch. Who were these people? she thought.</p>
