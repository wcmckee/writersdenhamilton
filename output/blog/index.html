<p>PepperCarrot. A Novel by William Mckee</p>
<p>She sat at her workbench. Twirling the feather pen in her
hand. A Cat slept peacefully beside her.</p>
<p>The mailman approached the mailbox with caution. Warning:
Witch Property, the box read. He had been watching the
house since these new witches had moved in. Several nights
ago as he was chopping onions he noticed from his window
green smoke drifting out  from the property. He had concerns
for what mischief they were up to.
What was worse is it wasn't just a single witch that had
moved in - it was a group of them. Three adult witches and a
child. He had seen the lot of them leave the house on their
broomsticks. He had thought about approaching the house and
having a peak through the window but he was worried that there
might be traps - or that the witches return and cast a spell
on him.
The girl had been friendly. He had seen her walking down the
road with her ginger cat. He had been mowing his lawns (something
they needed to do) when she walked past his house giving
him a wave and yelling "Hello Neighbour, I'm Pepper".
Pepper had a basket containing mushrooms. She offered some
mushrooms to the man but he refused. She tried to talk to him
further but he rushed back inside like he was afraid of her.
The man stomped up his front door steps, opened the door and headed
inside.
The door slammed behind him.
Peaking out the window he watches as Pepper is steering at the
house. He closes the curt-ins and continues to peak out.
Pepper calls out to her cat which is distracted playing
with a moth, "Come on Carrot, Let's finish our walk".
The two continue to walk down the road.</p>
<p>The house might need some maintenance Pepper thought. She
the mailbox and looked out to her home in the distance.
The garden had grown wild. An ancient oak tree wrapped its
way through the house. Pepper had asked her godmothers
about clearing it. They were shocked and refused explaining
that the oak tree was in fact alive and they wouldn't dare
chop it.</p>
<p>Pepper had been given permission to mow the lawns. Maybe
if she maintained the house the neighbour wouldn't be
frightened of her anymore. She wasn't surprised when she
was told that they didn't own a lawnmower. 'Put your
training to use and use magic', Pepper was told. She spent
the morning looking through books for a spell that would
allow her to cut the grass. She found the perfect recipe.
The ingredients read: rose petals, cardamom, ginger, coriander,
hibiscus, red geranium, and powdered dragons tooth. All were
common herbs - except for the dragons tooth which was rare. Pepper
stepped out the back door and
headed towards the herb garden where the herbs grew. Reaching into
her pocket she pulled out a pair of secetares which she used to
cut the herbs. She hummed to herself as she works. The sky was turning
gray, a storm was coming. The Gods had predicted she was going to
make this spell. The first rain-dropped landed as Pepper finished
picking the herbs and took a step inside.
Pepper had picked the majority of ingredients she needed from the
garden. All she needed was the powdered dragons tooth. It was
in a glass container high in the shelf. Pepper climbed the ladder and
retrieved the glass container that contained the dragons tooth. She had
gone to a great deal to retrieve this - travelling around the world in
search of dragons and attempted to remove their teeth. In the end she
ended setting up a dragon dentist business and was overloaded with
toothache dragons that needed a tooth or two removed. Sadly she then
found out that the powdered dragons tooth didn't come from dragons but from
a plant. The Binomial name for Dragons Tooth was Lotus maritimus. It is part
of the genus Lotus. Pepper had to travel to South England for the plant. She
found it on a field in which cows were grazing. The plant had grown to a
height of 30cm.
The flowers were a pale yellow colour. The leaves in three's, 'clover'-like
but longer and terminating more suddenly at the far end.
Pepper learnt to make sure she knew what she was looking for before setting
out on future trips to retrieve ingredients.</p>
<p>Pepper had planted the dragons teeth that she had removed from the dragons
in order to build an skeleton army. She would order this army to help out with
her duty's around the house. Pepper watered the patch of garden where she had
planted the teeth twice a day but no skeleton had risen.</p>

<p>This is a reflection post on a DevMob 2015 that I attended in Auckland. DevMob is short for Developers Mobile. This was my first
unconference that I attended - there was no official</p>

Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.</div>
<p>the organized by time slots. Time slots were strictly enforced but anyone attending the conference could run a session.
Tickets to the event was 100 or so dollars with a 20% discount for students. Those that volunteered were able to attend for free. The event was a
two day event so I think it was resemble priced. I was able to attend for free as I signed up to volunteer. I wanted to do AV and record talks.
The talks were not recorded due to mostly that the topics that people were discussing could be sensitive and they wouldn't want it uploaded to the
internet. Next year if I attend DevMob again I will look at recording one of the streams - if people are going to be talking about sensitive topics
then they should not have their talk in that stream.
Instead of recording talks like I usually do at Linux/Python Conferences I spent the majority of my volunteer duties washing glasses. This may sound
lame but I quite enjoyed it - plus I got to hang out with some cool people when doing so.
The majority of the sessions I attended were in the Kai room - near the kitchen. This was a mobile developers conference - united all platforms of
mobile - ios, android, windows, html5 and even blackberry (lol). The majority of the talks on day 1 were focused on ios with a call on day 2 for
more android talks. There were a couple of Microsoft employers attending who gave a session on Windows phone.
I attempted to run a session called 'Towards a new website Creative Commons'. Maybe the title was too general because only myself and another volunteer
showed up. I thought Tanya a Creative Commons volunteer would show up but she was too tired. Another volunteer would of showed up to it but she was
stuck on the front desk with regisation. I discussed Creative Commons a little with the other volunteer - he had heard about it via Wikipedia, then
decided to cancel the session. I headed down stairs and sat near the kitchen with my head on the table - resting. I felt quite crap but I got over
it after awhile.
The location of the event was Hoobsenville Point Secondary School - one of the newest schools in the country. It is one of the newest schools in
the country. It was built in 2013 and opened in 2014. I didn't get to explore the whole school (others were using areas of the school during the
weekend also). The areas we were in were large open spaces. There were also smaller break off rooms. It felt like something out of a Valve office.
Rooms had large televisions mounted on wheels and apple tvs attached (meh to the apple tvs, i would do raspberry pi computers if it was up to me).
For DevMob chromecast was also connected to many of the monitors so people could stream android content. The appletv/chrome cast setup worked
excellent and there was little to no technique issues over the two days.
I had my Raspberry Pi with me connected to my small portable screen and Wacom tablet. Many were interested in the setup and I have gotten good at
explaining it. A small room was used as a hackers room where people did more hardware type of stuff. This was really only on the second day. Android
Auto was demoed along with head gear to control computers with your eyes. I setup my Raspberry Pi up in here to give people the chance to have a
play. This was successful and was better than running a proper session.
Overall i really enjoyed DevMob and would do it again next year - perhaps being more involved leading up to it with web and graphics work.</p>

<p>Hello fellow writers,</p>
<p>We had a fruitful meeting last Wednesday. Unfortunately it was the last time our president Shona could join in on the Wednesday meetings, since she's starting a new job in Katikati.</p>
<p>As you can see, I will be taking over the communication part of Shona's, so I will send e-mails to you all (from the writers den-mailadres in the future) and keep the Facebookpage up to date among other things.</p>
<p>However, we still need one or more persons to chair our meetings in the future... Are there any volunteers? I think it is important there's just one person who  just chairs every meeting loosely the way Shona did and who makes after a groupÂ´s discussion the final decision on the topic for next time.</p>
<p>Please think about this for yourself and hopefully we can decide on someone/some persons at the next meeting on Wednesday December 16.</p>
<p>With the upcoming holidays in the back of our mind, the topic for next time is Family Feud. If you feel up to an extra challenge, you could try to write it from the point of view of the opposite sex. So, if you are a man, you can try to write from a womanÂ´s perspective and the other way around. This could be more challenging than it sounds - we had an interesting discussion about it last time...</p>
<p>As always your piece shouldn't exceed 500 words.</p>
<p>Obviously work in progress is welcome too if you need some gentle feedback!</p>
<p>Is there anybody who would like to do a small presentation on a topic of personal interest? Last time Sachi got our creative juices flowing by providing an exercise that needed some out of the box thinking.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jeff gave a brief presentation on how to enter short story and flash fiction competitions and provided us with some helpful writing tips. You can visit the website flash-frontier.com to read some flash fiction and get inspired.</p>
<p>So, I think that's it for now. Last but not least a word of thanks to Shona: we will miss you and the way you managed our Den! Thanks for your initiative and your useful comments. We hope to see you back at the Sunday meetings once they are going to start...! Keep in touch!</p>
<p>Kind regards and keep writing!</p>

<p>I attended The Learning Connexion between July 2010 and December 2012.
My time was spent drawing/painting on-site, and digital painting/3d modeling and coding off-site.
My favorite classes were Dan Wilkinson, Roger Key, Gary Freemantle and Marc Hill, but I loved any class that offered a life model.
I also spent my time at TLC learning to code in Python. The bus trips in the morning from Newtown to Taita consisted of me typing Python code, and returning home. I was running Ubuntu on my systems.
Returning home each night, I would upload the drawings I had produced that day and blog about them. Some nights I reached 2000+ word count. It was mostly self reflection notes about the day and they drawings - talking about all technical aspects of the works - line, tone, areas that could be improved on,
I never did computers on-site but taught myself digital painting (GIMP)and 3d modeling (Blender) at home. I wanted to be a concept artist - but I fit into being a technical artist.</p>
<p>Drawing, digital painting, writing, game development/publishing, Linux sysadmin, av volunteer at tech conferences and coding (still Python) is
my day to day go to.</p>
<p>Linux Debian 8 runs on the majority of machines. Art and games are licensed under a Creative Commons (CC BY 4.0) and code under MIT. I like these licenses as they are the most liberal.</p>
<p>I have several sites that I have built over the years - to host content that I have created.</p>
<p>ArtControl.me: The Art Of William Mckee:</p>
<p>ArtControl has been around since before I started at TLC. It's used to host my artwork. A mixture of traditional and digital artworks. During my time at TLC it was filled with life drawings. I would get home after a long day of life drawing, upload my drawings and discuss them. The site greatly improved my writing skills. Word Counts skyrocketed - reaching over 2000 words in a evening.
Nowadays the site doesn't get uploaded as much but I aim to put some digital paintings up now and then.</p>
<p>BroBeur Studios:</p>
<p>BroBeur Studios is a one man game development and publishing powerhouse. Formed in March 2013 with the goal of taking artwork from artcontrol.me into Video Games. ArtControl had previously done some game development but I wanted an alternative site and identity for the game dev. BroBeur Studios creates games in Unity3d and Python.
BroBeur takes many elements from ArtControl but extends them further with 3d, gamedev, and publishing.
BroBeur also builds software. Lately I have been working on post production video editing. This is done with Python.
One of my latest scripts opens up a random selection of images from a folder - then blends and mixes them together, and saves the results. Other Python programs I have worked on are web scalping (bbc news, various adult sites, and even the TLC sites).
I'm getting it to do a bunch of cool stuff along the way - such as adding black bars to the top and bottom of the screen, text, and buzzy image results. Each time I hit run I have no idea of the results. A surprise each time.
In future I plan on mixing these post production image effects with my video games and work on editing a film/television show.
I use GIT for source control and host everything on Github.
Working on a game for a television show or film is also on the list. I've previously worked on a Dune game that was inspired during reading of the book.
Game Of Thrones and The Hobbit/LOTR are other IPs that I have explored in Game Design.
Games are cross platform - focusing on web, Linux and Android.
Some say my games are not games but more of an art experience. I like to think of them as cinematic adventure games. Largely influenced by game development companies such as
such as Telltale (The Walking Dead), Blizzard, Double Fine, and Lucas Arts.
I want to make games that feel and play like television shows and movies.
A shift has been made away from game development and into software and operating system development. It's an area I'd like to get back into -
especially with the discovery of the game engine Godot. Godot is similar to Unity3d but is crossplatform.</p>

<p>This weekend it will volunteer at nzdevmob2015. It's being held in Auckland. Volunteering was the only option. Of course specifically - audio and
video. They called it in early to help setup with displays. It plans to be in a room where there are regular speakers. A room where it is focused on
quality talks - with slides. It has no idea about the video and audio setup they have. Perhaps in the morning check the internet for previous
conference videos. Even if it comes down to it - records audio on iphone. Hopefully place has decent mics and a camera.</p>
<p>This is the first time that it has attended this conference. It's a barcamp. un-conference. Create the sessions yourself. Given rooms, timeslots,
freedom to do what you like.</p>
<p>Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand - Ideas for a new website. How to find volunteers and allow them to micromanage. Champion volunteers within
volunteers. One of the great things about this conference is the people attending get to run the sessions. I would love to see one that explores
volunteers in small organizations and how they can scale and micromanage. Matt replied to my comment on a new ccanz site. I've suggested to move
away from php/wordpress and towards either a python powered framework or a static site - maybe a combo of both. See how this weekend plays out but
I'll be interested in a session to discuss and brainstorm ccanz site.</p>
<p>I'm going to be staying at Kirsty and Eriks on Thursday and Friday. It's my birthday on Friday. I've been asked to help setup at nzdevmob2015. I'm
looking forward to seeing the setup that they have. It should be quite good - they have been doing this for enough years. They are using Slack
for coms. It's the first time that I will use Slack but it seems very simple. It's like IRC but you have the option to pay for it, as well as it
seems more simple. I'm looking forward to all the free swag. It's been sometime since I've been to a Microsoft sponsored conference - global
game jam would of been the last one - and that was a game jam. Before that it might have been Hack Auckland - which was years ago now.
Other sponsors include TradeMe,</p>
<p>Last month I wrote a novel. It was called It Will Not Be Mine and was in the Science Fiction genre. The total wordcount was at 53,050 words. Each
section of the book is split into daily writing sections. There is no chapters or structure - just what I felt like writing that day. I've certainly
kept to a theme and worked on creating a story. I started to edit the novel towards the end of November. The 28th was the final day I wrote anything
of substance. On the 29th and 30th of November I wrote: 'hello' and 'world'. When editing I started with day1. It had a high word count for the first
day and allot of summery type writing, along with the ideas that others at NaNoWriMo meet up in Waikato had given me.</p>
<p>The meet ups in November in Hamilton were on every Wednesday morning. I got along to several of these. Sadly it was a bad time - 10am in the morning
so the majority of people were at school or work. I think if you are going to have meet ups during the week it's best to have them at a bar, bookstore,
or library. In Wellington they had weekly NaNoWriMo Wednesday meet ups at a bar. I didn't get a chance to attend one of these but talking to those
in Wellington they sounded popular.
Waikato also had a meet up on Saturdays. This was hosted by Lisa at her workplace. This was for only 2 hours. Like during the week not many people
showed up which was a disappointment. On each of the days of this event we only had three people in total in the weekends. The first weekend was
popular - 9 or so people. They found this in Wellington also - lots at the launch party but they drop off quickly.</p>
<p>After writing for a whole month everyday i felt a bit empty and unknown what to do with myself. I had gained a habit of writing the novel everyday.
It was basically my life for a whole month. There was not much else that I did or was interested in. From when I woke up in the morning till getting
a boost on that days word count before I fell asleep.</p>
<p>I stopped editing the novel. I'm not even going to look at it till Jan 2016. Once Jan hits I'd like to edit it. There are plenty of spelling and
grammar errors that need fixed. It's currently a rough draft. Much of the novel I haven't even read.</p>

<p>currently sitting at chch airport after spending the
weekend here for kiwiPyCon.
My experience started when I showed up at Catalyst IT on
Thursday and volunteered for AV.</p>
<p>Brian was running the AV who I had previously worked with
at LCA2015. The setup for AV was much the same as at LCA.</p>
<p>Four of us were trained (or in my case - refereshed) for
AV. Toby (who primary did still photography), Jen (who
worked in track one on the camera), and Zane (who worked
with me in track 2). I had originally signed up to work on
track one but shifted around on the Saturday morning.</p>
<p>On the Friday I arrived at 8:30am and setup to record
the keynote. I was going to film it but Ryan suggested
that it would be a good idea to let someone who hadn't
filmed before have a go - so I let Jen on the camera.
I was switched to track two.</p>
<p>I arrived on time on Saturday to watch the keynote by
Katie Bell. I left partway thorough the keynote to setup
video in track two.</p>
<p>Recording of the first talk began after morning tea.
DVswitch was the software for recording - the ability to
live edit - switching between the camera and laptop with
keys 2 and 3 allows the videos to be uploaded to the
internet with minimal editing.</p>
<p>The day was smooth with minimal problems. The most major
problem was at the beginning of a talk I was unable to
switch to the slides. The frame would just freeze on the
camera. I kept it on the camera and contacted Ryan.
DVswitch had to be reset and some settings changed to get
the laptop feed working.</p>
<p>By the final session on Saturday I was tired and needed a
break. Zane took over the camera - he needed a break from
the sound. I stayed for a bit to make sure Zane was fine
with camera duties, then headed outside for some fresh
air.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning I slept in and awoke at 8am. I knew I
was going to miss some of the keynote but wasn't worried
as I wasn't filming it. I txted Ryan to let hime know that
I would be late and will arrive partway through the
keynote.</p>
<p>I took turns with Zane on the Sunday switching between
camera and sound. I also had the opitionity to mic
presenters which I hadn't done before.</p>
<p>There were less talks on the Sunday than Saturday so
wasn't so worn out.</p>
<p>After the conference finished I walked from the university
to Hornby. It wasn't as bad walk as I was expecting,
taking an hour.</p>
<p>What am I inspired to work on after attending KiwiPyCon?</p>
<p>One of the most inspiring talks for me was a lightning
talk given by a girl catrin who talked about CodeClub,
and Ministry Of Education.  I talked to her after the
lightning talks at afternoon tea.</p>

<p>The first KiwiPyCon I attended was back in 2013. The
location was the AUT campus in Centeral Auckland
This year it is in Christchurch. I have been typing
python code since 2011 so it took me 'several years
to discover the conference. In 2013 I was living in
Levin and took the night bus from Levin to Auckland
on Friday night. I arrived at KiwiPyCon early on
Saturday morning. I had paid for a student/unwaged
ticket. I didn't attend the dinner on Saturday
night. I had my dell laptop with me and can remember
typing python code with IPython Notebook. I didn't
attend KiwiPyCon last year in Wellington. Bit silly
of me really - but I did watch the talks on YouTube.
This year I applied for finacial assistence and they
were very generious - my ticket was paid for along
with $100.00 towards my travel. I am going to be
staying at a friends of a friends place in chch.
It's a caravan so unlikely to be anything special.
I'm not worried though - as long as I have a roof
over my head and a shower I will be fine. The
caravan is located at a park where there are showers
and such.</p>
<p>This year is the first year that the conference is 3
full days. In the past its been just the Saturday
and Sunday. Though I believe in the past they have
had tuturials on the friday.</p>
<p>I've taken a look at the talks. I need to decide on what
track to go to - 1 or 2.
Things I'll mostly be interested in hearing about:
Web Development. API, static blogs, design.
robotics. Raspberry Pi.
Education.</p>
<p>I am less interested in database and cloud related topics.
Things like Openstack.</p>
<p>I am planning to work on Nikola on the Friday. In the
afternoon there are  beginner tuturials, and sprints.</p>
<p>There was a call on the mailing list for people to give a
interest of any topics to sprint on.
There was mention of pip,
and my Nikola.
The creator of Nikola Roberia even expressed interest to
me on Twitter that he may be advable for hours/day if it
goes ahead.
I'd like to see it happen. I will be working on it and
encourage others to join me.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what types of people I would get. Some
may be experts with static blogs. Others may never of
heard of them.
I'll be willing to help people in getting started with
Nikola, but the best thing to do is read the site and
use it before the spring.</p>
<p>Ideas for spring - Excel doc.
Lists all issues.</p>
<p>In November there is the NaNoWrite. Write 50,000
word novel. 2014 was the first year I attempted this.
I'd like to write a self biologey. Or maybe a autobiography
on someone.
My best friend Peter could be interesting to write 50,000
words about.
It might be better to take his character and write it
into a fiction character</p>
<p>Currently sitting in Auckland airport. I have my boarding
pass and just waiting to board. It's an overcast day, but
it's not raining suprisinly.
When I first arrived I had a panic attack and went through
the security without getting my boarding pass. As soon as
I was through security I relized my mistake and went back
to collect my boarding pass.</p>
<p>Currently I am on flight to christchurch. The
takeoff was smooth and I have an excellent window
view of New Zealand. Just experienced a little
turtalence but it was minor. The flight is only
going to take an hour. We are above the clouds and
looking down all I can see is ocean and some
coastline. I was sitting at the wrong gate - I
thought it was gate 30, but
but turns out it was gate 21. I noticed when someone else
was asking about Jetstar and they were redirected.
I quickly packed my Pi up and headed to the correct gate.
I was one of the last thoough the gate but I wasn't late.
There is no free food or drink on this flight.
I have a bottle of water and two sandwhichs. They are in my
bag though which is in the overhead lockers. Once I land
in Chch I will put on warm clothes, eat my food.
I then need
The food and drink service has just closed - we have
almost arrived in chch.</p>
<p>In Python related news the third and final keynote has
been announced - Alison ? who works for Dropbox.
This means that there is three female keynote speakers
at KiwiPyCon. This has to be a first.
It's great there is such a large number but I do hope they
are not keyspeakers just because they are female.</p>
<p>Katie comes from a education background so the talk will
likely not be very techniqaual. Lets hope it's not wishy
washly.</p>
<p>Once they announce trays up I'm going to switch off the pi
and pack it into my laptop bag.</p>
<p>The flight is almost over. It was a smooth flight but my
stomach is a bit sore.</p>
<p>The mountains have snow on them. It is very mountionous.
This has to be the south island.</p>
<p>Sadly I left my camera at home. I guess it's one thing
I won't lose.</p>
<p>The plane is almost completely full - I'm at the back row
(30) and there is no one in the five seats beside me. '</p>
<p>Time to shutdown. Till we arrive.</p>
<p>testing the pi!</p>

items. First was</p>
