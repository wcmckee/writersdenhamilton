    <p>so i have registered for wikieducator. It offers free elearning resources. I am enjoying editing and adding content. Areas that I was interested in
adding resources were tech, digital citizenship, art. Conferences and Events. I came accross a course from Otago Politechnic on Tourism and Travel.
I felt I could contrubite to the resources on conferences. It's always safe to add links. I included a few links - to AV recording talk and to
lanyrd - the site that lists confererces and events. I added some education resources on AV setups at conferences and expanded the section on goodie
bags.</p>

    <p>Pepper sat on the couch and weeped. She had never been so upset.
Torn in her feelings, she could not decide. The book had taken
her
several months to finish. She had almost reached the end and couldn't
face the idea of the book ending. She had grown attached to the
characters and wanted more stories from them. The writer of the book
had created a realist world of the time, although it was a work of
fiction. Some say it is not a novel, but a poem.</p>

<p>A Quiet Revolution was taking place across the world. It changed the way humans dealt with one-another. Some may say that is a work of fiction. Events like this do not take place.</p>
<p>Copyright is control. That is all it is. It's about saying who can use material and what they can use it for but Pepper liked the idea of giving back. Money made was invested back. Moral. Why are writers often pro copyright? They sob and cry over fair use law changes.</p>
<p>Peppers plot</p>
<p>Historic fiction of generations over several 100 years. Follows copyright battles.</p>
<p>9/11 was a attack on open source.</p>
<p>Characters are transported in</p>
<p>Write every day and give away your work for free and open. Others may make money from it. It can be changed.</p>
<p>Whenever Pepper saw someone wearing a Metallica shirt she would shout, 'Napster, never forgive, never forget'. Majority of the time they had no idea but once anger erupted and Pepper was attacked, knocking her to the ground.
The man in the Metallica shirt stood over Pepper, repeatably kicking her. Blood gashed from the body of the girl.
"This is for ripping off the best  band in the world", the man screamed as he grasped her neck and lifted her up. "No longer will  you spread your lies", he spoke, twisting her neck. Letting go, the limp body dropped to the ground. The Metallica fan walked away with a smile.</p>
<p>The capering agency building. Lets create some open writing exercises.</p>
<p>At the entrance a sign read: "Some days I can't get outraged over copyright". Artwork of a stick figure sitting under a tree. The foylar was open and bright. The walls were  covered with artwork similar to the entrance - from artists that had openly licensed their work.</p>
<p>A crowd had gathered and approached. They ignored her standing. She could hear  the conversation they were having.
"There was no explanation as to why allowing people to legally quote, or noncommercial redistribute for educational or review purposes would destabilize the publishing industry,"</p>
<p>Pepper was told she wasn't a creative professional but a content builder. She would take others work that  was openly licensed and build upon it. It's building upon something creative</p>
<p>The aftermath of the Metallica file-sharing debate, leading to a total change in tune on file-sharing.</p>
<p>There was no collapse in local publishing after parallel importing restrictions were lifted.</p>
<p>What would be the aftermath of fair use?</p>
<p>Creative Commons: A Quiet</p>
<p>"This is a real 21st-century textbook," Pepper addressed the crowd. She paused steering the individuals in the eyes. "I hesitate to even use that word,"  that word - that harnesses the power of the web to break out of the print model we've had for the last several hundred years. It's Open Access, which means a lot of different things: it's free; anyone can read it, use it, adapt it; it's also open to wider scrutiny, which helps improve it over time." Richard White.</p>
<p>"quiet revolution taking place in the way we use, generate and transfer knowledge"</p>
<p>"look at these cool projects"</p>
<p>"why aren't these cool projects happening everywhere"</p>

<p>Hi and Welcome to day three of camp. This is  usually the last day of a weekend conference. Friday. Saturday. Sunday. Isn't that wonderful. Currently Pepper is sitting out the back of her home drinking a tall glass of cider. It is refreshing on a day like this. She is slightly behind on her word count today. This morning she woke early and had breakfast and fed the cat (but not the dog). She got ready for the day and went for a walk. It was a beautiful day and she was going to be leaving the next day so she wanted to make the most of the weather. Her walk was not as long as usual. She returned home and drank cider. For the rest of the day she plans to increase the word count so that she hits the 50,000 words she had planned this morning. Once she has reached a certain word count then she will be rewarded. The biggest problem is the head. It's just far to hot outside and inside will likely be almost worse. Could put the air condition on insights just far too hot in here.</p>
<p>The old man sat on his chair and read the newspaper. Even at his age he was still able to create content and publish. Every since he could remember the drew or wrote everyday. He always thought he was bad at subjects but really it was just the teachers. Able to do anything really. Did a range of projects in his lifetime. Run a art blog where he would publish recent art he had created. This was usually drawings, paintings, and sometimes 3d, street art. Portraits, life drawing, landscapes, city scapes, characters, creatures are just some of the content that is created in the artwork. Content on the site is licensed under a creative commons attribution licence. This is a free licence. The content can be used for any purpose, just give credit. Going to need to get a few word counts today if it is going to hit 1667 words, which is what is needed. Again my biggest excuse for not writing today is the heat. Hard to think when too warm. Easier to get out of the heat than cold. Warm during the day means warm at night also. This is good for people that are living on the street at night and for those that want to be out late. Helps foster a more active night life because people will be out and about at night as it is too hot during the day. If its cold quite easy to warm yourself up. Go for a run. Light fire. Put on more clothes. Warming  a home can be harder but is possible. The old man wanted some lunch so he put down his paper and stood  up. He cooked two corn cobs. Quarter there and3 quarters to go. Meet nice people at holiday parks. Pepper stayed at holiday park once and meet Prince. She was in love. Pepper knew if she could marry into the bloodline of royalty the chaosah school of magic will conquer all. It will strike down on houses like Magmah and Aqahq. What sort of lame names are they for the houses? They should of just changed them themselves without fighting about it. Many people died when the schools of magic went to war. Pepper sat on her chair and ate bad unhealthy food. It made her feel awful but she did it anyway. Her day had been bad. Soon she got up and made herself some veges. They were very yummy. For dinner that night she had a lamb strew. It was delicious. It was full of meat, carrot, potato, onion, pumpkin, water. It needed to cook for 7 hours then it would be ready to eat. Always good to get the strew on early and wait it for it cook before turning it off and letting it sit. Creates a more tastier stew. It is super warm tonight. Today is the greatest day I've every known. Can't live for tomorrow. Tomorrow is much too long. I will burn my eyes out before. Pepper once got told off in art class for painting herself when the reliever teacher told them to paint themselves - portraits etc. That reliever was no fun. What is Peppers top 100 songs for broom riding. Red light shone off her hair and head. Blue from her white dress. Her long legs stretched out as she. Her high heels bringing her closer to heaven. She switched to a yellow dress. The light didn't reflect so much.  For lunch  Pepper had . corn. It was OK but nothing special. Looking forward to dinner tonight itshouldbe good. Sweat poured from Peppers forehead as she typed. Today has been very motivational. Once Pepper had taken her medicine she was able to type. Her head was full of stories and ideas. Thinks she needed to get down on the paper.Hello? Can you hear me? My nigger, my nigger. It would be cool to read a novel by good movie directors. Maybe find a David Lynch book? I want a work of fiction though, not nonfiction. Typing from the very bottom sucks. Sometimes I just want  a clear button. Keeps the text being written on the top half of the screen. Why not just move the window up? That works and there is not much power left so going to get as much writing done as possible. I feel today hasn't been much about Pepper and Carrot. Maybe the remaining words could be more focused on Pepper and Carrot. It was mid after noon and the day was beginning to cool off. The room wasn't so hot to sit in now.The televise is off. Huge distraction. The old man is reading his kindle. He likes it very much as the text can be made large. New notebook every day for a month. Quick script to do something. Its hard to say I'm going to build this. There are ideas that are built around. Need to self-publish a book. But first need to get a book edited to publish. ebook format and licensed under cc-by. A  science fiction novel. Edit together best things from nanowrimo14/15 and camp16. There must be something decent in that to be edited together and published. Just keep writing books and edit later. As long as no words are lost. Yay above the 1000 mark. That's over halfway for Today's goal. Was planning on exporting off gimp drawings to png. Need a script that gets the gimp files and creates png whenever new line layer is created. Basically new layer also equals new layer. Sometimes she goes into a panic. Something is wrong but doesn't know what. Something goes wrong and its worse less  than what planned. Pepper stood in front of the crowd.  They were packed into the hall, eager to hear what Pepper would announce. Many of the townspeople wanted to go to war and there would be pressure  on Pepper for military action. This is something Pepper wants to avoid. Before her there was a great war between two houses. Magmah and Aquah. These schools of magic attacked each other and drove one another to the blink of extension. Billion of souls were killed in the war, billions wounded. Everyone on the planet was affected by the attacks. Even with Pepper in command as a True Witch  of Chaoash forces were bring destruction to the world. Sitting on the bench the little boy looked up at the witch standing above from him. She had black hair that went  to her shoulders. On top of her head she wore a witches hat. Her robe was long and a dark purple. Her skin was pale white. Not allowed to talk about the novel until the word count is done. If someone asks you what your writing is about say no comment and write until you hit the cap. It's easy to get around this. Wake up early and write those 1667 words. Easy to do before anyone else is awake. Do it everyday at the same time. This novel is being written completely with a raspberry pi 2b. The novel in November was written to begin with on a android tablet then a chrome book. Sometimes it was written using a pi2b and a smaller touch screen. Having the larger screen is an advantage but is more annoying to carry. They only called you when they missed them. The column that has been reached on this line is amazing. Can go an edit later. Will likely go through this and split up the lines as it is out of control currently. Most important that word count is reached. How close do you think I am so far? We are going to load as many words from the servers as possible and announce to the world on how it is going. testing word sprint. The theme is carrot. You have 10 minutes. Then ten minutes later the sprint stops. Everyone announces the word count that  was reached.  What has been changed now is Gedit is taking up 3/4 of the. Going to use this as a test. Need it to check to see how much words increased. As well as printing word count, print change from previous file. Announces sprints and themes for writing. Going to test to see if I can do this for five minutes and not stop. there is no reason to hit there enter key all you really need to do is sit here and type. Writing a novel is a good way to get your typing skills increased. Too often people don't use their fingers good enough but one you start typing and stop looking at the file. Word is outdated and moved away from the desktop processing move. This is especially bad for schools and not a good idea to teach students how to use and ignoring how to make. I think that's that great think about orbs. Is building upon them. They made say it needs to be cleaned up and fixed but who knows. After 10 minutes of steeping it should auto save  Not going to leave it to chance as the battery pack is running extremely low. 5%. Certainly using Bluetooth is consuming a large amount of the battery. Could use wired keyboard, especially small and keys light up. Often  type on keyboard when dark. Use battery pack to give light to kindle. I want a kindle that has a build in light feature. Replaced the battery pack on the pi for a new one. It does have 100% charge but that's OK. This Will last a few hours and help get my word count close to 3000. Why not aim high. It's easy to sit here and type for sometime. The old man is watching his  rugby. His eyes fixed on the screen. There is no way he is moving until half time. at half time he may get up and do something. What he does is up to him but it will likely be something. They going to look for abstraction. If it hold up the witch will lose. That's a try the people on the television announce..The sport does not interest Pepper. She just wants to type her novel. Lets see what it is getting to today. A little drop of summer. If Pepper is eve. How come the text keeps getting highlighted with blue? IT is annoying. Pepper ate the cookie that had just cooled after being baked in the oven. There was nothing Pepper liked more than a gooey chocolate chip biscuit. Planning on hitting 9000 words no problem..The past two days have made  3000 words. The cat sat on its green sleeping bag. The old man believed the cat was smelly and washed the sleeping bag along with giving the at arose down. The cat didn't mind being hosed. It quite liked water. Need to get another thousand or so wands. That around  3 pages or something. Bang it reached 2000. Isn't that wonderful. Could call it quits for the writing today. What would I do for the evening? Writes a python script? Paint? Draw? Eat dinner. Dum de dum. After Pepper had her dinner she was feeling fall and satasified. She had reached her wordcount for the day so decided to word on it a bit more before heading off and reading in bed before sleeping. The old man has gone off and slept. Leaving Pepper along in the lounge. Carrot would be outside hunting. The dog had gone with the old man. blah blah blah going to make some more words on this file. Pepper worked on her script to help with the wordcount. It has a nicefeature now that allows to check for  how much  of a wordcount increase happened. This file is saved every minutes so I should be able to tab accross in a few minutes and it would tell me how increased it is. I like to build software is make writing a ok more interesting. wow sometimes the typing is just horrible. Beforebed Pepper wanted ashowed. Other idea is to sleep and wake up early and have a shower.Need a shower tomorrow as I didnt have one today. I guess the autosave doesnt work.Thats annoying. I guess I can time sprint but. Sprints run at 5 past the hour. The first sprint is 10 minutes. That lasts until 15 past the hour. there is then a 5 min rest period before the next sprint. The next spr is a longer 15 minutes sprint that lasts untill. The probgram doesnt seem to be working to report back the changes. Oh well lets see if this helps. The auto save is working but the ncrease in words announcment is not working. Not really sure whats wrong with it. Need to go to bed soon and sleep. Going to need to pack my grear and have a shower when I wake. Ok I think the increase script is working. Good job Pepper. She is a winner and made it work. This is super cool script and aI cant wait to play with it further. What more features need to be added. Auto update nanowrimo wordcount on the site with data from files. It is still a crazy heat. Where Pepper was living was one of the hottest temp in the country. What was worses the old man had hidden the remote for the air con. He was very worried about code and would rather not use the air conditional. Maybe get down to South Island Pepper might do a talk down there n a few months on some of the witch stuff she has been learninOnce there was a l ittle girl named Pepper. She was traiing wwith her Godmothers to become a True Witch of Choeah. I cant belive how people can reach 50,000 words in just 24 hours. It's something that would take lots of prae. Writing a novel is a bit like updating twitter. You just need to put down the imprant bits and make it sound interesting and believable. Get carried ahead of myself and introduce too many chancters. She is only a w hundrad words off reaching theh 3000 mark for the vening. Wasn't going to force self to hit that much but if I dont have anything else to do. Might as well go brush teeth and go have meds before coming back and typing here on the pi gain. I think todays writing has been rubbish. Would like to wake early tomorrow and get a burst of writing done before the travel. Music for the travel. Might be on bus with freewifi. Unlikely. Likely a nakedbus rar than a manabus. WHenere she started to type all she could think about was the damn weather. it was crazy hot and there was nothing she could do about it. Outside was cool. Lets go outside she said. Her car Pepper had came back inside by now. Too much of this novel  far has been me complaining about stuff and not focusing on typing the pepper and carrot novel that was planned. Sweat went down his for hea. It was not pleasing. Tweet increase in writing. What time of day is the most amount of words written? Does the deather or location make a difference. Blah blah blah this is going to be a winner  isnt it. Once there lived a girl named Pepper. She lived with her Godmothers in Squrrls End. Pepper hadn't always lived here. Before becoming a orphan Pepper had parents. They were both killed in the war between Aquah and Mahmah - along with many other people nd the rest ofPeppers familton. Not sure how well this word count script works. It''s saying that the word has increased but the increase is saying zero. Very strange. Interisting. got the script to print out minutes. jueed to to retrieve tweets. Sadly the keyboard is running low on batery. Need to keep it off when now typing. Also need to type hard on it will it turns off. Wish I could plug in recharagable aaa baterries. When I was younger had bateries that I could recharge. These were helpful and wish I had kept better care of them. The chargers that  Ihave for the pi are great but would like ones that pport 2.5 power rather than 2. The new Pi is quite powerful. Not only does it have built in wifi and bluetooth that will work out of the bo on any debian install. This program is really good at keeping track of my speed. Reaching about 40 words per minutes. Turn it into a game. Need to save up archiee of words. Web app that allows to browse and compare other peoples wordcounts. Battle is off word count - keep track of how many words are typed every minuutes. The damn increase isnt showing up. Isnt this terrible. Im a bloody winner. My name is Pepper. Standing in front of the broken mirror her dark hair blew in the gently wind. In her hand she clutched a broomstick. A potion containing a orange liquid was in her other hand. Climbing on the broom was Peppers cat - Carrot. He was a bright ginger playful cat. Goingg to check to see how close getting to new record of words. This line is amazingly large. I don't link I've written something and not formatted it. Oh no thats not true. The formatting that takes place is awful. Pepper stoodn front of the crowd and did her peach with her slides assisting her to the side. Not sure if this is going to work or not. Because it keeps lagging behind. Maybe it shouldnt save backup. Maybe do word count for 5ins auto save. This makes more sence for the 110/20 min. Needs to sync with nanowrimosprints. Make sure its on the god damn right time. Write something in a functional language to output batch processing and rendering. God damn script that opens a gimp file that is being worked on and saves off every layer that ist being woked on. Able to leave notes to paintings and works that will be added to the image once it is published as a blog. Man tatery in this keyboard is getting low and its going to go flat. I guess I should just turn the keyboard off and go to sleep. I ant to git this first.</p>

<p>Today is the second day in writing a novel in April. It's the first time I
have given it a go in this month - previously I have only written a novel in
November.</p>
<p>Pepper fed Carrot his cat biscuits. He as very hungry that morning. He
hadn't been fed since the previous morning. Pepper had put Carrot on a diet
as she was told that he was getting fat. Carrot was not impressed by this as
he thinks he is a skinny cat. He does not like it when people think he is
fat. Carrot is a long pussy cat. Stretching out over the carpet. His front
two legs are way out in front of his head. The back legs are stretched back.</p>
<p>Damn a few scratches on the pi tft is annoying. Makes it not look so cool.
What can you do about it though? Buy a new monitor? Not worth it yet. I would
rather just use it scratched for now. Might buy a new one in the future with
How did it get the scratches in the screen anyway? Monitor banging against
the wacom pad and keyboard. From falling over onto stuff. General wear and
tear. Need to work on this script for keeping track of word count and files.
Would like more backup things as part of it. Read online that it was not
possible to auto save in nano. Are there alternatives to nano that is simple and
allow auto save?</p>
<p>Alright I have switched text editors. No longer am I using nano but instead I am using gedit. It has an auto-save built in and word wrapping. The text is a little smaller than the terminal but it works. This is fine. I can tab every 15 minutes of writing and check what my word count is up to. Maybe display word count inside geddit. Anyway got to get going with the word count today.</p>
<p>Pepper was excited to win the potions contest. The money she won from it would go towards her training as a witch. She was told by her Godmothers that she was to be the next True Witch of Chaosah. She was the last of her bloodline for this left. It was important for her Godmothers that Pepper take the training seriously and not joke around. There is nothing more than Pepper likes more than joking around and having a good time. She does still take her studies seriously though. Carrot slept beside Pepper as she held the feather pen and drew. Cumin was prancing around the room, looking busy. She had told Pepper that they would continue potions training today, that the holidays were over. Pepper had a great holiday. She had a sleepover at one
of the witches she met at the potions contest and they had played board games late into the night. The witch lived in a giant old castle. It was flash compared to Peppers home. But Pepper liked her place and would not want to live anywhere else.</p>
<p>Cumin realised that there was no Dragons Teeth left and asked Cayenne and Thyme if they would go and get some. They declines as it was late in the day. The two witches were happy
around the fireplace. Thyme painted her toenails and had no intention of leaving anytime soon.</p>
<p>It doesn't take long to get a decent amount written. This editor is fine. It's very minimal but has a few more settings than nano that is needed - especially auto save. I have word wrap turned on also so when I reach the end of the screen it moves down to the next line. This is helpful as it means I do not have to hit enter so much. The only thing I might improve is the colour theme. I would like a blue background and dark red text. Similar to my painting. Though with painting a blue background hasn't been used for sometime - it's been plain white.</p>
<p>Komora City. Market day. The streets of Komona were busy with sellers and buyers. Amongst them were a figure that wore a light coloured witches hat with a dark band going around the hat. Attached to her back was a broom. Her dark hair poked out the back of the hat. She wore a dark purple coat.</p>
<p>"Good morning Sir, I would like eight pumpkinstars, please", Pepper asked the shop keeper. The animal had a bald head with very circular ears and a red earring. His nose and mouth was shaped like a muzzle of a dogs. He must have been a mixture of animal and human as his hands were human-like.
"Here you are, that's 60Ko", the shopkeeper handed the pumpkinstars to Pepper.</p>
<p>"...Oh dear", Pepper spoke. She emptied the coins from her purse. There was certainly less than 60Ko.
"Uhh sorry, I'll have to take only four..." Pepper apologised to the shop keeper. He looked her angrily and removed two of the Pumpkinstar from the bag.</p>
<p>Just as they completed their exchange a voice could be heard beside Pepper, "Greeting, good Sir. Please prepare two dozen of everything for me. .Premium quality, as usual. It was a blonde witch. She wore a purple hat and matching outfit. In her hand she held a stack of coins - enough to buyout the shop.
"It's always a pleasure to serve you, Miss Saffron" the shopkeeper greeted her. His mood had switched an an angry mood with the sale with Pepper to a happy mood as he knew Saffron was always a big spender.
Saffron noticed Pepper. "Hey look, it's Pepper" she remarked. Pepper didn't say anything just looked at Saffron annoyed. "Oh. let me guess business is booming in the countryside?", Saffron asked sarcastically.
"I guess your preparing the ingredients for tomorrow's potion challenge", Saffron asked. Pepper finally
spoke. "A potions challenge? Tomorrow?. Pepper left she had enough of Saffron and her bad attitude.
Pepper had found the letter about the potions challenge. It read: Komona Potion Challenge 50,000ko grand prize FOR THE BEST POTION On Azarday, 3 Pinkmoon Grand Plaza of Komona.
Pepper was excited. "Lucky me, I still have a full day to prepare! Let's win this challenge", she yelled in confidence from her broomstick.</p>
<p>When she arrived home Carrot was there to greet her. He waved, happy that Pepper was home. Pepper studied through a stack of books for ideas for the potion. "Oh! I know", she clicked her finger and a smile rose on her face. "That's exactly what I need!", Carrot opened one of his eyes. He had been trying to sleep when Pepper was reading but now she had woken him with her chatter. Carrot knew what was coming next. "CARROT!", Peppers voice boomed. "Get ready, we'll hunt the ingredients together". Carrot knew he wouldn't be able to sleep anymore. He had to wake and go with Pepper. It would be fine once they started.</p>
<p>Once loaded on Peppers broomstick the two were ready to leave. Carrot held a large net. the two had rope tired around their waste. The sky was dark but lightning lit up the sky. Heavy black clouds filled the night sky. "First, I need a few pearls of mist from those black clouds", Pepper told Carrot. He knew know what the net was for. It was going to be Carrots job to capture the pearls from the clouds. Tough work.</p>
<p>Next the two had to go he the haunted jungle for red berries. This was not fun for Carrot who got tangled in a spiders web and was attacked by spiders. The next area to visit was for egg shells from the Phoenix valley of the volcanoes. The heat here was too much for Carrot and he sweated.</p>
<p>The next ingredient was a drop of milk from a young DragonCow. This giant flying beast had wings and a body like a dragon but a light colour and dark spots and facial features of that of a cow.</p>
<p>Back home the evening was growing late. The sky was a purple and pink colour and the clouds a bright orange. The sun was setting. It gave Peppers home a gloomy purple look. Inside the home Pepper was busy prepping the potion that she had just gathered the ingredients for. Pepper sat down and tested the potion she made. "mmm. Best. Coffee. Ever", she spoke. Taking another sip of the hot drink she had made. Carrot couldn't take it anymore. All afternoon they had been out to collect ingredients for Peppers potion and it as all for just a coffee. Carrot fell over tired and slept. Pepper was happy with her coffee. "It's everything I'll need to work all night long and make the best potion for tomorrow's challenge".</p>
<p>Pepper spent the night putting together the potion. Finally she came up with the Genius Potion. A potion that makes anyone super smart that consumes it. Pepper got Carrot to test it. It didn't work so Pepper threw it out the window. A group of any came into contact with the potion, causing them to learn advance maths. In the end Pepper ended up falling asleep.</p>
<p>She awoke in the morning in her bed being flown (by her broom)
to the city of komona. Carrot had prepared fresh clothes and her witches hat. Pepper fell asleep before making another potion. Carrot had prepared a potion for Pepper. It was Carrots urine from a recent vet visit. Pepper was annoyed. she knew she would not win with the potion. What would she do? There were three other
witches entering the competition. Including Saffron who she had met at the Komona markets. The other two witches seemed friendlier. The fair skinned girl was quiet and shy.</p>
<p>wow this is almost the word count for today done. 1667 is the word count daily goal for November. But it is cooler to just say 1666. Number of the
devil/Satan. Devout holy novel. litrate. Pepper and Saffron fight over love of the Prince. Both want to marry him. Basically hit my word count for today. Would like to get more done today. It's almost 1100. Beautiful blue sky with white clouds. Slight breeze. Might wear jacket. Take pi and walk. Draw. Sit and do drawing studies of things.</p>
<p>Welcome to Writers Den Hamilton.</p>
<p>An opportunity for writers to develop skills, confidence, and network. Sharing and supporting of others.</p>
<p>Fortnightly at the Hamilton Central Library, Kathleen Glenn room.</p>
<p>5:30pm to 7:30pm.</p>
<p>Pepper sat outside her favourite cafe, eating a camera slice and drinking a hot chocolate. Her witch's hat was perched on the back of a chair. Peppers dark hair blew in the wind. A small child walked past. Eyes were fixed on Pepper. The gentle nature of children.</p>
<p>Whats the next web comic that am i going to write about. I see there were several new posts added to the fan art section of the pepper and carrot site. There was one drawing by a New Zealander which was neat. zomg this is not going to work testing one two. Going to check what the word count will be running at today. Today will be the third cafe that I have been to in 3days. All different. At each one I ordered a hot chocolate and a cameral slice. They were all delicious.</p>
<p>Death thought it was ironic that he was sitting at Heavens Bakery. It was true that Death didn't choose sides. He served both the  heavens and hells. He felt more attached to Hell. Following Death where ever he went was Hades. The souls that Death removed from the Earths were tossed into Hades then processed to either heaven or hell.</p>
<p>The blue sky was still visable but much of it had  been covered with clouds. Dark gray clouds were forming in the centre. Walking here there was several drops of water. But nothing to worry about much. Wondering to stay here for awhile more then walk home or walk into the city. If I walk into the city I'm worried it's going to rain but if I stay here don't get out as much. There is always tomorrow. That will be the final day to get out. Been busy in the past few days by getting out. Important as don't come here often. This place is nice and it's just good to get away to somewhere you usually don't come. Once there was a secrets.</p>
<p>Pepper can type very fast on her keyboard and doesn't even need to look at any of the keys. How many keys per minutes are you typing. I think they mean characters per minutes. How quick to reach 50,000 words do I need to type? Average out five thousand words every two days. It would take ten days to reach 50,000 words if 5,000 words were typed every.</p>
<p>The Council of Ah made several magic houses sign a peace treaty. Both Aquah and Magmah after much debate signed the treaty. This brought peace to the world of Hevena. The majority of magic houses were neutral but it had been hard for several of houses. Great shortages of food and health supplies had lead some of the houses to lend aid. Peacekeepers were also sent into hot areas.</p>
<p>Today was the first day of Peppers witch school training. For the next 6 years she would live in his home and learn under the direction of Chaosah witches.</p>
<p>It was my birthday and I invited the witches that I competed against at the Potions Contest. Sadly none of them showed up and I was forced to summon demons into Hevena which had the party with me. There were three demons that I summoned. Two which looked similar, one green and hairy. The other was purple and had bigger muscles. Those two demons were both male. The final and third demon was a female spider-like demon. They were friendly demons and enjoyed the party. It was very lowkey. They had cake and tea. The spider demon was a fan of drinking tea - she drank over 20 cups during the evening. She was a friendly spider demon and Pepper had a great time chatting to her.</p>
<p>The Bank of Hevena is teaming together to bring you a service and API to help with writing your novels this month. Everyone here will be writing 50,000 words. If you fail you will die. It will be painful. There is no reason why you can can't write. It's just words on a page. The words can be basic and full of mistakes. The important thing is to sit down everyday and write some words. Set a minimal target of words per day. Writing software and apis to help with wordcount. Keeps tracks of the hours and clients. Auto billing. For version control it uses Git. Does commit every 100 or so words. Spell check before commit.</p>
<p>Find most common words in file. Then finds gifs based off the words. Nginx is able to serve billions of requests
per second. Serving only static files. html, css, markdown, rst, txt, png file types. Sites are powered by Nikola a static site generator. Content is licensed under a Creative Commons Attubutation 4.0 International licence unless specified otherwise. Copyright and the evils. Journal subscriptions - access to knowledge - becomes "fiscally unsustainable" to the richest university on the planet.</p>
<p>Pepper is an art student. She found some artwork online that she wants to download, print out, and use in her art project. She isn't sure who created the artwork or what that artist might think of her using their work. Does she take a copy? Or look for something else? It can be hard to know. Artists and creators have a problem. Copyright law is getting in the way of realising the potential of the internet in creating and promoting their work.
"Why is this" spoke Pepper. "What digital copyright culture should we work towards to best support the arts?".
The Witch took a drink of water before continuing, "Copyright is a form of intellectual property that is granted by law automatically upon creation of a work. It prevents people other than the creator from kaing copies of (inc luding adapting, sharing or performing) that work without the creator's express permission. It is unregistered - unlike patents or trademarks, you don't have to apply for it. Don't need to use the copyright symbol. Copyright lasts for life of the creator plus fifty years, copyright then expires and the work enters the public domains". Pepper spoke clearly. Switching through the slides as she talked. Once she started talking she was no l77longer nervous.</p>
<p>"I choose because I like that Attribution-ShareAlike licence gives others the freedom to be able to use my work in any way they wish to, but only if they then allow others to use that work in the same way. By including the ShareAlike restriction in the licence, if someone wishes to use my work commercially then they must open up their own work. This is a positive.</p>
<p>Pepper lay on her couch with her orb computer sitting on a table in front of her. Using a Bluetooth keyboard she typed the novel. Carrot lay on her legs. He wanted loves from Pepper but she shooed him away, wanting to focus on her novel. She has never edited any of the novels she had written in the past. The first time she entering the writing contest was November 2014. Pepper wrote a science fiction story. It was never long enough to be called a novel, but it was a start. The story followed several characters and places they work and the advancement on automatics matters such as food creation and delivery. In 2015 Pepper was a winner of the contest. She managed to write just over 50,000 words during that month. The room was boiling and was hard for Pepper to focus on her writing. She had made her goal for the dat but had written enough and she had. It had been a record few days for her. It is about learning when you have done enough and giving it a rest for the day. It is too hot though trying to think about getting up and going outside. Need to check how much of the battery is left. It is likely not huge. Of course there is a script to run every 60 seconds that prints the information about the file. The script checks to see the most recent edited file in the writersdenhamilton posts folder. This is where Pepper writes her novels. They are saved in here and shared. Pepper allows people to share, remix and adapt her novels. They are licensed under the very free CC BY. Isn't this wonderful for everyone! When writing the novel Pepper was able to get inspiration from a range of sources - public domain and creative common licensed works. This script could be used by anyone who write files. If care about looking at most recent file changed, the word count, and the most recent word. Had confided getting top 5 words and looking for gifs on them. ignore boring 1 or 2 letter words. Filter the top words. Novel generation. How much of that writing can be taken changed and remixed, and then added back to the novel. When does it get repetitive? Does it make for a decent book? Does it even make it faster. Need to save and check words count. It must be getting high now! Very good. The word count is even more today than yesterday. Need to build some software in April to do with writing. Make graphs out of word count data and content data. In all the novels/short stories what is the most common words that are longer than 2?  That is the question and we need an answer. I am very happy with the setup. Need something to protect the pi and the screen. concerned that its getting damaged when I transport. Would like easy way to put it in bag. Wrap it in protective plastic? I'm not sure but whatever you do, fix it before the screen cracks more. It's a expensive screen and you need to take care of it. Getting tired and should stop this and go and read. Need to perform the git stuff before I get off it. Can keep the pi running all night since it is plugged into the wall. Usually only run it  from the battery pack and have to keep them rotating over. Pi3 is sitting at another place. Looking forward to getting it back.</p>

<p>Dear Saffron,</p>
<p>Thank you for the letter. It's been too long so splendid to hear from you.
You certainly have been keeping yourself
busy these past few months. Will you show me
some of this new magic? The stuff that is created from the orbs.
Carrot is good, but always very hungry. I think he is missing your cat. Those
two would play together like best buds.</p>
<p>What more to tell you. Cumin has been teaching me potions. Last week she got
me to get 'Dragons  Teeth'. I thought she meant REAL dragon teeth but she
meant the plant. Have you used the plant in any potions? Anyway I have quite
a few dragons teeth here that I don't know what do with. Do you have any idea?</p>
<p>In one of my training I had to scare a human. Everything was going fine till
I entered the room they were sleeping in. omg, you would not believe it.
The most cutest, handsome prince. Our lips were about to touch when BANG he
turned into Thyme. Dammmmnnnnn</p>
<p>I went on holiday to a island. It was very chill. just lay on the beach with
Carrot and siped juice. Man there was this giant fish that swollowed the two
of us up. We were stuck in this fishes stomach. Carrot came up with a good
idea and scratched the fishes insides with his long, sharp claws. This caused
the fish to vomit us up. Not the most fun day lol.</p>
<p>The other night me and Carrot followed Thyme going to that cave again. She
was  using that glowing orb. After she left me and Carrot turned it on. I
won't tell you what displayed but it was embrassing lol. I figured it out and
switched it to a endless runner unicorn game. You remember the one you showed
me. The game crashed or something. It must of trigged an alarm or something
because the next minute a giant spider was there to help getting the orb
fixed. He showed us where their server room is. Super cool, next time you
are here I will take you and show you the setup.</p>
<p>How have your classes been going? Cayenne is teaching me spells. I don't
think shes doing a very good job at it. Maybe if</p>
<p>Anyway looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>love,</p>
<p>Pepper (and Carrot x)</p>
<p>Dear Pepper,</p>
<p>Thank you for the return letter. I have been busy with my witch training so
slow to reply. I will teach you some of the magic I have been learning.  It's
mostly stuff to do with earth elements. Quite  different to the demon summoning
that you are mostly into.</p>
<p>I've heard it's posible to bury dragons teeth and sketeton warriors would
rise from the grave. Sounds like something that the people over at Zombiah
would be interested in. Have you talked to them about uses for the dragons
teeth.</p>
<p>That's funny about the cave. What was it that Thyme was looking at? I once
caught one of the workers at the orphanage looking at something they shouldn't
of. blah blah blah goes the letter. Those spiders sound cool. I'm looking
forward to meeting them. Were they affected by the genius potion like the

<p>What makes Saffron evil? She is a manapiftic person that uses others for her
own gain. Thinks little of others. Cruel nature. Like Pepper Saffron is also
an orphan.</p>
<p>How did Pepper and Saffron become orphans.</p>
<p>Only witch in the group that has parents is Zombiah. She is spoied by her
father the king. City currently ruled by him but will be pasted to the girl.
After awile they thought nothing of it. People were fighting and killing to
become king. There once was a witch that lived in a shoe. There was an old
lady that lived in a shoe. That's how its going.</p>
<p>I have a new assignment I thought you might to give it a go also. As part of
digital citizenship paper that I have. It's really fun. Basically you about
copyright and the law. They teach you this stuff called Creative Commmons.
I like to think about it as a hack on copyright. What Creative Commons offers
is licences that copyright owners can apply to their work that gives permission
in advance for use of the material. All rights reserved. Some rights
reserved. No rights reserved. Public domain work falls under the no rights
reserved. If something is in the public domain then it's free game to do what
you want with the material.
It's good and well to learn about creative commons but really you need to
apply it. Find a work that is licenced under creative commons or public
domain and share, remix, adapt into something new. Be brave and licence
the something new under a free licence. Once in a while there tests a person.
That this script is working correctly. Everything they do is monitored.
Every keystroke on their devices. Spoken words are analized and compared to
criminal databases. The sirens don't shut up they just keep blasting and blasting.
It's a civil emergeny and the sirens have been blasting for hours. There was
an attack on the city by Aquah. They unleashed their most heavy forces. The
cities walls did not hold. Magmah archers attacked from a distance. Swordmen
attacked enemy forces breaking through, or climbing up the wall. Enemy had
ladders that they used to climb the walls.</p>
<p>Do you ever wonder what it was like to fight in the war? All those souls
that were lost. They never really discovered what started it. But it was
something between Aquah and Magmah houses. Do you have any ideas?</p>
<p>So what do you think of my digital citizenship project? For it I have decided
to write a novel. It's based off the web comic Pepper and Carrot. Merge in
public domain and other creative commons stuff. Write stories out of Jems
comics.</p>
<p>I entered this potion contest there were 3 other witches that entered the
contest. The first made a dead bird come alive. She was from the Zombiah
school so typical spell. The next was a girl called Saffron. She made the
undead bird posh. It had a fancy hairdo and handbag. Ah was too frightened
to use her potion but Saffron snatched it from the girl and tossed it on
the undead posh bird. This potion caused the bird to become huge. It was out
of control. Lucky I saw able to scare the bird off with my potion.</p>
<p>Once I have gotten the last of todays word count done I can go and have fun.
I will reward myself. The sun sat to the east. The sound of yelling and screaming
was fading. It had been a day of killing. Tomorrow will be a day of mourning.
Too many souls were killed today on the battlefield. They will be missed by
their wives, mothers, fathers, siblings and children. A roar of thunder could
be heard through the plains. The dark night sky flashed with lightning.
Rain hailed upon the heads of the men. The woman far away in their homeland.
This was the year 1805 and follows the Russians as they faught in wars.
Red coats vs blue coats.  Red is Russia. Blue is France. Prince is captured
by enemy and exchanged for a deal. The deal that the exchance happened is
in lock up and only a few select have seen the deal. It was said to be a peace
treaty between the two houses but the details were never revealed. The council
were accused of withholding important information by not revealing the deatils
of the deal. Spys have been sent to break in to the information and release
the information. The info can't be harmful now as it is outdated and any
information on it. It is said someone within the agency leaked the details
then escaped the company. They didn't hide the fact that they released the
details, but they didn't want to be the face of it. There was public outcry
over the release of the details. From both sides. Those who supported the
witch in releasing the detail - it's for the public good. Transparency of
public agencies. against - harmful to troops. Allowed to spy and watch
everything people do.</p>
<p>She siped her bottle of Isaac's Cider Original, typing the beginning of her
novel. It was a young adults novel and the word count goal was 50,000.
Challange to do stuff hasn't done alot in past with novel - first person.
Follow the story though the eyes of a fourteen year old witch in training
called Pepper and her ginger cat - Carrot. Sitting there Carrot purred. He
was a happy pussy cat. For the first day wrote letter from Pepper to Saffron
and a return letter from Saffron. It was really just a warmup and I'm not
sure what to make of anything. I guess just don't worry and look for new
content to include. Get better of not saving and checking wordcount so much
just spending more time only writing. It's getting dark and cold out there.
Soon it will be time to go inside.</p>

<p>Pepper went and attempted to get Dragons Teeth from a range of dragons -
fire, air, swamp. This was a fail and instead opened up a service of removing
dragons teeth for free. This lead to her having a large stock of dragons teeth
due to not needed dragons teeth to begin with. Pepper had gotten it mixed up.
It was the plant dragons tooth that Cumin needed not real dragons teeth.
Pepper had written to several of her friends and asked them what to do with
all these dragons teeth. It was fill of lots of chit-chat but the dragons
teeth questions were most important. Pepper had recieved word that one of the
best things to do war burry them in her garden and skeleton warriors would
rise. She thought this was a great idea by Saffron so did just that. She
found the dragons teeth that were most healthy looking and buried it in her
garden amongst all her vegetables and herbs. Pepper belived you should only
grow what has a use. Food was good to grow as she could make delicious
breakfast, lunch, and dinners out of the food produced. Currently the garden
caters for %100 of the kitchens needs. Pepper needs not visit the market.
She is slective on foods she grows and seeks expert witch advice on the
matter. If you don't do something right. Do it again. The black bird flew
in the sky. The bright blue background behind it. The bird moved in and out of
the Gray clouds. It knew there was going to be a storm still and it needed to
get home to it's family. It was too late and the family of the bird perished
in the storm. The bird was sad and didn't know what to do. One day it was
flying past the majors office in Komana when it dropped to the ground, dead.
It had suffered a heart attack. The major found the dead bird and decided
to use it in the contest the very next day. The bird is still alive -
the giant undead-posh bird. Very much alive. Pepper chased it away from Kormano
but it was quite happy to leave and found a new home. It was able to settle
down with a family. It lived a very jolly life. The tree branches bent in the
wind. Maybe Pepper needs to go and sleep soon I think she has done enough word
for tonight. This is a good start for tomorrow. What will happy tomorrow? This
is very much of a pantster project. Sure its being based off the pepper and
carrot web comic. Ideas have been developing. Before this file there are
another 12 based on Pepper Carrot stuff. They are unedited, first drafts for
a novel. When it finally comes to editing the three novels together there
needs to be a wealth of content to draw from. Of course there is going to be
three novels. There has to be three. Not going to focus on the magic heavly.
more litery than fantasy.
The spiders were really interesting. One of them wore glasses. They sat at the
end of his nose. His face looking at the orb in front of him. It was flashing
brightly. 1. 2. 3. Drink.</p>
<p>I have drawn you a picture that I drew recently when I was on holiday. I had
my Portable Pi Digital Artist Wordstation. Complete with the offical
touch screen from Pi Foundation, Wacom drawing tablet and pen, and a Raspberry
Pi 2b computer. All this was being powered by the cased battery pack. The Pi,
monitor and drawing tablet were attached to the right arm. There was a place
to secure the pen also. Was able to draw by holding the pen with left arm and
draw with the Wacom tablet, able to see what is being created on the touch
screen. Art created is moved to a folder where a blog post is generated.
Reflect on the artwork. Give updates to how drawing is going. For example
switching from a3 to a4 and reducing brush size 20px to 10px. Switch to larger
16 gig SD card. Need to format current sd card. Plug in new 16gig sd card and
pi3. Need to find a screwdriver that would do this for. When I save it need
to keep typing for another minute or so. After which how the hell can someone
get 50,000 words in the first day. You must start at midnight and just go all
night. Stopping only for food and toilet. No sleep and before the clock
stricks midnight hit 50,000 words. How many words is that per minute? Get a
generater to generate a book with social trends. Twitter trends are prompts.
Likely lots about american politics and war. Anyway I wouldn't mind some
prompts. They could be helpful to get me through some of the slower days. Today
certainly isn't one of those days!
It's hard to know when to stop really. It's very peaceful out here to get
stuff done.  Currently only Carrot is here distracting me. I'm sitting on my
chair typing on the keyboard. He jumps up on the table and walks around the
table - very carefully. Each paw touchs the  same spot as he strives around
in a cirle like a model walking out on stage. catwalk.  Getting tired and cold
out here and want to go read War and Peace. It is a long read. Currently 30%
through the book. Enjoying it. Nice mix of romance and action. Well thoughtout
and exacuted. This is not going to add more points to your score but it will
help by the time you get to the next day. Still push yourself and get that
goal done quickly. How quick this time can you hit 50,000. Last time you did
it finished with several days free to write more and nothing on two days. Was
sick of writing. Have been writing quite a bit in March - warmup. Will hit
goal then might get sick of it. See how it goes. The incests are biting my
angles. It hurts and is annoying. This makes me want to go inside. I don't
even know what the time is and have no way of finding out unless I go inside.
Need to go toilet. The lemon trees need it.
The light shone behind the armchair. The old man sat in the chair His eyes
fixed on the television. A game of rugby was being streamed to his monitor.
It was 24 hours of unique spots matches. All live. Able to time switch if
it if you want. It was almost half time and the old man would have supper
during the break. In his younger days this was a beer and a bucket of potatoes.
The Irish was rich in his blood. Never meet the old-old man. Stories told about
him and like to tell stories about him. Write a novel about irish coming to
new zealand.  Fleeing the church. 'Work' trip to nz. No money so shovel fuel
for trip. Also has to clean and cook. Has workers/staff dorm. Food and
bunked bed room.
Pepper ordred a home that she could put together herself. The majority of it
was printed with her 3d printer. They are cheap and it's common for homes
to have multiply 3d printers. The old man sat with his glass of juice and
chewing his choclate chip cookies. They had just been cooled from freshly
baked in the oven. The choclate chips were large and gooey. His dog was
stretched down in front of him. The fireplace had die out but the warm heat
still kept the room cosey.
wow and pepper didn't even copy anything from a novel today. Fun doing sketches
of same buildings as i did few years ago. Back then had sketchbook wide and
clutch pencil. Sat in same seats as last time. This time have pi. Problems
with eyes. Feel the need to close one and things arnt clear. For closeup
take glasses off and read. The text is more clear with my glasses off. Can
read the smallest type from a distance. Would like to read from a greater
distance naturally without glasses. Will my vision ever be perfect for distance?
The old man missed the 2nd half of the sport. He got himself distracted in
the kitchen. What was he making at this hour. The scores had changed in the
sports match and the team that was losing is now ahead. This made the old
man grumple. The dog had moved now. It was lying on the couch.
"Cats and Dogs can sleep on grass but what they really want is a couch", said
the old man.
"love me, love me, say that you love me", the music playing out of the
televion. The music was playing on everyones cellphone. zombie rugby player.</p>

animating purposes. Kielbasha is part of daily life on Hereva. Do good by

<p>The houses were all painted with with orange roofs. A stone wall protected
the city. The entrance was steps leading up to a large stone pillar.
The stake of the great tree weaved below the stone walls. The stalks had grown
thick and tough. People had built houses on the stalks. The city had grown
to over population and extension helped. Markets and shops considered
expanding their presence into these areas. They only traded above
the city.</p>
<p>There was a floating island that houses only the cities riches residents.
Their houses are large. There are no shops but they have chefs and cooks
on hand for meals - plus servants they can send to the markets for more
food. Many didn't need to leave their home. They were happy living amongst
the clouds. Above those living on the floating korama city.</p>
<p>It is unknown the event that started the war between Magmah and Aquah but
Hereva was changed because of it. Both schools enlisted aid from any
other schools.  The schools were dragged into years of conflict.
The house Hippiah attempted  to stay neutral but the starvation and famine
was so great they supplied Magmah with food. Chaosah was at the height of
their powers. They played both schools against each other. At the height of
the war Zombiah used their magic to animate and re-animate both mechanical
constructs and fallen warriors.</p>
<p>The High Council of Ah remained silent for the majority of the war. Once
Zombiah began-animating fallen warriors Ah took notice. Once Ah become
involved with the conflict the fighting ceased. Remaining remember from the
magic schools were assembled and a treaty was brokered. The results of
what are stored in a magic lock-box visible only to select member's of the
schools. The treaty brought an end to thee fighting and bloodshed that had
long plagued Hereva.</p>
<p>The High Council of Ah come to the decision that both Magmah and Aquah were
to blame for the conflict. The punishment was the houses suffer the ultimate
shame of being renamed by the other school. Magmah renamed Aquah as
Warrgarblah. Aquah renamed Magmah as Kielbasah.</p>
<p>After the treaty was  signed Zombiah focused on animating constructs and
creating stronger materials. It is unknown if Ah was responsible for Zombiah
change in focus, or if it became uneconomical to re-animate the dead.</p>
<p>Pepper and Carrot live in a  house overlooking  the  forest near the village
of Squirrels End. The house is fused with together  with trees of the forest
with conventional building  materials.  It is unclear if the  house  is
magically entwined with  a tree or if the tree  grew  around the house.
Perhaps both  as  the tree continues to grow around  the house.  Outside the
house  is   a mailbox with the number  '33'  and  the sign 'WARNING  - WITCHES
PROPERTY'. Countless  traps  are set thorough the forest.  The  traps are
effective and  have kept the dangers from the  forest and idly curious from
discovering the house.</p>
<p>Little is known who lives in the Witches house but other Witches tutor Pepper
at the house, to bring her up as a 'True Witch of Chaosah'.</p>
<p>Flora and fauna around Pepper's house tends to exhibit strange behaviours. The
ants near the home ere able to under advance maths as the result of a
potion tossed from Pepper's home. It is believed they took this math and
applied it. One of the outcomes were the orb computer</p>
<p>War and Peace. Leo Tolstoy.</p>
<p>After Pepper had driven off with her son to visit Saffron, the Witch sat for
a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. The Witch, with
her daughter and a large number of guests, was already seated in the drawing
room. The count took  the gentlemen into his study and him showed them his
choice collection of orb computers. From time to time he went out to ask:
"Hasn't she come yet?" They were expecting Cumin ,  a witch distinguished not
for wealth or rank, but for common sense  and frank plainness of  speech.
Cumin was known to all magic schools, and both cities wondered at her,
laughed privately at her rudeness, and told good stories about her, while
none the less all without exception respected and feared.</p>
<p>At the men's end of the table the talk grew more and more animated. The
wizards told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in
Squirrel's End and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day been
forwarded by courier to the commander-in-chef.</p>
<p>The Wizard was a stout, tall, plethoric, kormona. evidently devoted to the
service and patriotically Squirrel's End. He spoke with a   Kormona
accent "blah blah blah" he spoke this last word with particular emphasis on if
it lay the gist of the matter.</p>
<p>They burst out laughing, and all the guests joined in. Everyone laughed, not
at Cumin's answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this
little girl who had dared to treat Cumin in this fashion.</p>
<p>Pepper only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice.
Before the ices champagne as served round. The band again struck up, the
witch and wizard kissed, and the guests, leaving their seats, where up to
"congratulate" the witch, and reached across the table to clink glasses
with the  wizard, with the children, and with one another. Again the footmen
rushed about, chairs scraped. and in the same order in which they had entered
but with redder faces. the guests returned to the drawing room and to the
wizard's study.</p>
<p>Pepper sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it seemed
ready to lift its  tail, jump down  on its soft paws, and begin playing with
the ball of wirsted as a kitten should.</p>
<p>He had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready
to dance in the large hall, and the sound of feet and the coughing of the
musicians were heard from the gallery.</p>
<p>A Jazz band was playing that night. All the cool kids would be there. Pepper,
Saffron, Cumin and others. It was the kind of event someone wouldn't dream of
missing. But people missed the event. The unlucky ones. Those that did
attend the band that evening had a wonderful time.
The band were  completely improvise. They just played their instruments together.
It was completely instrumental  and there were no vocals. The crowd were happy
with the music. Several couple were swinging together on the dance floor.</p>
<p>To Pepper, I cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. you command
only my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my
order. You are causing me to  lose the fruits  of a campaign. Break the
armistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him that the general
who signed the capitulation had no right to do so, and that no one
but the Emperor had that right. If, however, the Emperor ratifies that
convention, I will ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the
army... You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.
The Emperor's aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are nothing when they have
no powers this one had none... The Austrians let themselves be tricked at
the crossing of the bridge, you are letting yourself be tricked by an
aide-de-camp of the Empire.</p>
<p>Soldiers scattered over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were  building shelters with merry
chatter andlaughhter; around the fires sat others, dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg bands or mending boots or overcoats and crowding
round the boilers  and porridge cookers.</p>
<p>The wizard was sitting in the drawing-room where Cumin had engaged him, as
a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in which
several others
joined but which bored the wizard. When the music began  Pepper came in and
walking straight up to the wizard, laughing and blushing:</p>
<p>At this a sudden change evidently took place in the witches' ideas; her thin
lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice  when she
began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself evidently did

<p>Pepper had been browsing free ebooks on the Amazon store. She had downloaded
a bunch  of public domain books. One of these was War and Peace by Leo
Tolstory. Pepper decided to adapt the novel into the current novel she was
working on. There is a war that takes place between the houses in the
pepper&amp;carrot web comic story. By using parts of War and Peace she is able
to describe situations better. It also serves as an excellent learning
resource. How much of the text needs to be changed? Sometimes it's just
character names, sometimes there are no changes. Experimenting with writing
techniques such as letter writing. This allows the novel to be written in
3rd person but have areas in 1st person. Important for young adult novel as
a common occurrence in young adult books is have the main character/protagonist
a young person and the whole book is 1st person. For a challenge write a young
adult book in first person. Maybe through the eyes of character in Pepper and
Carrot. Prompts for CampNaNoWriMo. Follow the twitter stream of sprints.
Continue rewrite of public domain and creative commons works. Whatever happens
set daily word counts. 2000 is a nice number. In November it was common to
easily reach over 2000 words. Why not make it a minimum word count?
Today had been a hard day for Pepper to reach her word count. Recently she
had been able to reach 2000 words easily. Today was a challenge.</p>
