<p>Sarah heard the jug boiling from behind the door. She had just showered, rinsing the blood from her body. Antony had given her some clothes
that belonged to his ex-wife. Antony's wife had been in a terrible accident and passed away. Antony had never remarried but instead focused on
his work. Shortly after his wife's death he was hired to develop software to develop code for to get the computer to paint lines. Antony was
a specialist in writing code for graphics. Antony never meet the man who contracted him. All the code was uploaded to a server. He was given
a private key to connect to. When the code was uploaded to the server it is moved off the server and original content deleted.</p>
<p>Antony opened the pantry cabinet. He was hungry but wasn't quite sure what to make. Noodles seemed like a good choice.</p>
<p>Sarah opened the steel door and steeped into the room. Antony was standing in front of the cubard. He seemed to be deciding on something
to cook. 'Take a seat', he spoke. 'Thank you', Sarah replied, moving towards the table and chairs. 'You must be starving, is there anything
in particle you feel like?', asked Antony. 'Yes I am hungry, whatever is fine', Sarah replied. 'Fried noodles it is then', Antony reached
for the Japanese style noodles. 'Cut two onion', he spoke. A metal mechanical arm with a knife attached to the end on the bench started to
cut up two onions. 'auto fried noodles'. 'fried noodles started', replied the machine. Antony moved towards the table where Sarah was sitting.
'I will let the machine take care of dinner so we can talk', Antony remarked as he took a seat opposite Sarah. 'I will like you to explain
all events you can remember from the past twenty four hours', Antony asked Sarah. He took out a pad and pen.
'Where to begin', Sarah replied.</p>
<p>Sarah looked back at the Earth from the capsule. She was being sent to the moon on a mission to recover prototype 6b345 ArtControl. System
control had lost contact with it during a recent mission. It had been with 5 other prototype ArtControl machines exploring craters of the moon
before its radio-signal failed. It was suspected that its system had been taken over by a hacker and it was being remotely controlled by someone
on Earth. This was dangerous as this particle machine was designed with nuclear capabilities.
Sarah closes her eyes as she exited the Earth atmosphere. The ship she was traveling over was running the AI ArtControl system headless. This
allowed for ArtControl to control the ships functions so that the crew were able to relax. This cut down the risk of mistakes as ArtControl
was designed to not make a mistake.
Once on the moon Sarah would carry a Raspberry Pi computer hooked to her life support that would assist her on the mission to retrieve prototype
6b345. The Pi was running the AI Artcontrol.
Sarah stepped out of the pod. The her suit had been modified to allow her to walk on the moon with similar gravity to that of Earth.
20 meters in front of her she spotted the moon buggy. This was going to be used to get to the crater where system control last had contact
with 6b345. The buggy was equipped with GPS that would be controlled by ArtControl to take her to the crater.
She started moving towards the buggy. 'Sarah, this is system control', came a voice on her headset. 'confirm, This is Sarah', she replied.
'We notice you have arrived and exited the pod, status update' the voice asked. 'Everything is fine, moving toward the transport'.
'Roger that, ArtControl will take over once you reach the transport, system control out'. The transmission ended.
Sarah continued moving towards the transport. After finally reaching the transport she climbed into the seat. It was a single pod that had
been designed to move over the toughest conditions - perfect for the rocky texture of the moon.
Sarah reached for the Raspberry Pi from her belt and connected it to the transport.
The Pi switched on with the power given to it from the transport. The monitor in front of Sarah switched on. Bios loaded, and the kernel
booted. Once the operating system was loaded the transport began moving forward. Sarah strapped herself in as it began to speed up.</p>
<p>In a distance the prototype 6b345 ArtControl watched the transport zip across the moons surface. 6b345 stood still, knowing the humans
would not be able to find it.</p>
<p>3km till destination the monitor display. Estimated time of arrive: 45 seconds. Sarah could see the crater now that they gotten closer.
The transport started to slow down. It stopped just before reaching the crater. Destination reached the monitor displayed. Sarah unbuckled
her belt and climbed out of the transport. She moved into the crater. The place was a mess. Scraps of metal were lying around. She reached for
the camera in her belt and started to document the evidence. Something had happened her and it was her job to figure it out.
She moved deeper into the crater. What is this metal? She thought to herself, it was nothing like they had on Earth. It must of been some
sort of alien technology. Sarah bent over and gathered some of the metal depree into a evidence bag. Scientists back on Earth will analyze
this. It may shred some light on what happened to 6b345.</p>
<p>6b345 watched as the human gathered evidence from the site. It had activated its camo that rendered it invisible to the human eye.
It watched as the human placed an object into a bag. 'Sarah, this is system control', a voice blasted. 'We are getting some crazy
radio signals from your position, status update please'. The human lifted her arm towards her ear. 'Sarah', 6b345 thought to itself.
It loaded its database of human personal. 'Sarah Clarkson, 27 years old, American', The database showed. 'More detail', 6b345 loaded
more detailed information. 'Born New York December 15th 2021 at 5:32am to Danny and Mary Clarkson. Attended New York State School from
ages 5 till 17, studied computer science in New York University for 4 years. Currently working for NASA as a AI developer.'
6b345 shutdown the report.</p>
<p>A sharp bass notice blasted in Sarah ear. 'System Control, was that you', asked Sarah over her mic. 'Sarah, This is mission control.
We did not transmit, is there a problem?', replied system control. 'hmm strange, it was a bass sound happening in my headset', Sarah
remarked. "I'm done here, heading back to the pod". Sarah turned around and headed towards the transport. She needed to head back to
the pod and return to Earth with the evidence she had gathered. She reached the transport that would return her to the pod.
The process was the same as before - she took the Raspberry Pi from her belt and attached it to the transport. The monitor booted up
and transport turned around - heading towards the pods location.</p>
<p>6b345 held on to the transport as it started to move towards the pod. They were planning on traveling on the ship with Sarah. The camo
was running out of power though so it may need to hide in the pod during the return trip to Earth. This could cause issues if Sarah noticed
him on board. There was enough power to get on the pod and take off, which is the important.</p>
<p>Sarah pulled up at the pod. She dispatched the Raspberry Pi from the transport and unstopped herself. She was still getting a strange
bass sound from her headset. She moved towards the pod and took off.</p>
<p>As she was exiting the moon there was a large explosion. She looked down in horror to see that the moon had split, creating several
parts of the moon. The parts were attached only just, but this couldn't be good for Earth. The effects this would have on Earth would
be devastating. Maybe she wouldn't be able to return to Earth. Mars was an option - Humans had set up a base on the planet in case
something ever happened. It was mainly run by ArtControl machines but several hundred humans were preserved there as a backup for
humankind.</p>
<p>6b345 had curled into a small cube to fit inside the pod. They had made their way into the supply and inventory area where hopefully
they wouldn't be noticed. To preserve power they switched off the camo and would switch it on if someone entered the area or once
they landed back on earth.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
        <div>
<p>this is a great script editer! I am testing this.
Hello from the otherside!</p>
<p>This is my novel for November 2015.</p>
<p>The clock had struck midnight. The single light bulb flickered. His fingers clicked the keys. Eyes moving back and forward on the screen. Private
returned an error. There was no way he believed this was happening. The private key was broken and meant he wasa unable to connect to the server.
Something had happened and the key had became corrupted. Perhaps he needed a break. When crap like this happened the best option was to walk away.
He stood up from this chair. Taking a long sigh he walked towards the door. The muscles on his thighs stang. The long was he had taken eariler that day
had taken a toll on his body.</p>
<p>He switched the jug on. Tapping his feet. 'I need some music he thought'. Reaching in his pocket he pulled out his Samsung cellphone. It was running
a modified version of Debian. Unlocking the phone he tapped the music icon. A list of stations appeared. 'oh the choices', he spoke. 'Who are you talking
to hun', a voice came from another room. A woman walked into the room. 'Oh Hi Babe', he spoke. I didn't hear you return - 'how was work?'.
Sarah stepped out of her office. The rain poured. 'Joey are you coming?', she yelled over her shoulder. ' one moment, just cleaning up', Joey replied.
Joey scrambled down the stairs to catch up with Sarah. She was holding the door open for him. ' Sorry about that, needed to finish off corrupting
that private key', he told Sarah. 'Did it work?', she replied as they both stepped into the rain. Joey nodded as they began walking down the street
together.</p>
<p>The sky was turning black as they continued to walk down the road together, arms locked together. The streets were deserted. Old cars were burning on
the street. Sirens scretched in the distance.do you thin thy are coming for us, joey asked sarah. ' There are bigger problems for the police to
deal with than us', sarah replied. careful, watch your step, she added. A burning bumper from a vehile lay on the path. The two carefully steped over.
Not much further to go, joey said. 'It's just around this corner'. The two walked around the corner and turned into a narrow alleyway. They walked
past several abanded building before reaching a door which read: number 6 techfuncmasters.</p>
<p>'This is it', Sarah wispered. She raised her hand and gave two solid knocked on the door. They heard movement inside as someone moved towards the door.
'whos there', a voice spoke. 'Sarah and Joey Macfurson', spoke sarah. The door crecked open. A man in his mid 40 stood.in front of them. He was
tall - 6 foot 5 with a long brown beard and blue eyes. His head was saved. He wore circal glasses. ' i am Uganka ', he spoke in a eastern european
accent. He held his hand out and shook both Joeys, followed by Sarahs hands. 'it is nice to meet you finally ', Joey said as he shook Uganka's
hand with a strong grip. 'Please come in out of this rain', Uganka greeted them into the building. The two stepped into the door. 'Please follow me',
Uganka spoke as he started to was down the hall way. Saray and Joey followed the man, arms still linked together.</p>
<p>They reached the end of the hall and stopped at a steel door. Uganka stopped. ' Is something wrong? ', Sarah asked. 'This is your last chance to leave',
spoke. Uganka. 'ther is no turning back from here'. 'no we wnt to do this', both Joey and Sarah spoke. 'very well', uganka spoke as he unlocked the
steel door. They walked into a room that was pitch black. Sarah grabbed Joeys arm in fear. Ã­ts ok, joey wispered.  The steel door behind them slammed
shut and they both jumped. Purple and red lazers starting wizzing around. 'Where is Uganka', asked Joey. The man that had lead them into the room
was gone. A wizzing noice started. Growing louder, andd louder. Sarah and Joey let go of each other and held their hands to their ears. Along with
the wizzing sound increasing a new sound began - sirens. The two dropped to the ground. Sarah was the first to screem and started moving in a
circle motionon the ground. Joey started screaming shortly afterwards.  The sound was deafening. Suddently the room flashed with lightning as the noise
stoppeed. The room returned to norma lighting, but the room was empty. Both Sarah and Joey had vanished.</p>
<p>The light flicked as Antoney lay back on his comoputer chair. On his left monitor he has the latest epoise of the telvison show 'Linus'. On his
central monitor had a web browser open with a IPython Notebook running. The right monitor had test resultsbeing displays. Three terminal windows,
all displaying results of his code changes. CCTV monitors hovered above these three monitors. This kept an eye on other rooms in the building along with
outside and views from the street. He had tapped into the cities traffic cameras and was getting a realtime feed of the surounding street. Should
any trouble head his way - he would know and be able to make a quick exit.</p>
<p>alert: inruder in section 31 spoke a voice. Antoney glanced away from the television show to the cctv monitors. 'switch to room 18', he spoke.
Thee monitor zoomed in on a camera in room 18. 'hmm, that stange', antoney thought to himself. The room looked normal. 'Maybe Ineed to check it out
myself', he rose from his chair and started walking towards the steel door. He unlocked it and walked in. The room was pitch black. 'somethings
wrong', he spoke. 'This. can't be happening'. Lights switched on and everything was normal. 'So strange', he spoke.
Antoney caucioly walked through the room heading toward room 18. He peaked around the hallway corner. Empty. He started walking down the hallway.
Suddenly he heard a womans screem and frooze. 'Who the hell is there', he yelled. Now he knew there was an inruder. He reached for his handgun
in his pouch. He was armed and ready. i have a gun', he warneddd. the intruder as he contined walking towards the screem. He reached the door. The
letters 18 read on it. im going to enter, he warned. Gun drawn he busted the door open.</p>
<p>A woman lay in the center of the floor. She was naked and covered in blood. 'Who are you, and how did you get in here', Antony asked the woman. He
lowered his weapon and creeped lcloser to the woman. At thihs point he had relised she was no harm. Her screaming stopped as she noticedd him.
'i am sarah', she spook. She leapt from the ground and wrapped her body around Anttony. He was a little shocked to have this woman suddenly
over him. In his arms she sobs. 'now,  now, he spoke, pating him on the back. he gently pushed her off him, moving her to an office seat.
'lets find you a blanket', he said. He spots a rugs that he wraps around you.
'How did you get here', Antony asks Sarah. Still shacking she repied with, 'The last thing I remember is purple and red lights'.
'hmm, interesting', spoke Antony. 'What is todays date?', asks Antony. 'The date..', Sarah pauses. 'It is November 21st 2065'.
Antonys draw drops. 'You believe the year is 2065?'. Sarah gives him a confused look. 'Sarah, it's the year 3532'.</p>
<p>Antony switched on the jug and started making him himself a coffee. As he poured the water a voice apeared from behind him.</p>
<p>Joey typed on the keyboard. S.T.A.R.T.S.Y.S.E.M. Return. The machines main led light switched to green. A wirling sound begins as the machine
starts up. Joey fixes his glasses as he nervously waits to see if the boot happens. He had tested it and all the tests had passed. The bios
had finished loading and the machine was booting the kernal. This was the most progress the machine had done. Scientists had worked for years
to develop this machine. The room was airgapped and blocked all radio signals. This was to stop interference from any outside source. Crackers
had attempted to modify the machine so it was imported that it was kept secure. The building it was stored in was on the 10th floor of the building,
inside another building. Large fenced surrounded each of the builds with turrets to shoot anything that moved.
It was not posible for anyone to reach the machine. Even the machine that Joey was controling wasn't the real machine but was instead sending off
signals to the real machine. This meant if the fake machine was comporomised then the true machine would still be safe.</p>
<p>The handed on the clock ticked over to three thiry two. LED lights on the panel displayed the year November 21st 2065. Twenty percent of the time
the machine got the time collabration correct but from time to time an error accured.</p>
<p>Linus stood in front of the crowd. A grin on his face and a laptop under his arm. The television show 'Linus' had just won awards for the best
Drama and Linus had won an award for best actor. He didn't feel much like an actor. He waved as the crowd cheered. Cameras flashed. Linus bowed
and posed for the camera. One of his security personal whispered into his ear, 'sir we need to move'. Linus nodded and waved to his fans before
entering the steel door. The room inside the steel door was bright. Monitors filled the desks. Wirling sounds rose from the computers. The machine
began to speak. 'Command Speak'.
Joey steared in amazment. It was miminicing his commands. 'open gimp', he spoke. 'Opening gimp', the machine replied.</p>
<p>ItWillBeMine steered at her computer her eyes flicking left to write. Reading the text on the screen. 'I"M GOING TO COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND MURDER
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY', the message wrote. 'Another death threat', she sighed to herself. She had been getting these increasingly since she became
a mod of RedditGetsDrawn.</p>
<p>She had a boring job. Sitting at a desk all day and ringing clients to try to sell them antivirus software. She knew herself that the software
was spyware. Clients installing the software on their machines meant that the company was able to use the machine to look at all their data.
It was closed source so no one was able to know what the software really did. It didn't protect people it harmed them.</p>
<p>She partically liked to ban developers that attempted to produce artwork. If she a office telemarketer wasnt able to draw she didnt want to
let developers draw.</p>
<p>ArtControl had started painting people on RedditGetsDrawn long before ItWillBeMine.</p>
<p>Why did ItWillBeMine take over the subreddit? What could be done instead. Allow all artists. There is no such thing as troll artwork.</p>
<p>ArtControl had been partically annoying for her. They had developed a script to create a new account for every piece of artwork they created
- submitted. They did alot of artwork - sometimes up to 30 pieces a day. That is up to 30 accounts her and other mods needed to find everyday
and ban. The script caused the artwork to be sent via message to the original poster, along a with mod mail. The art was uploaded to several
different places - but all redirect to artcontrol. This meant when they tried to ban a certain domain the artwork had been uploaded</p>
<p>ArtControl developed the machine to create and submit artwork to RedditGetsDrawn. They had grown tired of painting everyday but still wanted
to create art for the people of RedditGetsDrawn. The machine would look at all the reference images uploaded to GetDrawn via the api. It then
choice the best reference to draw. The machine painted the same way as ArtControl painted - it started the a white landscape document and
added a line layer, followed by grayscale and finally colour. The AI of the machine was able to match up the reference with the history of
ArtControls paintings, creating a unique pience of artwork in the same style as ArtControl.</p>
<p>It was a hot summer day on in Florida. St Andrews High School had just finished morning tea and the students were taking their streets.
Sirens approched the school. Swat team burst into classroom 14. 'Get on the ground', yelled an officer. The students and tutor scremed
and dropped to the ground. 'Which one is Vanessa May?', an officer asked the teacher. 9 officers cicled the students. They didn't seem
interested in the teacher. 'I am Vanessa', a quiet voice raised from the back. Offices moved to the back. Four officers stood over the
girl, who was trembling. 'Vanessa, you are under arrest', the lead officer said as another officer culfed the girl. 'Anything you say
may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attnery, if you cant afford one then one will be apointed for you,'
Do you understand', the lead officer told her. Vanessa nodded.</p>
<p>The officers escorted Vanessa out of the school building. The class stared at her as she exited the room.</p>
<p>'Class is dismissed', announced the computer. 'Be sure to have the reports ready for the next class on ArtControl: The Machine of Art'.
The robatic student stood up imediatly and walked out of the room in single file. 'Confiumed Master. Goodbye', the students spoke as they
exited the room.</p>
<p>Where you are going there are no roads.</p>
<p>ItWillBeMine was at home when she heard her private number ring. She had just banned 5 accounts of ArtControl. They had hired a programmer
to write a script that searched for art submissions that used ArtContols common colour. They wanted to match his style but it was becoming
difficut. She really wanted to find the machine that he was using to create these paintings. If she could get her hands on the machine
she will be able to stop him from posting once and for all.</p>
<p>He had been posting on RedditGetsDrawn for over 30 years. He was famous and loved on the subreddit except for her. She considered his
work troll art. Artcontrol had devoited his life to creating software and hardware to create artwork. They started small - creating
small scripts to building a fully automated machine that would mimic his painting style.</p>
<p>ItWillBeMine slowly climbed out of her seat. She had grown fat over the years from a poor diet and spending too much time sitting down.
She never walked, and rarely went outside. Her exhusband would pick her up for work daily. Her husband - Micheal grown tired of her
laziness and bad attatute and left her for another woman. He was much happier, but still saw her during the week when she picked
her up for work and dropped her off at home afterwards.</p>
<p>They split custoly of their daughter - she would 7 days at her monthers, followed by 7 days at her fathers. At the start of the sepration
Micheal got the majority of the time. She only spent every second weekend at her Mothers as the court decided she was unfit for a split
cusoley.</p>
<p>ItWillBeMine picked the phone up before the final ring. It had been setup to disconet the call if the phone was answered at the wrong
time. 'Hello', she spoke into the speaker. 'ItWillBeMine', a males voice replied. 'Yes, Who is this?', asked ItWillBeMine.
'This is dective Hans Lonery, I'm afaird to enforme you that we have your daughter. We need you to come down to the station'.</p>
<p>Art hold secret symbolism for a secret cult.</p>
<p>The artwork produced by the Machine was in being used to encrupt documents from the goverment. It allowed private keys to be created out
of artwork. The holder of public keys were able to recreate the artwork with their own ArtControl machine that was a copy of the original.
The hashes were matched to make sure none</p>
<p>Have something change, one mistake changes the future.</p>
<p>ArtControls light switched from red to green as it started to power up. It loaded the bios from the memory card. In its old system the bios
caused a mafanction which meant the kernal failed to load. The new bios had been original developed by Joey and Sarah. The system was open
source and has recieved contrubitions from thousands of people.
The system was originally developed to create artwork in the style of an artist. After the artist passed away they named the system after him.
The machine still creates artwork in the style of the artist but its system had been developed much further to do other tasks.
They were being created and trained in schools to in order to create a better future today.</p>
<p>Humans had started using ArtControl machines in space in order to explore areas that were too dangerous for humans. They were equipted with a
camera that took high res images - 160000 by 8000 pixels. The machines were able to paint scenes that could not be photographed.
NASA had order 1.3 million units that were to be sent to different areas.</p>

<p>Tonight i am testing my tablet with some writing. This tablet is old but seens to work ok.
One problem I have with it is that I have been unable to download.
I just ssaved it incase I lose my work. That is not going to happen is it?
This november there is going to be a worldwide writing challange - nanowrite. It involves writing 50,000 words in a month.
2014 was the first year that I attempted the challange. I managed 8,000 works or so.</p>
<p>Ideas for the book this year:</p>
<p>Autobio - write about my life so far.</p>
<p>RedditGetsDrawn - write about redditgets drawn. A day in the life of it will be mine.
ppo queem of peace always does it berrerc :-)</p>
<p>The Letter</p>
<p>Linus mouth dropped. The patch that he had applied had broken namespace.
He threw his monitor to the ground in anger and stormed out the room.
'Zombies steps', Linus spoke as he demostrated his walking desk. To his left was an old desk.
Harddrives and wires skattted the desk. 'That's my old desk' - he pointed towards the desk.
'The walking desk is better for my back'. He steared at a sleak 23 inch monitor as he moved his legs.
Typing he replied to an email.   Matthew has forked the kernal. To add BSD style securename.
Linus welcomed the idea. He only care about two things. Technology and the kernal.
Cheers erupted from the crowd. Fingers twitched as people updated their social media networks with the news.</p>
<p>The camera man switched the stream to a portrait of Linus. A smug grin covered his face. The claps from the crowd quietened.

<p>LET'S SPRINT: A NEW(ISH) MODEL TO MAKE OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES</p>
<p>BY MATT MCGREGOR</p>
<p>This post introduces some ideas for the 2016 OER Sprints. If you want to get involved, you can:</p>
<p>join our organising group (on a platform called Loomio)</p>
<p>fill out the expression of interest form</p>
<p>check out the existing task-list for the events</p>
<p>LETS SPRINT!</p>
<p>Earlier this week, we announced our plans to organise the Great 2016 Open Educational Resource Sprints.</p>
<p>As I said in my post last week, were getting a critical mass of schools with Creative Commons policies,
which are enabling teachers to legally share and collaborate. This is good news, of course, but the
risk is that the policy becomes just a piece of paper, to which no one really pays all that much attention.</p>
<p>It's our opinion at CCANZ that its about time we put these policies into practice, and show how kiwi teachers
can work together to make new, open resources.</p>
<p>Hence, the Sprints. But when you announce a new idea like an OER Sprint, you quickly find people asking a few quite important questions.</p>
<p>WHAT'S A SPRINT, ANYWAY?</p>
<p>Lets begin with the first one. What's a sprint?</p>
<p>A resource sprint is an idea borrowed from the technology sector, where it is sometimes called a hack
'The GovHack' weekends are one example of technologists, designers and a range of other volunteers
coming together to make new products and services from open government data and information.</p>
<p>In the education sector, one of the big examples that inspired us was the Media Text Hack (theres that word again),
where a team of educators and researchers got together to write an open Media Studies textbook. It's now an assigned
undergraduate textbook at the University of Otago.</p>
<p>The other example - which itself inspired the Media Text Hack team - was the Oppikirjamaraton (that's Finnish for - textbook marathon).
This event involved about thirty Finnish mathematics educators writing a new textbook for schools.</p>
<p>Both of these events give us working models of how an OER Sprint might work.
Both organising teams have also been open about the problems they had during the event (such as technology -surprise, surprise)
and what they would do differently.</p>
<p>DECISIONS, DECISIONS</p>
<p>Despite these fantastic examples, there's still a heap of details about the event that we need to figure out. We've decided to open
up the process early, so everyone can see how our decisions are being made. Hopefully, at the end, we have a model that schools,
associations and informal groups of teachers can use to sprint - or hack - their way to the resources they need.</p>
<p>So, what do we need to think about? I'll be reflecting on these issues over the next few months - both here at NZCommons and in our
open Loomio group, with other volunteer organisers. But here's a few to get us started.</p>
<p>How long should it last for?</p>
<p>Some sprints last for two days, others just one. Some sprints keep strict, family-friendly time-frames,
while others keep working deep into the night. My feeling is that we ought to keep it short and sweet i.e a busy 9/10-5 - for either
one or two days, though with an expectation than many participants won't be able to commit for the full period.</p>
<p>Technology the bane of many such events. We'll need to find a technical platform that works for everyone.
My initial thinking is that Google Docs will work fine for small teams, and is a technology many teachers already use.
Some bigger projects with many more collaborators  have had issues with using Google Docs, and more technical platforms
like Github have also been problematic.</p>
<p>Participants, volunteers and facilitators.</p>
<p>What skills do we need?</p>
<p>And whatâs the best mix of practising teachers, non-teaching subject-area experts (like academics), facilitators
and other volunteers? My feeling is that we need to keep the focus of the event as âby teachers, for teachers,
with other volunteers serving to support the needs of the participants teachers. At the same time, we want to take
advantage of the collective expertise of everyone who wants to help out.</p>
<p>What's a resource?</p>
<p>Other sprints have focused on making single book (or book-like entity). My feeling is that a resource is whatever the
heck participants decide to make on the day, and that this should be the decision of each individual team.</p>
<p>Team formation:</p>
<p>what constitutes a team? How many people?</p>
<p>3-6 seems about right, though I'm not sure about this.</p>
<p>What about virtual participation? If we're working on Google docs, this is fine though virtual collaboration
can breed those dreaded Technological Problems, which well want to avoid. But we shouldn't put any barriers
on people participating, either.</p>
<p>What will the events actually look like?</p>
<p>My assumption is that it will involve people sitting at tables, talking and typing. We should try to minimise
the amount of scene-setting at the beginning, and look to have a plethora of helpers to solve problems as they arise.
This will involve giving clear guidance beforehand. A minor amount of faffing about at the beginning is probably unavoidable.
How much does it cost? From our point of view, there are two sorts of costs: event costs; and outreach costs, before and
after the event. For the event, we'll need funding or in-kind sponsorship to cover food, drink, venue, technology and
other incidental costs. For the outreach, we'll need funding to get resources on CC and OER to as many teachers as possible.
Finally, how many events? Weâre not sure, yet, though before the end of the year, we should make some initial committments.
I'm obviously keen to have them anywhere and everywhere, though this will depend on us getting strong local support.</p>

<p>William Mckee is an artist, programmer, early childhood educater, and writer. His artsite is artcontrol.me and is available under a
Creative Commons BY 4.0 licence.</p>
<p>During highschool William spend the majority of his time in the Design creating designs in Freehand, after finishing he attended UCOL in
Palmerston North. Here he became seriously interested in drawing and gained confidence - many thanks to his drawing tutor Mark Dustin. He worked
mostly in a a4 visual diary which became a habbit and still carries a sketchbook whereever he goes with him now.
During his time at Palmerston North School of Design he registed the domain artcontrol.me and creating the site</p>
<p>artcontrol.me: The Art Of William Mckee.
Was created in 2010 as a site to host his artwork. Previously he had used DeviantArt and Wordpress.com blogs to host his artwork.
The site was originally hosted by GoDaddy the operating system CentOS, and powered by Wordpress. Originally it was licenced under  CC NCBY
but William later decided that the NC licence was wrong and switched to CC BY. He later swtiched from WordPress to Nikola - a Python static
site generater. He later also switched hosting to DigitalOcean with the operating system Debian.
The majority of his machines are running Debian. Fedora is on a couple.</p>
<p>At first he choose to licence this under a creative commons nc by licence. Later making the decision for cc by removing the nc licence.
He has many problems with the nc licence and would never use it again and don't see many reasons for people to use it.
He has a problem with education, govt, and publicly funded works to be under nc. The good thing the majority of govt seems to be under cc by.
Certain schools in the county have a nc licence which is troubling - especially when all schools have it.</p>
<p>In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended The Learning Connexion.
It was here that he focused on life drawing which he was only dabbed with in the past.
GIMP was used for all the digital paintings created. He painted on a windows desktop and laptop.
Later he switched to Fedora and Debian. He painted rarely but enjoys painting with the Raspberry Pi computer and
Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait and figures were drawn from references on RedditGetsDrawn.
He would draw portraits of people and give them the drawing - taking a photo for his own reference.
At the bottom of the page he would signit with wcmckee artcontrol.me and write cc by on the piece of original artwork.
These were mostly completely in pencil and coloured pencil.
William is passionate about working with children. In 2014 he volunteered at Whaihanga Early Learning Centre.
His Mother - Linda worked there as the head teacher. His favourite activities were the art area and build structures with wooden blocks.
He would work collaboratively with kids often on the same piece of art. Oil pastel, pencil, and coloured pencil were the most commons media
choices. He was very influenced by the children's drawings - often redrawing elements of their works. A hope was the children learn that art
was about sharing and remixing - something Creative Commons has at its core. William took the liberty and licenced these works under a cc by
licence - photographing and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me. He would create large chalk murals on the ground outside.
Hulk, Spiderman, Bane, and Batman were common requests of characters to draw from the children. These mural pieces were created on the fenceline
of Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School.
Swarms of school children would crowd the fenceline - watching and discussing the artwork with him.
They were often blown away from how quickly he worked. Some of the collab works were developed further with digital painting. He volunteered at Fairfield Community Centre where he drew with children aged 5 to 12.
Felt tip pen was the main media here and he applied much the same techniques with collaboration as at Whaihanga.</p>
<p>From 2012 to 2014 william would draw and paint people from  the Reddit subreddit RedditGetsDrawn. Some days he drew up to thirty people. He
recived many positive comments from people thanking them for their artwork.
Sadly in 2014 William was banned from submitting artwork to the subreddit - being accused from the mods that his artwork is troll artwork.
His website features in in the RGD as exams of troll artwork.
William created the website GetsDrawn.com that scrapes RedditGetsDrawn for reference images as a response for this. This has enabled him to have
an offline version of all the reference images on RedditGetsDrawn.
When asked for a unban he gets laughed at by the mods.
The mods are a bunch of SJW woman who are talentless - in partical ItWillBeMine.
William still draws people on RedditGetsDrawn and sends them artwork but doesn't submit it publicly as it is always deleted by the mods.</p>

<p>The site was live. It was running on a simple python web server but it worked. The script was exacuted by the Raspberry Pi B+ computer running Debian.

<p>Alfred Bunnings
09:00
01/Nov/2014
InfoSec
everything seems fine
Charlie MacDonald sat at his desk steering at the monitor. 'Alfred Bunnings, who is this guy?', he thought to himself. 'Jones, get over here and see this', Charlie yelled out to his Assistent. 'Coming Sir!', a voice sharply replied. Into Charlies office walked Jones. Tall, 6 foot 3. Dark Brown hair, curly and down to his shoulders. On this day his hair was tied up, usually he left it down but today was special. 'What's up sir', Jones asked, squinting at the monitor. 'Take a look for yourself', replied Charlie as he stood up. Jones took a seat at Charlies computer station. Charlie paced up and down his office. 'Sir, I've seen nothing like this before. What the hell is going on?', Jones asked Charlie. Standing still Charlie spoke: 'It's a god damn nightmare that is, this Alfred character has breached the networks. We need to find them.'</p>
<p>Alfred sat on the bus. The same seat he had every day. The bus was old, 50 years old and rust was pealing rom the rail. At least the button still works. He was on his way to visit an old friend, he hasn't seen in five years. Normally lfred drives his car but today was different. He felt like relaxing on the buss. His Dell laptop sat on his lap. The desktop enviorment was KDE, running Debian. He dudn't have much running. Two web browser windows, a terminal, and Pithos. On the left split was his IPython Notebook (running locallly), on the right split documation web page that he is following. The terminal window was behind the web page window. A TMUX session was running. The was split into three windows. Inside the sessoion was The IPython Notebook Kernal running on port 80. One the second window - Motion. This is used to capture save mpeg files from the Dell laptop camera.</p>
<p>The Streets were playing on Pithos. Stay Positive. Pithos is a desktop client for Pandora Radio.</p>
<p>SPIKE INFOSEC</p>
<p>The sign read. Alfred stood looking up above him. The skyscraper went on for miles. Squinting he could see the peak.</p>
<p>Today he was here for a job interview. Two days ago he had been sent a message that a position had came up and the company was interested in hiring him.</p>
<p>The automate doors opened as he approched them. Inside stood three security guards and a metal detotor. 'Name and reason/person visit', one of the guards asked him. 'Alfred Bunnings, I'm here for a job interview with Janet Pears'. The guard typed characters into the comput 'Alright, that seems fine sir', the guard replied'. 'Please make your way down the hall and take the second right on your left'. 'Thank you', Afred said as he begain walking down the hallway.</p>
<p>Everything was white. The ground, ceiling and floor. He passed the first turn off on the left and kept walking. He reached the second turn and turned left.</p>
<p>The colour scheme changed, colours filled the walls. Character and Landscapes scatted the walls. It was painted with a dark naples yellow, red, and a light blue. The backgrounds were blue and the characters and foreground landscapes were yellow and red.</p>
<p>Alfred admired the walls as he contined walking down the hallway. At the end of the hallway was a foylor with several desks setup with computers. A woman sat at the further one typing. The foylar was plainer than the hallway. Art murels still scatted the area, but they were less freuent. The are had a light blue background, with yellow and red character and landscape artwork. She looked up and smiled at Alfred. 'You must be Alfred', she exampled. Alfred approched her desk and held out he hand to shake it. 'I'm Janet', she said - shaking his hand. 'Take a seat Alfred'.</p>
<p>Alfred looked back at the sign on the building.</p>
<p>SPIKE INFOSEC</p>
<p>Twenty years he had worked there. Today he was moving on, had sold his shares of the company. He approched the doors. They opened automatitly. Three security guards stood there. All with very serious looks on their faces. Unlike the day he walked into the building for a job interview the guards were humanoild shaped robots. The guard looked and sounded like the same security guards on that first day. Under their fake human skin was just metal and wires.
'Morning fellas', Alfred said as he flashed his ID badge and walked down the corodilol. The corodor was still completely white, like the first time he entered the building. He walked down the hallway. Passing the first door on the left, and turning left at the second turn. The murals had changed. The colour scheme had stayed the same but the images had changed. Alfred had contrubited several times to the repainting of the murals. It was a annual event, each year five people are awarded with the job of recreating the murals. He wondered down the colourful hallway. During his third year working for Spike Infosec he won along with four other people - Noel Locksmart, Elizebeth Goodwill, Trist Gardens, and Ali Turbon. Individially they started by working on sketches. He reached the foylor - desks with computers scatted the foylor. This was the main room where people worked. It was an open space, and the desks had wheels on so they were able to be moved around the building freely. There were several breakoff rooms where smaller groups could go to work.</p>
<p>Alfred scanned the room. People filled the desks. Sitting or standing they typed. 'Today is special', a familar voice for Alfred sounds from behind a monitor. Janets face poped out, with a smile. 'Goodmorning Janet', Alfred smiled. Janet rose from her chair. 'Time for a coffee I believe', she said. Janet hadn't aged a day csince Alfred met her. She had long straiht brunette hair. Light complection skin, with frekles covering her face. She wore skinny horozonal glasses that had a light blue tint. On this day she wore a long silky dress. Her black leather jacket was spread out over the back of her computer chair. On her desk sat three wireless 22 inch monitors. One keyboard. One mouse. One drawing tablet. One tablet pen. Janet spent her days at work either coding or digital painting. She had the freedom to choose. If she didn't feel like painting that day, she could code instead. Her paintings were quick. Nothing took more than 45 mins. She was working on a logo. 'Spike InfoSec' it read. A furry spikey character held the sign. It's long sloopy tail weiving between the rocks on the ground. The software used for the digital painting was GIMP. Like all software developed and used by Spike InfoSec it is open source and free.</p>
<p>The dinosaur roared as Alfred held a large piece of steak. It's nose drew near and sniffed. 'Smells delicious', the dinosaur thought to itself. Alfred pushed the meat closer to the dinos nostrols. It spat green slime at Alfred and turned it's back and left in a huff. Jsnet hid in the bush nearby waiting for the dino to move out of sight. Alfred was covered in a green slime liquid. It had caused his body to go into shock and shutdown. Janet had to reach Alfred and reboot his system. She creeped closer to Alfreds still body. The dino sniffed the air. Janet stopped moving frozen. The dino continued walking. Janet rushed towards Alfred and grabbed his body. The Dino looked back and saw her moving away. He turned and bagan to give chase to Janet and Alfred. Scrabbambing up a tree Janet was safe from the dino. She had saved Alfred. The dino growed and circed the tree. It scratched the bark from the tree as it grew inpatienct. Janet reached for her backpack and revealed a cellphone. She dialed the number 6 3 2 1 4 5 1. Suddently the dino froze, it had been shutdown. Janet climbed down the tree, still holding onto Alfreds lifeless body. She stepped over the dinos body. Lifeless but the dino never was alive. It was another machine created to hunt her down. She had created them to help people, to make peoples lives easier. But they took her ideas and created evil. The Dark Shape was created by them. Janet never programmed her robots to kill people but others had taken the software and added kill commands. It had created great evil in the universe.</p>
<p>The planet Earth population had dropped to just a few thousand people in a matter of days. The machines released a toxin into the oxagin which caused the humans to choke to death. It was a quick death, but it spread quickly and was extremely contagious. Within an hour of the toxin being released half of the worlds population was dead. Over the next twenty four hour it wiped out 99.9% of mankind. Some people that held a special gene were immune. These people were scattedd about the world. Research was to be taken by a group of machines loyal to the humans which wanted to restore mankind. Working together with the few remaining humans they developed a device which allowed dispursion in time. The toxic grew complex and inserted itself into the dispursion of time and then spread the mutated toxic to people in the future, where they had found a cure. This caused the cycle to happen again - 99.9% of the world population was dead in under 24 hours. The remaining human had to find a way to give the cure to a large amount of humans without the machines noticing. They relized that having the machines help them in the cure was useless. They machines would spread their knowlege of the cure to enemy machines which would then develop a mutated toxic that the cure was useless against. The humans worked on traveling back with the cure and stopping the toxic waas being created in the first place. This is their story.</p>
<p>The ground that Janet walked on was rough. Stones cut into her barefeet. The sun blinded her view, she held her arm above her eyes. Attempting to block out the rays. A figure amurged in the distance.. Squinting she made haste towards the figure. As she drew closer she noticed the figure was a copy of herself. A clone. 'You must be Janet', Janet exampled. 'Yes, how do you know?', replied the machine. 'Because you are a clone of myself, and my name is Janet'. The machine stood still. 'Do you know why I am here', Janet asked the machine. 'Because you are afraid of the evils that you brought into this world', the machine spoke slowly. 'You are here to find a cure', the machine went on. 'But I will warn you young one, there is no cure here, only toxics', the machine collabsed to the ground covered in a green slime texture.</p>
<p>The number generater returned Noel Locksmart, Elizebeth Goodwill, Trist Gardens, and Ali Turbon. They were inserted into the text in order. Identitys were created. Credit Cards were the main source. Creating a fake identity and building up depit, and not paying it back. Janet scanned the card. Elizebeth Goodwill it the name on the license read. Born 06/11/2014. Spike Infosec: Help Desk 4. The photo was of a straight hair brunete in her early 20s, with frekles covering her face, petite. The room reveled a server room with walkways. Goodwill plugged the patch cable from the router. Connected on the otherside was a Raspberry Pi. A green and yellow light turned on by the ethernet port. It had a network. For development and testing Elizebeth perfered to use her own network connection. Truck skretched to a halt on the street. Three toots. Both truck doors opened and two men leaped out. They begain walking towards the propatery at the end of the street. Goodwill could hear several people moving about outside. She triggered her rewind time script. Time slipped back thirty mins. This gave her enough time to exit her home and make it to saftely before the assassians arrived again. The drone showed three people exiting the truck. Two men and a woman. As they scretched to a halt outside the house of Elizebeth Goodwill, was in fact Janet lived there. It was a setup. The house was trapped so that when they entered - they were never going to leave again. Thirty years Noel Locksmart had been a prisnor in the house. He will never forget the night. It was just a standard robbery. Locksmart had recieved word of a computer scientice by the name of Elizebeth Goodwill that had developed software that allowed the replaying of events in the past. The system was complex but started with just one script when Goodwill was just six years old. It was a login and logout script. The first script was the login script. This created a JSON object that included firstname, lastname, date (04/Nov/2014), time (hr:min), reason, and comment. The logout script added to the JSON object logout date, time, and comment. She wrote the script in the programming language Python. Her father - Charlie MacDonald had taught her from an early age the basics of programming. She enjoyed it so carried on. At a four year old she was involved in setting up a programming club for children. This idea spread to other towns, cities, and countries. Goodwill would travel with her Father and give demos and talks on their software development. Goodwill went on to co-founder the software development, infomation security, robotics design company: Spike InfoSec.</p>
<p>Ali Turbon wislied as he mixed the Indian spice together. Pandora radio was playing from his bluetooth speaker. It was on the family dinner table. Next to the speaker was a nonbranded laptop running Fedora. KDE was the desktop enviorment. Firefox was open with a IPython Notebook on the screen. This window was on the left side of the monitor. On the right top side of the monitor a television show played. It was George Benson played. 'Onions are ready to go, confirm? Y/n', a device in Turbon's left chefs jacket beeped. Turbon reached for his phone and hit enter. Three claws reached inside the cubord and picked up an onion each. The bench was a woodern bench. The claws dropped the onions on the bench then went back to the cubard to collect more onions. Several more trips back and forward then the claws switched into the next phase - cutting of the onion. The onions were lined up perfectly on the bench. Three rows, five collums. Fifteen onions. Chef knives snapped out of the claws of the device and started to cut up the onions. Each onion was cut in half, then quarters, and finally sliced. The onions were scopped up and droped into a pan of oil to fry. Once the onions were a lovely gold color they were tiped into a slow cooker. 'Carrots are ready to go, confirm? Y/n', the device The claws grabbed a orange carrot and dropped it on the bench. The same amount of carrots were used as onions. The knives cut the carrots by a slice lengthways in half, then quarters, and finally slicing. Scopped up by the claws they are dropped in a pan to be fried with oil. Once goldern the carrots are tipped into the slow cooker. Fifteen cups of soft chickpeas are tipped into the pan of oil and fried. They are tipped into the slow cooker. Fifteen medium sized tomatoes travel through the room, being griped by the claw. They are crushed and tipped into the slowcooker.
Five tea spoons of Indian spice mix is tipped into the slowcooker. 'Coconuts are ready to go, confirm? Y/n', beeped the device in Turbons hand. Enter was hit. The claws moved towards the cubard to retreave the coconuts. Seven medium sized ripe coconuts are dropped on the woodern bench. The knife snaps out of the claw and cuts the coconut clean in half. The claw snaps the knife away and revieles a sharp scoop. The white coconut insides are cut, scooped and tiped into the slowcooker. 'Item ready to cook. Is there anything else?', the device spoke. The voice was that of Trist Gardens. Her voice was sharp and clear. She spoke with confidence and joy. 'Fifteen garlic and salt', Turbon requested. 'Garlic are ready to go, confirm Y/n', the device beeped. Turbon slammed the enter key. The claws moved to the cubards and dragged out fifteen cloves of garlic. The knives snapped out and sliced it up finely. Garlic was scooped up and tipped into the slow cooker. 'Salt is ready to go, conf', before the device had finished beeping Tubon hit the enter key. Salt was tipped into the slow cooker. 'Item read to cook. Is there anything else?', Gardens voice asked. 'Confirm', Turbon confirmed. The claws began mixxing the slowcooker mixture together. Turbon had a late order for a chickpea curry that he was putting though last mintute. It was a Sunday night and he had a client that wanted a Chickpea Curry for lunch on Monday despritly. Normally he charges extra for weekend food orders but this night he made an exception. This client was special and he knew business would be better in the future because of it. A raspberry Pi and Audino powered his commucial resturont cooking device. His cellphone was connected to the raspberry pi computer that was connected to the Audino. The laptop was his portable devlopment machine. Turbon pressed a button a door opened. Server room with racks of servers running. small selfdriving cars moved up and down the hallway. The cars were careful to avoid Turbon as he walled down the hallway. He nodded at each car as they passed by. The cars had no wheels and moved along the ground by twisting. They moved along with the awkward twist movement. Rubberlike commpletion. Majority of the cars were a yellow and red colour scheme. Several had grayscale colour scheme and traveled in groups of three to five. The grayscale moved slower than the colour scheme and was quick to move out the way when one was heading towards them. Turbons reached a door. It was a large door, double his height. He banged at the door three times. The device in his pocket beeped, 'door status: open'. Turbon turned the handle and opened the door. He stepped into the room. Mid gray covered the room. A dark shape sat in the corner, reading a newspaper. Turbon paused as his eyes noticed the black shape. he was pulled closer and began walking towards the shape. He stood in front of the shape. 'Chickpea Curry is ready to go, confirm Y/n', Turbons spoke. A page of the newspaper was flicked over. Turbon waited, frozen. 'Confirm', a sound came from the black shape. The voice was that of Trist Gardens. She still continued to read the newspaper. Turbons dropped sixteen bags of curries. In each bag were 5 trays of curry. Eighty trays of curry in total. Every tray of curry also came with a tray of rice. Turbon dropped another sixteen bags. In each of these bags were 5 trays of rice. 'Enjoy your curry', Turbons said. 'Thank you', the voice of Gardens replied. The dark shape placed the newspaper beside them and stood up. They took the bags of curries and slowly walked towards the door with a large green exit sign at the end of the far wall. Turbons stood frozen untill he heard the exit door close behind the figure. He let out a sigh of relief. 'That went better than expected', Alfred spoke. 'Certainly sir, that was much calmer than last time', the voice of Gardens replied. Turbons had to be careful of these anonous bots that were being created. Last time he did an order of curries the bot attacked him and this lab. He had yet to figure out who sent the attack bot but had captured it for tests. He had increased secutiry in order to protect himself and business. Anon Bots that enter the building are now scanned with anti-malware software to test if it had code to attack. Turbons created a white list of bots that he allows to enter. Some of these do have attack code on their system but Turbons trusted the owner that they would not attack. 'Why would people want to attack a kitchen?', was the thought going through his brain. The Police arrived quickly after recieving the emergency signal. Detective Henry Pharrs was in charge of the case. Pharrs was in his late 50s, he had been in the force for 25 year. For 8 years before joining the force he worked as a computer analizt for Spike InfoSec. Today he was investagating a robots that opened fire in a room of humans. Robots created by humans were unable to kill other humans but the robots built robots that had the kill command in the system. Pharrs had studied the kill comand in robots his whole life. His father - Johns Pharrs had studied the kill command much of his life. His Son continued to reasearch the kill command. The goal was to find a cure.</p>
<p>The door slammed behind the dark shaped as it entered the building. Three security guards stood in front. He moved forward ignoring the guards. They said nothing and didn't move. The alarm went off as the dark shape passed through the dectoror. A guard hit a switch and the alarm stopped. The dark shape moved down the hallway reaching the second door on the left. It turned left. As it passed, the artwork on the walls turned from a bright primary colour scheme to a grayscale, black and white scheme. The Dark Shape left a bitter taste in the air. It reached the foylor. Desks weree empty. It began to wislle as it walked around the desks. The Dark Spaes head darted back and forward between desks, looking for something. It's head stopped moving - staring at an item on a desk it moved closer. An item sparkled from the desk. The black shape reached out and picked up the item and placed it inside their pocket. It turned around and walked out of the building. Shortly after The Dark Shape left the building, it explodes.</p>
<p>Fire engine roars down the road towards the building on fire. The Dark Shape walks down the country side as the engine passes him. Corn fields populate the farm land here. Flying drones fly above the corn - monitoring. The Dark Shape smiles as thir bare feet crunch on the grass. It feels better than the cloth feeing the building had. The Dark Shape turned and watch dark clouds of smoke emurging into the sky.</p>
<p>The engine arrived at the building. Much of the building was englufed in flame but the fighters would do their best to save it. Humanolid Robot jumped out of the fire engine and entered the building to check for human that may be still in the building. Two of the bots forced the front door open and entered the building. Three security guards stood there englufed in flames. They just beeped gibbish as the firefighters soaked them in anti flame powdered. The flames died down. The fighters contained down the hallway, spraying the ani flame powder as they moved. One fighter opened the first door on the left. He entered a large foylor area. Desktop with computers on were englufed in flames. The fighter began to spray the powder at the computer. He noticed a humon figure in the room. It was sitting in the far corner sitting at the desk typing on a keyboard. 'Must be a bot, can't be human', the fighter thought to himself. He moved closed to the humanold typing. The fact it didn't stopped typing is strange. Usually an emergeny mode activates when the bots are in danger. The activates a call to authorities and begins a self-repair task. The fighter sprayed the bot with anti flame powder. It continued to type.</p>
<p>Charlie MacDonald. Rest in Peace. The grave stone read. Born 24 October 2014. Died 12 December 2093. Trist Gardens stood over the grave. Tears flowing from her eyes. It had been two months since MacDonald passed away. She had worked with him for fifteen years at Spike InfoSec. Together they worked on a automatic cooking device. It was used in billions of home and businesses around the world. Spike InfoSec realeased blueprints of the device so anyone with a 3d printer can just print the device.</p>
<p>Drone hovered by MacDonalds head. The claw was attached to a woodern board. MacDonald placed a onion on the board. 'Cut', he spoke clearly. 'Confirm', the device beeped back. A knive snapped out of the claw and sliced the onion in half. A smile rose on MacDonalds face. 'Jones, get over here and see this'. The door opened and Jones walked towards MacDonald. 'What is it sir?', Jones asked. 'Watch this Jones', MacDonald said as he placed a onion on the woodern board. 'Cut', he spoke once again. 'Confirm', the device deeped back. The knife snapped out. The onion was sliced clean in half. 'wonderful work sir', Jones smiled. 'Kill Jones', MacDonald spoke, his eyes fixed on Jones. The knife snapped out of the claw and started traveling towards Jones. Jones terrified started moving backwards towards the door. He turned and began running towards the door. The knife traveled faster through the air.Janet Pears A cracking sound shoock the room as the knife impayed the brain of Jones. His head was attached to the door. Part of the knife was impayed into the door. It was a instant death. MacDonald didn't have a choice. He was on orders from Trist Gardens. If he didn't follow through and kill his assistant his whole families lives were in danger. 'Clean this up', MacDonald spoke as he walked out of his office. He stood in the foylor. Light blue covered the area. MacDonald could see Janet in distance. She was interviewing a new comer. Alfred Bunnings his name was. MacDonald watched as Janet and Alfred shook hands and took a seat. 'He looks like a good test subject', MacDonad spoke. 'Test subject: Alfred Bunnings', the device beeped back. 'Confirm', MacDonald confirmed. MacDonald continued to watch Janet and Alfred as they talked. 'So tell me about yourself', Janet had the first question. MacDonald had known Janet since she was a toddler. He would push her on the swings in the local park. MacDonalds daughter Elizebeth Goodwill would also be swinging. The Black Cat sat and watched the swings, following the figures in the seats as they moved backwards and forward. 'Black', a voice behind called and The Black Cat twisted around. The Black Cat moved towards the voice. A dark black shape stood in the distance pouring fresh meat into the cats contaiiner. 'Thanks ma'am', The Black Cat spoke, he began eating the meat. The Black Cat was a prototype for the humonald bot. It was used for testing. Under the fake fur and skin was metal and wires. A raspberry Pi computer inside the model with a cell phone and audino connected to that. Human like personioltys were added to the computer. The speech The park ranger - Alfred Bunnings had created this one. He had printed the parts and soultered the robot together. Installing the software was easy - it was all in the software store. Bunnings also worked on scripts for Black. Today he was testing a script that made the robot smell and taste food. As people were pushing their children on the swing he ordered for a humonald robot to activate in the park and send off a signal to attract Black back. This script could be used in many areas but Bunnings was developing it so he could find lost or stolen robots. Many times people come into the Park and walk away with a robot. Sometimes I don't relize it. They thing they have made a new friend but really it's a computer belonging to the park. The Park gets an alert that a bot has entered an unauthorised area and sends back gps data. The Park gives the person a friendly phone call or email and offers to either pick the robot up or let the person return the robot themselves. As long as the robot is returned the Park is not worried. Once the robot is returned it's rebooted in order to clear memories of leaving the park. The Park does not want robots remembering what is outside The Park as it causes more robots wanting to leave the park. Rebooting them isn't a problem but there is better work that the staff could be working on - such as new features. Black purred as he ate the fresh meat from his bowl. The little girl on the swing with straight brunette hair hoped off the swing and ran toward Black. He purred louder as the girl - Elizebeth Goodwill patted Black. The adult continued to push the other child - a girl with blonde hair and a darker completion than Goodwill. The Farm had rows of vegetables growing. On the pathway around the veges walked humonald robots working on the garden. Bunnings walked past the onion gardens. He smiled at the group of humanold robots in suits discussing the Onion garden. 'We need to speed haviousting up by 150% in the next three weeks', Bunnings overheard them as he walked past. The Onion Gardens were thriving. A cold and wet June month meant rain every day. The claw pulled the onion and dropped it into the crate with the rest of the onions that had been havested. The Claw moved fast, pulling another onion out of the ground in less than two seconds. Bunnings whisiled a tune as he walked past the Onion Gardens. Harvesting was excellent with the onions this year. They were experiencing a demand in onions and had increased the amount of The Claw that worked on the gardens. Bunnings entereded the carrot gardens. These parsely like vegetables added sweetness to the companies curries. Bunnings watched a The Claw plucked the carrots from the ground and dropped them in large containers. The next step for the carrots was washing, then it entered the kitchen. Bunnings entereed the tomatoe gardens. Rich red tomatoes grew on the stalk. In this garden the company used humonald robots as a majority over the claw. The humonalds were given custom arms that allows for careful picking of the tomatoes. The tomatoes were dropped into containers where they were washed and moved into the kitchen. The herb gardens were next. Here coroondir and other herbs were grown for the Indian Spice Mix.</p>
<p>The Resturent was where customers could come and eat, or take away curry. Open 24hour/7days. They also offered a delivery service. Humanold robots greeted the customers and showed them to their seat. If they were takeaway they offered a room to sit and read magazines/books. A room that is filled with computers - these are running 24 hours and offer swipe card assess. Security cameras and drones operate in the building to keep an eye on everything. Secuirity drones analze the cameras for any unusual activity. Tonight they had found a human bot spiking the food with toxin. Camera 532 had spoted the crime. A Claw drone spoted the activity on the monitor. Alarms had already activated. Secutiry drones and bots headed towards the area. The human bot that was spiking the food activated a self return to base mode. It caused the bot to turn invisible and extremely tiny - the size of a mouse. The bot was still able to travel at fast speeds but it was also small like a mouse, and invisible. Devices had been developed that allowed for tracking of invisible units. The Claw Drones had invisible cloaking devices build in. This allowed them to become invisible for up to 48 hours. They can enter a sleep mode that allows them to run for months without needed to land. They are able to charge themselves remotly by downloading charge off a connection. This allowed more advance space travel by allowing humans to send robots which could self repair and charge. This allowed robots leaving earth to a far away planet that took thousands of years to reach. The robots finally reached the planet and sent back message to earth on the news. It took the robots 8,500 years to reach the planet. The news took 2,500 years to arrive. The message reached Earth on December 18th 3543. The humans that sent the bots into space and to the planet had long since extint. Some of the older robots on Earth rememberd the mission and were able to decode the news file. It gave the robots great exciment that these robots had reached the planet and news had arrived back. The Robots of Earth created a time warp portal and linked to the robots on the planet. They ere able to travel between planets instantly. For the robots it felt like they had just woken up from a sleep. They work with the robots in order to get a toxic sent back in time to wipe out a certain group of humans that later develop a toxin that wipes out the human race. The toxin that is sent back is a success but spreads to forign targets - only activating again in 6 generations. When the toxin activates the nervious system in the throat stop working, causing the person to choke to death. A similar kill program was writen for the robots. It caused the robots harddrive to corrupt spreading the corruption to other systems. "I'm feeling better now", The Claw said to the humanold robot. The Claw was loading onions from the garden to the containers. These onions had been enjected with a toxin that would later cause much of the human race to die. The toxins had been placed in the onions by robots in the future with the help from a few remainings humans. Their plan was to wipeout a certain amount of humans, presuving human life in the future. Robots more in the future realized that this was a mistake and sent robots back in order to revirse the toxin. The only way for the toxin to not be created was to make sure the Spike InfoSec never waas founded. Humans were sent back in order to stop the foundation. Janet Goodwill was the number one target. The humans killed Goodwill many times but each time it was a clone. If the human form of Janet Goodwill is killed then the humans can insert the toxin into her system - sending it back generations. This simple exercise causes the company Spike InfoSec to never be founded. Alfred stood outside an empty building. He looked up. He remembers there was a Spike InfoSec sign hanging here. Instead it's a old video game store mixed with a coke logo, both fading and pealing off. The glass sliding doors didnt excist. A woodern door stood in front of Alfred. He turned the handle. It opened to a small foylor that looks like it was used for a small supermarket. Old broken trolies were scatted around the room. Cobwebs covered the room. A rat scatted accross the room. Followed by a black cat. Alfred walked down the hallway - it was filled with posters from ancient movies. They were faded and pealing off the room. Behind was a light blue textured wallpaper. the ground was a grey-blue carpet. It despritly needed a clean as dirt and grime covered it.</p>
<p>The humanolid robot monitored the children. Four children to every one humanold robot. The robots only monitored and did not interact with them. For every eight children one human teacher. Sixteen children, one support worker. It was all in the math. 113</p>
<p>How shell this day end?</p>
<p>on top of tht shr hda to decife to fire him for the leaking of private documents. her private key was broken</p>
<p>He had plans to create his own Infomation Security company.</p>

<p>150 dragon eggs have been stolen from the dragons when they were sleeping after celebrating the year of the dragon. When all the dragons were fast asleep Bianca her evil team of 'rhynocs' came and steal all 150 dragon eggs. Bianca and the rhynocs work for The Sorceress. Just as they are taking the last egg the dragons wake up and see an egg go down a hole, to the forgotten world. None of the dragons could fit down the hole so Spyro the Dragon and friends decide to go down and save all 150 eggs...
There are 36 levels and 4 different worlds. I each level there is at least one challenge except the 4 levels that toy are different creatures. The worlds are big and there are lots of things to find and explore. In each level there are different tasks that you must complete to earn dragon eggs.
The money in the forgotten world is gems. You can find gems just lying around the place. You need gems to pay Moneybags. If you give gems to Moneybags he will open up travel routes, activate doors, bridges and open up some other playable creatures. Well here is the review....</p>
<p>Sound 8/10:
Still has the same music from Spyro one, and two. Spyroâs voice has deepened. The creatures in the different worlds have very funny voices! They will make you laugh!</p>
<p>Gameplay 10/10:
It is not just a platform game it's a first person shooter, skateboarding, boxing and more! You would spend hours playing the mini games. Heaps of things to do and explore</p>
<p>Lifespan 7.5/10:
Well I finished it in a week and found it quite easy, but I played it for like 4 hours a day! So if you don't rush through it, it will last for a while.</p>
<p>Graphics 9/10:
The graphics are very good and colorful. It was fine no glitches or anything. The FMV's were not very good.</p>
<p>Controls 9/10:
Spyro has good controls, which are easy to get use to. He doesn't have roll any more like he had on Spyro two. Agent 9 has the worst controls he has a quite good attack but he can't do much, his first person shooting games are quite good they are a bit like Point Blank and games like that!</p>
<p>Overall 8.5/10: (gave it a 9 for game FAQ)
A great game with great Gameplay and graphics. A little short and too easy</p>
<p>Rent or Buy:
Buy. The mini games will be fun for a very long time</p>

<p>If you liked Tony Hawk Skateboarding then you would like Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX...</p>
<p>Graphics: 8/10
The graphics are fairly good. The game glitches in places and you would have trouble getting out this is usually on walls or in corners, especially in park editor. The levels have been well made. They are big and have lots of things to do. The videos are amazing, as they are real.</p>
<p>Lifespan: 9.5/10
It is quite a hard game at first but after you have gotten to know all the good moves, gaps, and where everything is the game is lots easier. There are quite a few people to complete it with plus their are some secret ones you can open up. Each player has different special moves that no other player has. Each one is also has different stats. 'The park editor' this is a really cool feature but it is not very good when you have a bunch of friends waiting for a go. It takes a long time to make a good skate park. You would spend a very long time playing two players as it has 3 types of modes:
Trick Mode: Two players at the same time battle it out to see who can get the most points in two min's.
Graffiti Mode: Two players at the same time do moves to see who gets the most things graffiti.
Horse Mode: Two players at different times do the best move they can to try to bet the other person's score.</p>
<p>Sound: 7/10
OK, the music on it is very poor. I usually turn the music off. The bike sound is all right so do the players. I hope in future Mat Hoffman games there is better music.</p>
<p>Gameplay: 8/10
The gameplay is not very good because you do the mostly the same things in each level for example: High Score, Pro Score, Hidden Mag, Collect 'TRICK', Hit 5 or so things such as lights, Bins, Toilets.</p>
<p>Overall: 8.1/10 (round to 8 for game FAQ)
A really good game with great lifespan</p>
<p>Buy or Rent:
I would have to say rent if you really like the game then buy it. Mat Hoffman's pro BMX 2 is on PS 2 and I have heard it is a better game then the first one if you would like to get it.</p>
<p>Moves:
There are heaps of different moves to master. There is also things called manuals. People that have played Tony Hawk's would know what I mean. There is two types of manuals nose manuals and manuals, You can get heaps of points if you do a manual after or before you do a move or grind. Each time you do a move the point value for it decrees.</p>
