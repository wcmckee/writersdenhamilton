Detectives skin was normal. In some of the visions Vanessa was experiencing of him his skin was
red and infected. To find out what was going to happen next. Vanessa moved up to Detective. He looked suprised, happy to see
Vanessa. She began to undo the straps around him, and get him out. Her plan for when he was out was to travel back to Mars with
Detective. She had no idea what happened to Antony. He had disapeared from the ship. Vanessa thought that maybe Detective had
gone back and changed events. She wanted to review the tapes and see if there were any differences between the two.
Vanessa worked quickly  searching through the tabes to findf out what changed. They had been keeping records and live updates
of a range of timelines. She drank a coffee from her left hand and typed with the other. Her words per minute were impressive.
She was top of her classes. Her Mother and Father were both very proud of her. What she was searching for was any information
that will lead her to find out what hppaned with Detective when he was sent back. She had been researching newspapers reporting
strange events that he could be involved in. One interesting moment Vanessa found was when the humans of Earth sent 80,000 humans
to Mars. She was able to retrieve articles from several timelines and noticed difference in the events that occured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa and Detective landed the ship on Mars. A large group were waiting for them to arrive - including Detectives parents. They
were releaved to see him - believing that he was dead and gone forever. Vanessa needed to interview Detective to find out some
of the events that she was not sure about. They wanted to analze Detectives body to try to find out what Antony injected into his
system. Vanessa walked into the lab. Detective was seated on a seat,
no cuffs this time. Vanessa had the results for Detectives brain and
body scans. After the two returned to Mars they decidied to study what
Detective had happened to him. They started from the lounge - when
Detective was eating eggs and watching the television and went into a
fit, killing him. Antony bursts into the room, grabs detective and
heads to space with a ship. Antony liked classical music and would
always have music playing when he flew ships. Public Domain but he
used Creative Commons BY as well. After this test it worked
successfuly. Antony was happy that a experiement finally worked. After
a large change in the wordcount the software was finally working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no sign of Antony. Vanessa rewatched the security footage that showed Antony disapeared when Detective actives the
time split device. A similar event had happened with Detecive when he was traveling - he found a copy of himself and injected himself
with a substance - causing the copy body to disapear.
6b345 was a great help in working out what happened to Antony. 6b345 had been with Antony shortly after it arrived on Mars. Before
that 6b345 spent time with Sarah. Originally the machine was designed to be a open education resource creater for the education
sector before being moved to the space program. 6b345 had always perfered to be in the education secton and felt a little uneasy
when the govt moved it to the space program. It compilied with the requests. It was given a full militery upgrade for the transfer.
The work in space was far more dangerous than working in the classrooms. It was a normal day for 6b345 when the security breach
happened. He had no idea when it happened. Just suddenly he lost control of his actions and thoughts - someone else controlling
his system. He was unable to send an emergency call back to Earth that his system had been taken over. Whoever had taken over his
system had disabled the ability for him to send the messages.
6b345 was powerless. He idly sat by and watched his body destory the other research bots with him. They didn't fire back at him.
It happened too quick. Whoever that was controlling him, knew what they were doing. After the other bots were dead the explosives
were set. When control is given back to 6b345 the memory of the seacurity breach is removed. 6b345 returns to normal when Sarah
arrives on the Moon, following her off the Moon. 6b345 had managed to
stay hidden from Sarah untill they arived on Mars. It was here 6b345
lead Sarah into the trap if Antony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey arrives on Mars through time split device. He finds 6b345 and
puts him back together. The time that Joey is in is after Detective is
returned to Mars after being sent back in time with Antony. Joeys time
on Mars is the present timeline. Everything else is behind. There can
be no future past Joeys timeline. They thought he was special because
it is something that he does that causes the device to stop working at
that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens to ItWillBeMine when she leaves the cars in the robot dominated timeline? She glitches and is sent to to this line.
She had already been killed and wasn't spose to be there. After escaping the car she hunts down Loth'Rak who has recently landed
on Earth. She is lead to believe that he may be able to help her. ItWillBeMine locates Loth'Rake who is tied up in a building. She
breaks in and get him out, avoiding the robotic troops. No one ever finds out exactly what happens to Antony after he disapears from
the ship. Vanessa had visions of him breaking through from other timelines but she believes that he no longer excists here and is
unable to get back completely. She is happy as he is dangerous and would likely create more monsterous creatures like himself and
Blitz. Antony was always a big fan of Blitz. The Humans on Mars created a statue of Antony that had him patting his cat Blitz.
'Antony - the monster that never exsisted', the stone read. Many came to view the statue and learn more about Antony and the
developments that had happened around them. Even though he was considered by most to be evil and sinister there were good parts of
him aswell. Some even sided with him - beliveing if he didn't kill Sarah then mankind wouldn't survive on Mars. Many people were
split into two group, argueing about the issue. It was hard to pinpoint excacpty what happened.
The events will be remembed in history. It was a very stange period of time. Nothing quite like it had happened before, and nothing
was ever going to happen again. Generations afterwards studies the events. It was taught in school, in univercitys. Professers
continued to write papers on the events, spinning new perspectives on how events happened. Detective was the final of them all to
die. It wasn't long after he returned to Mars. His genes had became corrupt leading to a spread amoung the humans on mars. Vanessa
didn't relize this until it was too late. Antonys plan all along was to get Detective back to Mars. Vanessa had fooled for it.
That's why he wasn't on the ship. Antony had timed it so that he would be erased from this timeline and apear in another. Vanessa
wouldn't suspect anything when Antony wasn't on the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah moved towards the transport pod. She was several hundrad meters out from it. She took long strides in her space suit,
staying focus on the target. Even though this was only training she wanted to score top marks for the pratice mission. Others would
be completing a similar training mission to her and the ones with top marks will complete the real mission. She had been preparing
for this training for years and now it was finally happening. Sarah
had reached the transport. She watched in the distance an explosion
happen. The transport that she had just climbed into went flying. All
around her the explosives erupted. Sarah had arrived on the Earths
Moon on a bad day. The simulation was blowing up the Moon and training
astronautes to travel to the Mars if something ever happens. The
Humans knew it was going to happy so they decided to prep for it. By
doing so ment that they forced the event to happen, because they were
so obsessed with it going to happen - it happened. If they had ignored
it, forgot about it - it may not have been so bad. Each time it got
worse and worse. They had always encourged people to prep for the
future. For the worse. People were buying small transport pods that
would get them off the Earth should the attack happen. It drove
everyone insane until it happened. Sometimes there is a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holidays they decleared were March 16 Sarah, June 24 Antony. Every
year on these days people would gather at the statues of these
historic beings. They were going to be remembered long after they are
gone. The whole period of time was going to be remembered. It was only
a matter of time before a winner arose. That winnder was Sarah. Her
parents were there on the day she was announced the winner. That she
would be the one sento to the Earths Moon for the mission. She had a
series of goals to complete. She had been training for years and was
going to be successfully complete her Moon mission. Sarah couldn't
wait to leave and staying on Earth was making her not able to sleep
correctly. She woke multipy times in the night. After the doctors
checked her they told her that she may be unsuitable to go on the Moon
mission of she was going to be going on this mission then her health
needed to improve. Sarah got back on track and preped for launch. She
was in top health when she takes off from Earth to the Moon. It is a
solo mission that she is on and it's going to be tested now. Her
Mother and Father were there the day her ship launched to the
Moon. 'Whats new pussy cat', was playing on the over head speakers. It
brought a smile to Sarahs face as she climbed inside the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not good when Antony was sad. He would go into rages and trash the room he was in. Druming his arms against the floor. This
was more rage than sadness. There were several moments when Antony
went into these rages. Once was when he found out about his Father. It
caused to major distress and burnt down his home. When he was creating
his experiements he went into a rage several times. The first was when
The Bee failed. It caused him to burn down the lab and he had to build
a new one. He regreated burning down the lab as it costed him alot of
time. All his research was backed up so he didn't lose that. He
believed it was important that the science is able to be
reproduced. He had starting sharing his results online. 'Antony
creates a friend', was the name of the blog where he wrote daily posts
and uploaded the formulas. Antonys guide to zombie creation 101. He
had maintained it, updating it with journal notes daily, photographs
of setups and results. He wanted to show everyone else that what he
was doing was posible and everyone else could do it as well. There was
nothing stopping them from doing a better job than what he was
creating. On an afternoon after the site went live his webserver
almost overloaded from requests. People were obsessed with his videos
that he was producing and the content that was being made. All the
files were in text format. This made it easy for people to do what
they wanted with the files. The files were licenced under a free

web/software/videogame developer, writer,
public speaker, photographer, videographer,
and educater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He volunteers for Creative Commons NZ
helping to promote Creative Commons in
the Hamilton area and through organisions
he is involved with - artcontrol, Writers
Den Hamilton, Hamilton Computer Club,
Hamilton Library. Everything he creates
is licenced under a Creative Commons license,
with preference for the more libral, and
open culture licences - CC BY and CC BY-SA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His art can be found at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://artcontrol.me/"&gt;http://artcontrol.me/&lt;/a&gt; and is
available under a Creative Commons
Attribution (BY) licence.
William is a supporter, user, and developer of
open source software and hardware. He is passionate
about early childhood education having volunteered for&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Creative Commons is useful to an artist to promote
the work and it makes the world a better place," says
William. "Others may find uses for my art
and even make money from it, good on them!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During High School William spent the majority
of his senior years in the Design room. Spenting the majority of his time creating vector
designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William became interested in
drawing after leaving high school and
attending UCOL in Palmerston North.
There he had a drawing tutor, Mark,
who inspired him to keep a drawing journal.
William gained the habit of carrying a
sketchbook wherever
he goes, along with a pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William created the site artcontrol.me:
The Art Of William Mckee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site was created for a home for William
to host his artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally powered by WordPress, he has since
switched to the Python static website
generator - Nikola. This powers his various sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hosted with GoDaddy and ran CentOS. The site was powered by WordPress,
switching later to Nikola.
He later also switched this to DigitalOcean
with the operating system Debian, which is
used by the majority of his machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well William was always interested in using
a Creative Commons licence, he at first
chose to use a more restrictive
Attribution-NonCommercial (BY-NC) licence
for his artworks, though soon chose to use
the liberal Attribution (BY) licence.
William doesn't see many reasons for artists
to use NC licences, and finds it especially
problematic when NC licensing is used by
governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As William argues, "Tax payers have already
paid for the material. It should therefore be licensed under the most liberal licences
(perhaps even public domain/creativecommons
zero). This allows the most freedom for
people to do what they like with the content."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of aribution. Everyone should be
licencing their copyright work under a Create Commons Attribution licence or
zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William also point out that the
"Non-Commercial licences are hard to
interpret, as was noted in a German court
case in 2014, which strongly limited the
interpretation of NC to 'personal use.'
Similar problems with the interpretation
of NC could exist in other countries.
This is why I think everyone should avoid
the NC licence. I would actually prefer that
the NC licence not exist in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing, Williams says, is that the
majority of New Zealand government works
released under CC seems to be under CC BY,
though he is concerned that some schools
seem to have adopted an NC licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended
The Learning Connexion, where he began to
focus on life drawing. This was created on
brown paper with an easel. Pencil, coloured
pencil, oil pastel, acrylic paint, gouche,
watercolours were the media that he used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William had done digital painting since
attending UCOL with illustration classes.
He used a Wacon tablet. Currently for his
digital painting William uses an Intous 5
small tablet connected to a Raspberry Pi
computer. The software he uses is GIMP 2.8
and it is running the operating system
Rasbian (Debian Jessie, Stable). William uses
a batery pack plugged into the Pi to power it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William uses the Pi to edit text. Plugging
in a keyboard and uses terminal with the
softwarenano to edit text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digial later focused on portraits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;using GIMP, an free and open source
raster graphics software. William began by
painting on a windows desktop and laptop,
later switching to Fedora and Debian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait
and figures were drawn from references on
RedditGetsDrawn. During this period,
William would draw portraits of people and
give them the drawing - taking a photo for
his own reference.
At the bottom of the page he would sign
with wcmckee artcontrol.me and write 'cc by'
on the piece of original artwork.
These were mostly completely in pencil
and coloured pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William is also passionate about working
with children. In 2014 he volunteered at
Whaihanga Early Learning Centre,
where he would work collaboratively with
kids, often on the same piece of art,
using oil pastel, pencil, and coloured
pencil.
He was influenced by the children's artwork
- often redrawing elements of their works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William took the liberty of licensing these
works under a CC BY licence - photographing
and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me.
He would create large chalk murals on the
ground outside, with children requested that
he draw comic book characters like the Hulk,
Spiderman, Bane, and Batman. These mural
pieces were created on the fenceline of
Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School.
Swarms of school children would crowd the
fenceline - watching and discussing the
artwork with him. They were blown away
from how quickly he worked and the
quality of his artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A hope of mine," William says,
"was the children would learn that art was
about sharing and remixing - something
Creative Commons has at its core."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William has since become a volunteer for
Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand,
helping to spread the word about
Creative Commons licensing in
the Hamilton region.

He had just enough to give Detective an injection when he awoke.
once there live a man who lived in a big house
hr had everything he wanted in that house. To tell you the truth that house was in fact
not a house but it was a spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa had located Antony's ship. She didn't want to get too close to hi ship or
he might notice her. She decided to
exit her spaceship and travel through space towards his ship - getting a
good inside - and maybe even entering the ship. She had left her ship out of the radar of his ship. If he was scanning then
her ship would
be detected. Vanessa stepped into the suit. It had been specially designed to have boosters elements so that she is able to
travel in the space
quickly for a short period of time. The booster wasn't able to be detected from the ships radar and Vanessa was able to grab
onto Antony's ship and view through the windows on what was happening. Vanessa peaked through the window. She could see
Detective strapped to a chair. His arms and legs were tied down with leather straps. Detective was sitting in a seat
across from him - drinking a cup of coffee. From what Sarah could see Detective looked alive. He was sleeping but he had life
in him. 'What did Antony do to bring him back to life?' Sarah wondered, scratching her head. She needed to get inside the ship.
She needed to wake Detective and capture Antony. She was going to need to find a way to break into the ship without being
detected. The emergency hatches were all alarmed so unless she was able to get in there without setting the alarms off that
was out of the question. Cutting through the ship or finding an insecure entry was the only way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah had with her a communication
device with her that allowed 6b345 to scan events and give suggestions on the next course of step. '6b345 do you come in',
Sarah spoke into the microphone. 'This is 6b345 responding. You are coming in clear Sarah,' the voice of 6b345 replied.
'Can you get a scan done on that ship, I need to know how I can get in without setting off the alarms,' Sarah asked.
'Scan Complete. Solution Found. I have sent the location and instructions for entry to the ship to your suits computer'.
New data recided the led lights blinked. Vanessa had received the information on how to get into the ship without being noticed.
She loaded the data up on her suits monitor. The plan looked safe and easy enough. She was worried about time and would have
to move quickly to get these steps completed. Vanessa was confident in her ability to complete the tasks. She boosted forward
keeping an eye out for a particle entry latch. She circled the ship several times before she finally spotted it. She moved
closer, reaching into her&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blah blah blah said Antony. Waiting for Detective to wake up
felt like a lifetime. He brewed him many cups of coffee and played endless video games well waiting. There was nothing to do
except to wait.
Antony often wondered what Detective would be doing at that point. He had no idea where Detective would be or what time.
There was a chance
that he could experience milt time lines on his travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His head hurt. The pain shot through his left side of the brain. He wanted to move, to get up. Stand up.
Move. He was strapped down.  The leather straps covering his wrists and angles. Looking around he reconsider the enviorment.
It was a prewar space ship. They didn't make them like this anymore. Everything about it was vintage. From the colour choices
to the style of the screws used to put the ship others. He tried to lift his right arm. It was strapped down with a leather
wrist. 'Help', Detective calls out. There is no response. Alone on a ship and strapped to a chair. The ship didn't sound like
it was on. The engines were silent. Looking over and out the window all he could see was darkness. Detective knew something
had changed. Antony was here before and now he's gone. The future changed when Detective went back. Now he was stuck here
strapped to a chair with nobody on board. He tried to think about the last time line he had experienced. Detective had grown
in control of the visions now, he was able to control them by stepping back and forward from the various lines. Sometimes
he finds it easier to experience one line over another, it all depend though. He could see a reflection of himself in the ships
window. His head was scabbed and bleeding. He had grown red sores all over his body which pusses with ooze. Detective couldn't
bear it. He clenched closed his eyes. The vision was still there though, another line where his face is normal, where there
are no scars. This is the future he wants. It's what he deserves. Detective has saved everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective found and captured Antony at a technology conference. It is the same conference Joey and Vanessa meet in. When
Detective gets sent back
from the spaceship he travels to a range of different times and chances many events. One events being the conference that
captures Antony at. Antony then actives the time switch on himself and is sent to another time. Detective and Antony are
chasing each other. The story tells all the events and different time line and how various characters. Events are changed,
changing the future that backfires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The is a journal through space and time following a series of characters in various evolution series of the human race.
An AI system is developed that clashes with an dying Alien life form developing part-alien, part-human child. This carries
on with mixing cat with the part-alien, part-human DNA. The Human race is wiped out therefore people are sent back to attempt
to change events that lead. Sara's Moon Training, Sarah Moon Trip, Presidents Speech, Loth'Rak bringing Antony to Earth,
Antony leaving Earth for mars, Antony killing Sarah, Sarah and Joey Time Splat room, robotic takeover - saves Loth'Rak
race. Antony is never created. Antony starts showing up in the time line through the device. No more characters. There is
already enough characters. There are some characters I'd like to merge into one or at least get new names. Structure could
really be looked at but that's something for the editing stages. For now just get down enough words to be a winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure walked down the road. Behind it the building was alight. Rich red flames burst from the ceiling. Mid gray smoke
billowed out above being blow to nearby houses with the strong wind. The CEO had just been informed that the building was
burning. The govt had been using it for top secret NSA and NASA missions. They had trained Sarah there to carry out the
Moon and Mars missions. As time distance increased they lost control of how much they could trace and realized that some
of the AI bots had lost communication with mission control. Sarah must find out what happened to the bots. She investigates the
scene on the Moon where a weapon battle took place between what looked like govt AI bots turning on each other. Govt denies
claim to any of these. Govt in meantime is scrambling to find out what happened to a selection of their bots on the Moon that
mysterious go offline and are not responding to connection attempts. Cameras and all on board security features were disabled.
Antony takes control of one of the bots - known as 6b345. He uses it to destroy Earth and brings Sarah back to Mars with 6b345.
Once on Mars Antony kills Sarah and takes full control of 6b345. Vanessa later takes control of 6b345 when Antony escapes Mars
kidnapping Detective on his escape. Vanessa tracks down Antony's ship, boarding it and killing Antony. She uses the time switch
device to go back and find Detective. He awakes to find nobody there. Vanessa arrives to rescue him. Detective was woken by
a noise inside the ship. One of the ships doors had opened. Someone had entered the ship. Detective panicked. Who would be in
the ship? He dreaded that it would be Antony. His goals in the past were to stop Antony from completing his goals. Deductive
thought it was a success when he awoke and Antony wasn't here. Detective was relieved when a woman stood in front of him,
not Antony. 'I'm here to get you out of here', the woman told Antony. He was released to hear those voices. He checked his
face in the ships window reflection. It was normal. His face was normal. He had successfully saved his appearance. Vanessa
introduced herself to him, untying the leather straps that held his arms and legs. Detective was released to be free. For too
long he had been tied to that chair. He is happy to be free and jumps into the air with joy. Vanessa hurries Detective along
they must get out of here and back to Mars. Vanessa takes control of Antony's ship and drives it back to Mars with Vanessa's
ship following behind on autopilot. She traveled back to Mars with Detective in Antonys ship with her ship following behind
on autopiolet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bee was the first live being that Antony had attempted to perform. He stunned the bee and injected his DNA into the system,
boosting the bee back to life. The Bee grew large and aggressive. Antony had to shoot the creation with the ray gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective gets his hands on a ray gun and kills Ugnanka and attempts to kill Joey and Sarah. In one time line he isn't there,
on the other he is. Crossing over happens all over the story. For example Detective find himself collapsed in another time lines
and drags the body into the cupboard so when Sarah and Joey look they don't see him. They find it strange though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Presidents Speech is important. It is told from many different perspectives and time lines. Detective has different roles
and goals each version of him there. He gives a speech after the president. Detective saves Joey who is in the crowd and would
be killed by the attack. Sarah is a girl watching the speech from television with her Mother.
Detective uses a stun gun on Joeys parents in order to get him out of there safely. Police notice the weird occurrences of
Detectives skills and start to investigate into him. Detective is spouse kill Joey at the conference but knows he's not spouse
to. Antony shows up at conference to do it himself and Detective captures Antony. Then Antony actives the time split device
and caused the two to travel to another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Humans on Earth developed an AI system by using alien technology that is sent back in time in order to change events. The
technology sent back was Detective. They studied him and learn how to beat his species, to save themselves. The Humans believed
that Loth'Rak and his son - Antony are behind the attack on Earth which wipes out mankind. People are sent back to change this
- making sure that events take place in order to secure 80,000 humans are taken to Mars to be preserved. Story followed events
to active these humans on Mars and the events following it. Basically it's about man kinds fight for survival over Earth is
destroyed and various conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony tried to talk to Loth'Rak about something but he should shot him down. This made Antony sad.&lt;/p&gt;

His art can be found at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://artcontrol.me/"&gt;http://artcontrol.me/&lt;/a&gt; and is available under a
Creative Commons Attribution (BY) licence. William is also a supporter and user of open source software, and is passionate about
early childhood education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I use Creative Commons as an artist in the hope that it helps promote my artwork, and to make the world a better place," says William.
"Others may find uses for my art and even make money from it, good on them!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William seriously became interested in drawing after leaving high school and attending UCOL in Palmerston North.
There he had a drawing tutor, Mark, who inspired him to keep a drawing journal. William gained the habit of carrying a sketchbook wherever
he goes, along with a pencil or pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his time at Palmerston North School of Design, William created the site artcontrol.me: The Art Of William Mckee.
It was hosted with GoDaddy and ran CentOS. The site was powered by WordPress, switching later to Nikola.
He later also switched this to DigitalOcean with the operating system Debian, which is used by the majority of his machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While William was always interested in using a Creative Commons licence, he at first chose to use a more restrictive
Attribution-NonCommercial (BY-NC) licence for his artworks, though soon chose to use the liberal Attribution (BY) licence.
William doesn't see many reasons for artists to use NC licences, and finds it especially problematic when NC licensing is used by governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As William argues, "Tax payers have already paid for the material. It should therefore be licensed under the most liberal licences
(perhaps even public domain/creativecommons zero). This allows the most freedom for people to do what they like with the content."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William also point out that the "Non-Commercial licences are hard to interpret, as was noted in a German court case in 2014,
which strongly limited the interpretation of NC to 'personal use.' Similar problems with the interpretation of NC could exist
in other countries. This is why I think government - and everyone, in fact - should avoid the NC licence.
I would actually prefer that the NC licence not exist in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing, Williams says, is that the majority of New Zealand government works released under CC seems to be under CC BY,
though he is concerned that some schools seem to have adopted an NC licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended The Learning Connexion, where he began to focus on life drawing, using GIMP,
an open source drawing and design tool. William began by painting on a windows desktop and laptop, later switching to
Fedora and Debian. Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait and figures were drawn from references on RedditGetsDrawn.
During this period, William would draw portraits of people and give them the drawing - taking a photo for his own reference.
At the bottom of the page he would sign with wcmckee artcontrol.me and write 'cc by' on the piece of original artwork.
These were mostly completely in pencil and coloured pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William is also passionate about working with children. In 2014 he volunteered at Whaihanga Early Learning Centre,
where he would work collaboratively with kids, often on the same piece of art, using oil pastel, pencil, and coloured pencil.
He was very influenced by the children's drawings - often redrawing elements of their works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William took the liberty of licensing these works under a CC BY licence - photographing and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me.
He would create large chalk murals on the ground outside, with children requested that he draw comic book characters like the Hulk,
Spiderman, Bane, and Batman. These mural pieces were created on the fenceline of Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School. Swarms of
school children would crowd the fenceline - watching and discussing the artwork with him. They were often blown away from how quickly he worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A hope of mine," William says, "was the children would learn that art was about sharing and remixing - something Creative Commons has at its core."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William has since become a volunteer for Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand, helping to spread the word about Creative Commons licensing in
the Hamilton region. If you want to volunteer, get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

is the separation of powers into the various independent branches of government,
usually in the form of the legislature that makes the laws,
a judiciary that interprets and applies the law and an executive that carries out
the administration and operations of governing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societies in the past were
relatively small and citizens were able to engage face-to-face or via handwritten
messages in their deliberation and decision-making process. As populations grew larger participation in a democracy required mediation,
i.e. communication is now mediated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest mass media was the newspaper, followed by the radio and television, and today, the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of its emerging function as a watchdog that monitors the running of the nation by exposing excesses and corruption, and holding those in power accountable, the media was regarded as the fourth estate,
supplementing the three branches of government by providing checks and balances. The media also plays a more basic role as a provider of
information necessary for rational debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>mediastudies</category><category>study</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/public-mediastudies.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 21 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>nanowrimo15-day22</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day22.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;'What could be preping for?,' Vanessa
wondered. She watches as Antony hands
Detective a device. Then the footage stops.
'Damn it', Vanessa curses.
Something happens that causes all the
eletronic devices in the area to stop
working. What they have created is a kill
switch, even if they don't relize it.
Vanessa stood up from her chair.
The camera footage from now is useless.
She needs to find out what that substance was
and how it brought Detective back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective agreed to the tasks that Antony
had shown him on the paper. He didn't
agree with them - they involved either
killing or hurting innocent people - people
that had no idea about their effect or
generations after them effect on society.
Steering at the list of names, dates and
times, and event almost brought him to
tears. He had to hold back his emotions.
If Antony had any idea that he was fully
consisious then he would be destoried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa had finished researching on the
substance that Antony injected into
Detectives brain - bringing him back to life.
She stood in his surgery room. This was a
hidden room in the palact that had a bunch
of terminal computers and a table for
performing surgerys. There was suspession
of something like this - but this was
horrific. Humans had been going missing and
Vanessa had just worked out what was
happening - Antony was capturing them and
performing surgery on them. He was using the
computers along with the traditinal medical
aplications. Vanessa had found evidence that
Antony was spicing DNA - mixing alien and
human genes together to create monsters like
himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6b345 and Blitz had been assisting Antony in
the lab. 6b345 had been riped to pieces when
they spaceship blew up entering the Earth
atmosphere. Bliz had died in the accident.
Vanessa had set the explosives on their ship
to explode when it entered the Earths
atmosphere. She hadn't expected it to blow
up over the building that she was attempting
to smuggle Joey out of - leading to a quick
escape.  It happened though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI Robot originally created to make art and
a cat mixed with Antonys human and alien
genes. The strangest of lab assistences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the wall was a framed painting of
Loth'Rak. Vanessa could reconise him. Antony
looked very similar to him. Antony had more
human features though. Loth'Rak was a
full alien, well Antony was only half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have they been talking about Vanessa, Antony,
and Detective too much with the focus taken
away from some other major events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to Sarah in the NASA testing
room. They were preping for the Moon blast.
The humans knew it was coming. When Detective
was sent back by Antony for the first time in
order to attempt to save Antony from being
driven out of Mars by Vanessa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6b345 changes a file that he finds on Mars so
that the robot uprising happens. This begins
when 6b345 finds a red usb on mars. It
contains the system details for the artcontrol
AI system that was developed to create art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference that Vanessa attended on Earth
was the Open Education Resource 2860. It was
organized by robots. They created open
education resources every day that were used
in teaching of the Humans on Mars.
Vanessa shows up and messys everything up
with crashing 6b345 and Blitz into the
building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need to write Blitz version of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blitz was born on 6 August 3555. The dust
on Mars were partickly bad that day. Antony
had created Blitz in the lab. He had mixed
cat, human, and his own human and alien gene
dna systems. It was the same process that
Loth'Rak used on a human and his alien genes.
Antony had memories from his Father and could
access all the skills that Loth'Rak posisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blitz had a speech impediment noticed by
Antony shortley after he created him. The
experiment created an alien like voice box
that became mutated by a virus that
contamanted the system. It lead to a bomb
being set by Vanessa inside of Blirz, leading
to their ship being burnt when entering the
Earths atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blitz strided down the road. She enjoying the
rain. On Mars it never rained but she had
seen photographs and diagrams of how rain
works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body of Blitz was cat-like but she had
two human arms coming out of the bottom of
her neck. Along with four cat like legs she
was a highly productive, agile, and super
creature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prototypes of Blitz had failed. Antony
had tried to create a mixture of his and a
animals genes for years. Each experiment
being a fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6b345 had been a great assist to the creation
of Blitz. Whenever Antony was in the lab he
6b345 was there with him to assist in the
experiments. They went through attempts of
mixing human and Antonys genes but failed.
They were using sick citizens on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony had poisoned the Human race that meant
they were unable to use the time shift device
The files that are on the red USB active the
AI system TechFuncMasters virus. It leads to
the death of all the humans on Earth. Humans
were sent to Mars in order to presurve mankind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story about a series of events that
are attempted to be manipilated by a time
traveler. The effects are grave and
unexpected where multi timelines
cross over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story focuses on a red usb that contains
a private key. It follows a series of differnt
and altenative events around this red usb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy the time you spend reading
it. It was created for NaNoWriMo 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the second attempt to write a novel
for NanoWriMo. The account has been active
since 2011. Only novels in 2013, 2014, and
2015 were created. In 2014 the novel
SpikeInfoSec was started. The total word count
was only around 7000 words. It was writen on
a raspberry pi computer using a IPython
Notebook in Markdown format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injection had lead to sores begin to cover
Detectives skin. Antony watched as his skin
became red and infected. He tried to use
substances to counter the effect but every
day it just got worse.
Detective had been in the coma for 3 years.
3 years of his brain switched off in this time
and active in others. When he traveled he would
of taken the time split device with him,
leading to switch between times as he saw fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015 for NaNoWriMo the novel
ItWillNotBeMine was created. With a goal of
1666 words per day. On day one and seven over
2900 words were written. The majority of days
over 1666 words were written. There were
several days when less than 1000 wc, these
were disapointing days but motivation to
increase the count the following days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel was writen on a HP Chromebook
with ChromeOS. It was typed in a Debian
Linux chroot on the Chromebook. It was
also typed on a Raspberry Pi computer with a
tft screen. On both of these devices,
terminal was used with the text editor nano.
For some of the days a Windows 7 computer
was used and software Notepad++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end a novel was created. It was 50,000
words, science fiction, a rough draft. I
published it to the Writers Den Hamilton site
as I wrote it. It's licenced under a Creative
Commons BY 4.0 licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to NaNoWriMo for the event,
Waikato NaNoWriMo, Writers Den Hamilton,
Hamilton Computer Club, Creative Commons New
Zealand and my family and friends for support
and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel is reaching 40,000 words and
decisions need to be made for the final days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No point worring about the structure. Work on
cleaning up plots and altenative perspectives
on events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the word count is reached the machine
gets to sleep. They have a certain word count
to make a day. How do they measure editing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robots just type files and the computer
builds the site and uploads the changes to
the webserver. Billions of words a day are
created. The robots are not told what to write
but instead just choose on what to write by
analizing data. This leads to more happy and
productive robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they were building the robots they relized
that if you made them sad they were less
productive. Telling them what to do was the
main thing that made them sad the data showed.
They fixed this by no longer telling the
robots what to do but instead let them sprint
freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey loved to sprint. His robot of course
loved it as well. The robot would show up
at the conference enter at 8am sharp, 7
days a week. They would then sprint for the
day - creating mostly Open Education
Resources. They were free to create whatever
they wanted though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novel is licenced under a Creative
Commons BY 4.0 licence.
I like this licence as it is free culture.
Many seem to obsessed with putting work under
a NC licence. Take a giant leap and don't
licence under NC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can only see people doing great stuff with
anything created. It's exciting see what
people might do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need to go through some of the older works
and find events and plots that need a cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write down the character and all the events,
times and suitrations that the character is
involved with - from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it epic and make it now. Let's get this
finished. The last few days should be a good
mofivater to get it finished. I will likely
have a burst to 50,000. Once I hit that I
will be done. I would like to start editing.
Maybe remixing each chapter as a new blog
post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking posts on nzcommons and reusing them
on WrtiersDenHamilton. Remixing them. Great
pratice to edit work. This is going to get
my over the wordcount!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa had taken a small ship from storage and attempt to locate Antonys ship. From her calcalations she has a rough idea where the ship could be
She was able access GPS days from the ships camera before the footage stopped. Vanessa marched up the ramp. She had decided to bring Joey on the
trip with her. Vanessa was impressed with how much of a hand it was once she actived it. Joey could be a help if she locates Antonys ship.
The ship took off with Vanessa on it leaving Mars atmophere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antonys head hurt. The visions of multi time lines were apearing again. He was running low on the substance to opress them. Detecive was still
straped to the chair. His body full of life but his mind in another time. Antony reached for the supply cubbard and pulled out a capsure of the
substance. He needed the injection, the visions were becoming too unbearable. He placed the capsure into a clean needled and injected it into his
arm. The visions imedicatly stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blitz was licking Sarahs blood off the ground on Mars when she was shot in the head by Antony. The causes a glitch in the timelines. When Sarah was
shot in the head it causes Blitz to be warped to another timeline where Joey notices him as he is walking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey and Sarah walked down the dark and gloomy road. They arms were interlocked. In the distance they could see a shape that looked like a cat. The
two headed closer towards the shape. It was unusal for there to be other lifeforms out in public. As they got closer to the figure they knew something
was wrong. The cat had mutated or something. Out the side of it's next were two long human arms. Sarah vomited. The creature skretched and ran off.
'What the hell has happened here,' Sarah asked Joey, spiting the vomit from her mouth. 'I think that man Dectective is changing the events', Joey
said. 'Uganka was spose to let us and we would use the time split device,' he continued to expain. 'I have no idea what we do now, we may be able
to still active the time split device. Just because we didn't activate it then doesn't mean it won't,' Joey paused to let Sarah finish coughing,
'Are you OK?,' he asked, concerned for the coughing fit that Sarah had gotten herself into. The creature had stopped skretching and ran off into
the dark. Joey moved up to where it was standing, licking something on the ground. He debed his finger into the substance. It was a rich red.
Human blood. 'What would human blood be doing here?' Joey wondered. 'This is most unusal', he thought. Sarah had finished her coughing fit.
'What do we have here', She asked Joey. 'It seems to be human blood,' Joey explained, moving a sample of the blood into a container for analize
back at the lab. 'Human blood!', Sarahs jaw dropped. She bend down and had a close look at the puddle on the ground. 'And this cat creature was
drinking this? Why?', Sarah asked. 'I have no idea but there is something crazy happening here', Joey replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blitz siped the blood that had been left on the floor when Antony shot Sarah. She looked around. Everything had changed. She relized that he was no
longer on Mars. From what it looked like - she was on what looked Earth. Blitz had never been to Earth. She had been created in Antonys lab on Mars.
Antony had shown her images of Earth. Blitz was part human and cat felling a strong connection to Earth. Blitz froze when she saw two figure
approch. Who were these people? she thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day22.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 21 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>meeting-2015-12-02</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/meeting-2015-12-02.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi fellow scribes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a big group at the last Writers Den meeting. Welcome to Sachi, Selena and Kaleah. It is fantastic that the Den is gaining in support and reputation as being a breeding ground for emerging writers. A place to hone your skills and hang-out with other cool writers. (if you weren't there, we still missed you!!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time to close the group to new members again, for now.  Time to settle, hunker down and work on the writing craft. I would like to see a return to writing exercises, going back to setting, characterisation, plot etc, especially for the newer members and as a refresher for the long-termers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about craft, the homework challenge was to write dialogue and this created useful discussion, critique and chortling (the latter due largely to the candid humour of Jeff and Terry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike, from the group, has offered to hold Sunday meetings at his place, but this has yet to be finalised (how, when, where, what, who), so there will be an update to come on this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William is also developing our own website, so that will be a fantastic way to keep connected, share information, and let the rest of the cyberworld know creative writing is alive and flourishing in Hamilton, New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ielse has kindly offered to take up the communications side of things, emails and updates etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure there will be a couple of writers who will be confident in co-ordinating and facilitating meetings after the next session on the 2nd of December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also been in contact with Lisa Pritchard, to let her know what is going on, and I am hoping she will be able to come along to one of the meetings to meet everyone and give us a little knee up to put some of our writing on the Hamilton City Library website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEXT MEETING 2ND DECEMBER.
1.  Homework challenge: BELIEVE IT OR NOT. Or in literary terms, 'the suspension of disbelief' (Google the term, if you are unsure). Write about 500 words, making the extraordinary seem believable, a tall tale. For example, giving your boss an excuse why you were 'sick'. You can probably think of a better idea, There is usually a series of complications (and then...and then...and then...). Can you please bring along some copies for shared critique, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release the creativity. Sachi has kindly volunteered to give us a short exercise on creativity. (We look forward to that, Sachi!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeff Taylor (Master of Flash) has offered to give a brief presentation on entering competition, covering how to present your work, what the judges are looking for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in Progress. If you need feedback or input on a particular area of any work in progress, your peers will give you honest and valuable critique to help you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last meeting for the year will be on the 16th of December. (I will be with you in spirit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't wish to continue receiving these emails, let me know and I will take you off the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

'Where am I', he though. Standing over him was a strange looking part-human, part-alien creature. Something had changed. He
knew something was terriblely wrong. Straps were holding his arms and legs. He was unable to move. The lightbulb light flickered. The creature stood
over him with a wicked grin. He seld two skelpes in 2 of his hands. The other two arms holding other equipment. Detective splatted 'hello' from his
mouth. The creature mutted some words at Detective which he understood barely. He gets asked about his most recent breakfast. He sees visions of
eggs on breakfast, watching the broadcast on the television and the protesters outside. Then darkness. His next memories were waking up here with
Antony standing over him, cutting his head open. Antony had injected something into his system. His body felt different, and it wasn't just the
open brain surgery. Antony questioned him, pretending to be nice. Detective lied his way through the questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event that just took place was onboard a ship traveling through unknown space with its engines switched off. It involved two main characters of
the story. Everything is one big cycle. Whatever happens, happens. If you attempt to change it, it will fail.
Detective is sent back to where he
wakes to a world inhabited by humans. The humans find the alien dna in his brain leading to extraction and development of ai systems. It is here
where he begins to experience multipy timelines. At some point there was a hickup with the timelines, causing characters to experience multi
timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two major different timelines. The first - when humans kill Loth'Raks planet, leading to Antony killing human race. The 2nd - when
robots kill the human race, stops the attack on Loth'Raks planet and Loth'Rak ends up destoring his own planet. What ever they attempt to do they
are unable to save Earth. The novel takes place over a long period of time. The characters consiste of generations and robots that live forever.
When Antony sent the first person back with the time slipt device - Detective humans find him and extract the metal out of his brain and duplaict
the metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a ever lasting circle. When will it stop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa had tracked Antonys ship to just outside of Mars atomsphere. From the footage she was watching of the ship it had switched off it's engines
and was drifting through space. She was able to access the CCTV onboard the ship. The achieve of the ships footage was all there. She was able to
view all the ships footage of when Antony had boarded the ship on Mars, taken off, and now floating through space. Vanessa started the footage from
the start, from when Antony board the ship. The camera she was viewing was inside the ship, pointing towards the entry to the ship. Vanessa watched
the footage of the door to the ship opened. Antony stepped into the ship with the body of Detective. She switched cameras - allowing her to see him
dump the body onto a chair and strap it in. Antony rushed quickly to the ships controls - starting the engine up and taking off. Camera footage
showed Antony at the wheel of the ship steering the ship. Once he has left Mars he switches off the ship and gets up off the control seat.
The footage shows him moving towards the body he has on the ship and perform brain surgery on the body - injecting the body with some sort of
substance. Vanessa needed to find out what this was. She continued to watch the footage of the brain surgery taking place, despite being discusted
by the footage. It showed Detectives forehead being cut into, and around the side/back. Antony removes the scalp and using a needle - pokes it into
the brain injected some substance.
Antony sews the scalp back up. The footage shows detectives eyes open when he has completed this. Vanessa studies the footage carefully. 'Does that
make him a zombie?,' she considers. Detective was a dead corpse. Injecting him with this substance gave him life. Maybe he's not the same person he
was when he died? But then again - maybe he will be the same. What happened next was the strangest thing. The footage shows Antony and Detective
chatting. Antony is seen scrampling around the room - organising something. He looks like hes in a rush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day21.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>nanowrimo15-day20</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day20.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antony rushed down the secret entry of the building. As he made his way he could hear a voice booming out the front of the building.
The voice was distorted but it sounded like a females voice. It must be Vanessa, Antony thought to himself. A grin came over his face.
She will have no idea what I'm about to do. He reached the end of the corodoor. To get to the next area he needed to set off the dynomite
that was strapped to the wall. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a lighter. He procided to light the dynomite. Antony took serveral
steps back. The blast exposed a civilians lounge. Three figures were in the room. Two male and one female. The female collabsed in shock. One
of the males got down on his hands and knees and started to worship Antony. The usual treatment he got. The third was on the ground - looking
quite lifeless. Antony stepped forward, towards the man on the floor. With two of his arms Antony picked the man up and headed towards the kitchen.
Once in the kitchen he was able to activate a button that opened up a staircase below. He made his way down. He moved quickly but carefully, holding
the body as he took steps. He reached the bottom of the steps. In front of him lay a ship. Antony pressed the green button and the ramp came down
along with the door sliding open. He made his way up the ramp and into the ship, closing the door after him.  The ship was dim. Antony switched on
the lights and procided towards the crew desk. He dumped the body onto a chair. He needed to take off now. He started the ships engines up. The
protesters and Vanessa would hear him taking off, but it's too late. Using the controller he lifted the ship up off the ground. It hovered for a
moment before being thrust forward. He took off leaving Mars. Looking out the window below he could see the mob group of people watching him
take off from the surface. Antony wasn't sure what to do. He decided to just drift in space for now. Once he was far away from Mars that Vanessa
wouldn't be able to find him, he switched off the ships engines. Antony drifted through empty space. He was not happy with the result. Could he
change any of the events that took place? He did not approve of Vanessa and Joey releasing the footage, he wanted to chage that. Antony had the
time split device. He decided that he would use the person that he captured and send him back to change effects. The body was still lifeless. He
needed to bring it back to life. He lifted the body up from the chair and took it into the medical surgery room. Antony would need to perform open
brain surgery on the person, injecting in some of Antonys dna into the brain. This would interlink the two and create a super human.
He placed the body on the table and reached for the skelpel on the table. He had never performed open brain surgery so Antony was quite nervous.
Antony started to cut into the forehead. Blood squarted out at Antony. He wiped it from his face. 'Perhaps a mask might help', he thought, searching
through the cubard for a surgery mask. There was one. It was a dusty but he wiped it off and placed it on his face. He moved back to the body of the
table. The splatter wouldn't get on his face now, instead on the mask.  Antony continued to cut into forehead around into the side and back. He was
able to pull off the area now and access the brain. He took a needle and injected the brain with his DNA. The substance traveled from the brain and
into the rest of the body. Antony started to sew the brain back together. Just as he finished the sewing the persons eyes opened. Antony jumped back.
'Hi there', the person spoke. Antony was shocked that the substance worked so quickly. 'Hi, Im Antony', he spoke, holding out his hand. The person
held their hand out and shook Antonys hand. 'I'm Detective, nice to meet you', shacking Antonys hand. Clearly Detective was delisional, he had no
idea who Antony was. Open brain surgery might do this to someone. At least he seems to know who he is. Antony continued to question him. 'So what was
the last thing you remember', Antony asked Detective. 'I remember eating breakfast with my Mother and Father. Mother had made me eggs', Detective
explained. 'And what date was this?', Antony questioned. Detecive continued, giving Antony the date that they had left Mars. It seemed like he
couldn't remember the television broadcast. This was good, Antony didn't want Detective remembering the television broadcast and the riots.
Antony started with his lie. 'Detective I have some terrible news for you, Im afraid to say that you and me are the only two remainding lifeforms
left from Mars. Shortly after you had breakfast there was an attack on the Human population, you blacked out', Antony told him. Detective listened
in horror at the story. 'I'm afraid you and me were the only two to escape. As I was evactaling the palace I came accross you and loaded you onto
the ship', Antony finished his story. 'And then you woke up here'. Detective didn't know what to say. They only two remaining lifeforms. 'Do you have
a plan?', Detecitve asked Antony. 'As a matter of fact I do', replied Antony. He had thought for sometime on the plan for Detective. Kidnaping him
when he left Mars had worked out well. 'I am going to send you back in time with this', Antony announced, holding up the time split device to
Detective. Antony held up the time split device. Detective reached out to grab it. 'Careful now', Antony said as he pulled it back from Detectives
grasp. 'This is a dangerous device if used incorrectly'. Detective steered at the device, captavated by it. 'What we need is a plan for when you
go back, I've written you up a list of tasks', Antony explained. He pulled out a list and handed to Antony. 'You want me to killed these people',
Detective asked. 'That is correct', Antony said with a smile. 'If you are sucessful, all this will change, you will be reunited with your family.
Detective nodded. 'Fantastic!', Antony stood up. 'We should get started with the prep straight away'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa had driven Antony from Mars. She wasn't happy though. She felt uneasy that he had a ship and was out in space, free. A monster so
corupt should never be free. Vanessa watched the ship disapear from view. Her first plan was to talk to the family of Detective who was on
the ship with Antony. They had done a head count of all humans on Mars, Detective was the only human missing.
Vanessa stepped into the apartment building. The police had taken Detectives parents and they were being held for questioning on what
happened. Vanessa was at the families apartment building. She wanted to get a sense on what happened here before talking to Detectives Mother
and Father. She walked down the hallway. It lead to the lounge. The lounge was a mess. The whole wall had been burst in. From the looks of
it dinomite was used to destory the wall. Vanessa peaked through the hole. The tunnel looked like it lead to palace. That must of been how he
escaped the palace. Vanessa headed down the passage way and it came out at the palace. She headed back to the apartment. Vanessa walked into the
kitchen. There was a staircase opened in the center of the room. Vanessa followed the steps down. It lead to a ships hanger. This was where Antony
must of kept the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony started to prep Detective for the travel. He used leather straps and straped his arms and legs to the chair. 'Will this hurt', asked Detective
'You won't feel a thing', Antony lied. The fact was the trip could be painful and there were unexpected consquiences. Antony had tested the device
before on himself. He had changed past events before and had experienced visions of multipy worlds. The same consqiences could happen to Decective
when he goes back.
Antony gave Detective an injection. 'Are you ready?', Antony asked. Detective nodded. Antony handed Detective the time split device. Antony had
preprogrammed to take Detective back to a certain moment. 'Just hit the green button when you are ready', Antony told Detective. He pressed down on
the greenbutton. His body frozen in time before he coulf take it off. Antony stood there with his mouth open, he hadn't finished he was just
speaking. The ship frozen in space and the area around the ship froze. Within a few minutes the ship started to move again as did Antony. Detective
stayed frozen, experiencing the past. Antony looked around the ship. To the left and right. 'Had it worked?', he thought to himself. He steered at
Detective. He was still frozen. His body looked like it had life unlike before when Antony had picked Detectives lifeless body off the kitchen
floor. Would his parents relize he was alive? When Antony had grabed him from the lounge floor Detective was dead. The injection he had given the
brain had brought him back to life. Antony thought it was strange that Detective remembered eating eggs but didn't remember the television broadcast.
'Were you lying to me?', Antony asked the frozen body of Detective. Of course there was no responce - only silence. Antony thought about what
Dectective might be doing right now. Whatever he was doing, it was going to change the present. The lightbulb flickered as Antony sat there. Waiting
for Detective to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day20.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
