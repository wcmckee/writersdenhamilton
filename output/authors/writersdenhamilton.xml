The food was sweet fresh cream buns and savery muffins. He scanned the area for an
exit. This was too many people for him to handle. He noticed a door leading to a balconey on the far side of the room. He would have to make
his way through several grouups of people. He took a deep breath and procided to walk towards the door. One step in front of another.
'excuse me', he spoke as he made his way past the group.
He finally reached the door and squeesed through the part opening.
Outside on the balconey he felt better. The room felt crowded but out here there was room. The sun was shinning and Joey was able to find a seat
and started to eat his cream bun.
techfuncmasters was the company hosting the conference. It was a three day event where business and technqiue people from a range of companies
got together and shared and collabrated on ideas. The name of the conference was api days.
Joey was a contracter and had just started a new project of developing some addons for gimp. The addons that he had to build was to make it
posible to give the computer a collection of digital paintings, and the video process of the paintings - and a blank canvas. The computer
would then mimic the original painting - creating a new painting with help from a new reference image. Joey wasn't sure who he was creating
this software for - but it didn't really matter. The main thing for joey was that he was getting paid well - and that the addons would be
open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey heard steps behind him. He was no longer alone out there. A woman in her 20s approched and sat near him. She too had came outside to eat
the morning tea. Joey checked her name tag. Vanessa May, TechFuncMasters, Developer, it read.
'Hi there', spoke Joey after he finished the mouthful of cream bun.
'Hi, How are are', Vanessa replied. 'I'm great, enjoying the conference, some great keynotes. I'm Joey'. Joey shock Vanessas hand.
'Vanessa', she replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony watched as Joey and Vanessa meet. It was as predicted. History had told that these two would meet this day. October 14th 2065 at
10:50am. Antony knew his job was done and started to walk out of the building. The place was crowded as he started to push his way to the
exit.
'sir, wait', he heard a voice behind him. He ignored it. It was important that he got out of the building in the next 5 minutes. He kept
moving, at a faster pace. 'STOP', the voice yelled. Antony started to run. The last thing he remembers is a buzzing sound. Then darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'So where do you work', Vanessa asked Joey. His badge read Joey McFurson. The company line was blank. His role was set to Developer.
'Oh i am doing some contract work currently. Mostly image maniplation kind of stuff', Joey replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light flickered as Antony opened his eyes. He was strapped to a chair. His mouth gagged to stop him from yelling. The room was small.
A table was in front of him along with a similar chair. On the table was a bunch of medical and electrical devices.
'What the hell', he thought to himself. He heard a door open. In walked a solid built man in his 40s. He had long black hair, brown eyes,
and walked with a slight limp. The man sat down in front of Antony. 'I am Detective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day3.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>nanowrimo15-day2</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day2.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah heard the jug boiling from behind the door. She had just showered, rinsing the blood from her body. Antony had given her some clothes
that belonged to his exwife. Antonys wife had been in a terrible accident and passed away. Antony had never remarried but instead focused on
his work. Shortly after his wifes death he was hired to develop software to develop code for to get the computer to paint lines. Antony was
a specialist in writing code for graphics. Antony never meet the man who contracted him. All the code was uploaded to a server. He was given
a private key to connect to. When the code was uploaded to the server it is moved off the server and original content deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony opened the pantery cabnet. He was hungry but wasn't quite sure what to make. Noodles seemed like a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah opened the steel door and steped into the room. Antony was standing in front of the cubard. He seemed to be deciding on something
to cook. 'Take a seat', he spoke. 'Thank you', Sarah replied, moving towards the table and chairs. 'You must be starving, is there anything
in partical you feel like?', asked Antony. 'Yes I am hungry, whatever is fine', Sarah replied. 'Fried noodles it is then', Antony reached
for the Japanese style noodles. 'Cut two onion', he spoke. A metal mechanical arm with a knife attached to the end on the bench started to
cut up two onions. 'auto fried noodles'. 'fried noodles started', replied the machine. Antony moved towards the table where Sarah was sitting.
'I will let the machine take care of dinner so we can talk', Antony remarked as he took a seat oposite Sarah. 'I will like you to explain
all events you can remember from the past twenty four hours', Antony asked Sarah. He took out a pad and pen.
'Where to begin', Sarah replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah looked back at the Earth from the capsule. She was being sent to the moon on a mission to recover prototype 6b345 ArtContol. System
control had lost contact with it during a recent mission. It had been with 5 other prototype ArtControl machines exploring craters of the moon
before its radiosignal failed. It was suspected that its system had been taken over by a hacker and it was being remotely controled by someone
on Earth. This was dangerous as this particle machine was designed with nuclear capabilities.
Sarah closes her eyes as she exited the Earth atmospher. The ship she was traveling over was running the AI ArtControl system headless. This
allowed for ArtControl to control the ships functions so that the crew were able to relax. This cut down the risk of mistakes as ArtControl
was designed to not make a mistake.
Once on the moon Sarah would carry a Raspberry Pi computer hooked to her life support that would assist her on the mission to retreve prototype
6b345. The Pi was running the AI Artcontrol.
Sarah stepped out of the pod. The her suit had been modified to allow her to walk on the moon with similar gravitiy to that of Earth.
20 meters in front of her she spotted the moon bugey. This was going to be used to get to the crater where system control last had contact
with 6b345. The bugey was equiped with GPS that would be controled by ArtControl to take her to the crater.
She started moving towards the bugy. 'Sarah, this is system control', came a voice on her headset. 'confium, This is Sarah', she replied.
'We notice you have arrived and exited the pod, status update' the voice asked. 'Everything is fine, moving toward the transport'.
'Roger that, ArtControl will take over once you reach the transport, system control out'. The transmission ended.
Sarah continued moving towards the transport. After finally reaching the transport she climbed into the seat. It was a single pod that had
been designed to move over the toughest condidtions - perfect for the rocky texture of the moon.
Sarah reached for the Raspberry Pi from her belt and conected it to the transport.
The Pi switched on with the power given to it from the transport. The monitor in front of Sarah switched on. Bios loaded, and the kernal
booted. Once the operating system was loaded the transport began moving forward. Sarah straped herself in as it began to speed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a distance the prototype 6b345 ArtControl watched the transport zip accross the moons surface. 6b345 stood still, knowing the humans
would not be able to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3km till destanation the monitor display. Estamited time of arrive: 45 seconds. Sarah could see the crater now that they gotten closer.
The transport started to slow down. It stopped just before reaching the crater. Destanation reached the monitor displayed. Sarah unbucked
her belt and climbed out of the transport. She moved into the crater. The place was a mess. Scraps of metal were lying around. She reached for
the camera in her belt and started to document the evidence. Something had happened her and it was her job to figure it out.
She moved deeper into the crater. What is this metal? She thought to herself, it was nothing like they had on Earth. It must of been some
sort of alien technology. Sarah bent over and gathered some of the metal depree into a evidence bag. Scientists back on Earth will analize
this. It may shreed some light on what happend to 6b345.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6b345 watched as the human gathered evidence from the site. It had activated its camo that rendered it invisible to the human eye.
It watched as the human placed an object into a bag. 'Sarah, this is system control', a voice blasted. 'We are getting some crazy
radio signals from your position, status update please'. The human lifted her arm towards her ear. 'Sarah', 6b345 thought to itself.
It loaded its database of human personal. 'Sarah Clarkson, 27 years old, American', The database showed. 'More detail', 6b345 loaded
more detailed information. 'Born New York December 15th 2021 at 5:32am to Danny and Mary Clarkson. Attended New York State School from
ages 5 till 17, studied computer science in New York University for 4 years. Currently working for NASA as a AI developer.'
6b345 shutdown the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sharp bass noice blasted in Sarahs ear. 'System Control, was that you', asked Sarah over her mic. 'Sarah, This is mission control.
We did not transmit, is there a problem?', replied system control. 'hmm strange, it was a bass sound happening in my headset', Sarah
remarked. "I'm done here, heading back to the pod". Sarah turned around and headed towards the transport. She needed to head back to
the pod and return to Earth with the evidence she had gathered. She reached the transport that would return her to the pod.
The process was the same as before - she took the Raspberry Pi from her belt and attached it to the transport. The monitor booted up
and transport turned around - heading towards the pods location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6b345 held on to the transport as it started to move towards the pod. They were planning on traveling on the ship with Sarah. The camo
was running out of power though so it may need to hide in the pod during the return trip to Earth. This could cause issues if Sarah notived
him onboard. There was enough power to get on the pod and take off, which is the important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah pulled up at the pod. She disattached the Raspberry Pi from the transport and unstapped herself. She was still getting a stange
bass sound from her headset. She moved towards the pod and took off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she was exiting the moon there was a large explosion. She looked down in horror to see that the moon had split, creating several
parts of the moon. The parts were attached only just, but this couldn't be good for Earth. The effects this would have on Earth would
be devestating. Maybe she wouldn't be ableto return to Earth. Mars was an option - Humans had set up a base on the planet incase
something ever happened. It was mainly run by ArtControl machines but several hundrad humans were preserved there as a backup for
humankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6b345 had curled into a small cube to fit inside the pod. They had made their way into the supply and invitory area where hopefully
they wouldn't be noticed. To preserve power they switched off the camo and would switch it on if someone enteredd the area or once
they landed back on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>science fiction</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/nanowrimo15-day2.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2015 11:01:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>day1</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/day1.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;this is a great script editer! I am testing this.
Hello from the otherside!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my novel for November 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock had struck midnight. The single light bulb flickered. His fingers clicked the keys. Eyes moving back and forward on the screen. Private
returned an error. There was no way he believed this was happening. The private key was broken and meant he wasa unable to connect to the server.
Something had happened and the key had became corrupted. Perhaps he needed a break. When crap like this happened the best option was to walk away.
He stood up from this chair. Taking a long sigh he walked towards the door. The muscles on his thighs stang. The long was he had taken eariler that day
had taken a toll on his body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He switched the jug on. Tapping his feet. 'I need some music he thought'. Reaching in his pocket he pulled out his Samsung cellphone. It was running
a modified version of Debian. Unlocking the phone he tapped the music icon. A list of stations appeared. 'oh the choices', he spoke. 'Who are you talking
to hun', a voice came from another room. A woman walked into the room. 'Oh Hi Babe', he spoke. I didn't hear you return - 'how was work?'.
Sarah stepped out of her office. The rain poured. 'Joey are you coming?', she yelled over her shoulder. ' one moment, just cleaning up', Joey replied.
Joey scrambled down the stairs to catch up with Sarah. She was holding the door open for him. ' Sorry about that, needed to finish off corrupting
that private key', he told Sarah. 'Did it work?', she replied as they both stepped into the rain. Joey nodded as they began walking down the street
together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sky was turning black as they continued to walk down the road together, arms locked together. The streets were deserted. Old cars were burning on
the street. Sirens scretched in the distance.do you thin thy are coming for us, joey asked sarah. ' There are bigger problems for the police to
deal with than us', sarah replied. careful, watch your step, she added. A burning bumper from a vehile lay on the path. The two carefully steped over.
Not much further to go, joey said. 'It's just around this corner'. The two walked around the corner and turned into a narrow alleyway. They walked
past several abanded building before reaching a door which read: number 6 techfuncmasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'This is it', Sarah wispered. She raised her hand and gave two solid knocked on the door. They heard movement inside as someone moved towards the door.
'whos there', a voice spoke. 'Sarah and Joey Macfurson', spoke sarah. The door crecked open. A man in his mid 40 stood.in front of them. He was
tall - 6 foot 5 with a long brown beard and blue eyes. His head was saved. He wore circal glasses. ' i am Uganka ', he spoke in a eastern european
accent. He held his hand out and shook both Joeys, followed by Sarahs hands. 'it is nice to meet you finally ', Joey said as he shook Uganka's
hand with a strong grip. 'Please come in out of this rain', Uganka greeted them into the building. The two stepped into the door. 'Please follow me',
Uganka spoke as he started to was down the hall way. Saray and Joey followed the man, arms still linked together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They reached the end of the hall and stopped at a steel door. Uganka stopped. ' Is something wrong? ', Sarah asked. 'This is your last chance to leave',
spoke. Uganka. 'ther is no turning back from here'. 'no we wnt to do this', both Joey and Sarah spoke. 'very well', uganka spoke as he unlocked the
steel door. They walked into a room that was pitch black. Sarah grabbed Joeys arm in fear. Ã­ts ok, joey wispered.  The steel door behind them slammed
shut and they both jumped. Purple and red lazers starting wizzing around. 'Where is Uganka', asked Joey. The man that had lead them into the room
was gone. A wizzing noice started. Growing louder, andd louder. Sarah and Joey let go of each other and held their hands to their ears. Along with
the wizzing sound increasing a new sound began - sirens. The two dropped to the ground. Sarah was the first to screem and started moving in a
circle motionon the ground. Joey started screaming shortly afterwards.  The sound was deafening. Suddently the room flashed with lightning as the noise
stoppeed. The room returned to norma lighting, but the room was empty. Both Sarah and Joey had vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light flicked as Antoney lay back on his comoputer chair. On his left monitor he has the latest epoise of the telvison show 'Linus'. On his
central monitor had a web browser open with a IPython Notebook running. The right monitor had test resultsbeing displays. Three terminal windows,
all displaying results of his code changes. CCTV monitors hovered above these three monitors. This kept an eye on other rooms in the building along with
outside and views from the street. He had tapped into the cities traffic cameras and was getting a realtime feed of the surounding street. Should
any trouble head his way - he would know and be able to make a quick exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alert: inruder in section 31 spoke a voice. Antoney glanced away from the television show to the cctv monitors. 'switch to room 18', he spoke.
Thee monitor zoomed in on a camera in room 18. 'hmm, that stange', antoney thought to himself. The room looked normal. 'Maybe Ineed to check it out
myself', he rose from his chair and started walking towards the steel door. He unlocked it and walked in. The room was pitch black. 'somethings
wrong', he spoke. 'This. can't be happening'. Lights switched on and everything was normal. 'So strange', he spoke.
Antoney caucioly walked through the room heading toward room 18. He peaked around the hallway corner. Empty. He started walking down the hallway.
Suddenly he heard a womans screem and frooze. 'Who the hell is there', he yelled. Now he knew there was an inruder. He reached for his handgun
in his pouch. He was armed and ready. i have a gun', he warneddd. the intruder as he contined walking towards the screem. He reached the door. The
letters 18 read on it. im going to enter, he warned. Gun drawn he busted the door open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman lay in the center of the floor. She was naked and covered in blood. 'Who are you, and how did you get in here', Antony asked the woman. He
lowered his weapon and creeped lcloser to the woman. At thihs point he had relised she was no harm. Her screaming stopped as she noticedd him.
'i am sarah', she spook. She leapt from the ground and wrapped her body around Anttony. He was a little shocked to have this woman suddenly
over him. In his arms she sobs. 'now,  now, he spoke, pating him on the back. he gently pushed her off him, moving her to an office seat.
'lets find you a blanket', he said. He spots a rugs that he wraps around you.
'How did you get here', Antony asks Sarah. Still shacking she repied with, 'The last thing I remember is purple and red lights'.
'hmm, interesting', spoke Antony. 'What is todays date?', asks Antony. 'The date..', Sarah pauses. 'It is November 21st 2065'.
Antonys draw drops. 'You believe the year is 2065?'. Sarah gives him a confused look. 'Sarah, it's the year 3532'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antony switched on the jug and started making him himself a coffee. As he poured the water a voice apeared from behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joey typed on the keyboard. S.T.A.R.T.S.Y.S.E.M. Return. The machines main led light switched to green. A wirling sound begins as the machine
starts up. Joey fixes his glasses as he nervously waits to see if the boot happens. He had tested it and all the tests had passed. The bios
had finished loading and the machine was booting the kernal. This was the most progress the machine had done. Scientists had worked for years
to develop this machine. The room was airgapped and blocked all radio signals. This was to stop interference from any outside source. Crackers
had attempted to modify the machine so it was imported that it was kept secure. The building it was stored in was on the 10th floor of the building,
inside another building. Large fenced surrounded each of the builds with turrets to shoot anything that moved.
It was not posible for anyone to reach the machine. Even the machine that Joey was controling wasn't the real machine but was instead sending off
signals to the real machine. This meant if the fake machine was comporomised then the true machine would still be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The handed on the clock ticked over to three thiry two. LED lights on the panel displayed the year November 21st 2065. Twenty percent of the time
the machine got the time collabration correct but from time to time an error accured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linus stood in front of the crowd. A grin on his face and a laptop under his arm. The television show 'Linus' had just won awards for the best
Drama and Linus had won an award for best actor. He didn't feel much like an actor. He waved as the crowd cheered. Cameras flashed. Linus bowed
and posed for the camera. One of his security personal whispered into his ear, 'sir we need to move'. Linus nodded and waved to his fans before
entering the steel door. The room inside the steel door was bright. Monitors filled the desks. Wirling sounds rose from the computers. The machine
began to speak. 'Command Speak'.
Joey steared in amazment. It was miminicing his commands. 'open gimp', he spoke. 'Opening gimp', the machine replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ItWillBeMine steered at her computer her eyes flicking left to write. Reading the text on the screen. 'I"M GOING TO COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND MURDER
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY', the message wrote. 'Another death threat', she sighed to herself. She had been getting these increasingly since she became
a mod of RedditGetsDrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had a boring job. Sitting at a desk all day and ringing clients to try to sell them antivirus software. She knew herself that the software
was spyware. Clients installing the software on their machines meant that the company was able to use the machine to look at all their data.
It was closed source so no one was able to know what the software really did. It didn't protect people it harmed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She partically liked to ban developers that attempted to produce artwork. If she a office telemarketer wasnt able to draw she didnt want to
let developers draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArtControl had started painting people on RedditGetsDrawn long before ItWillBeMine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did ItWillBeMine take over the subreddit? What could be done instead. Allow all artists. There is no such thing as troll artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArtControl had been partically annoying for her. They had developed a script to create a new account for every piece of artwork they created
- submitted. They did alot of artwork - sometimes up to 30 pieces a day. That is up to 30 accounts her and other mods needed to find everyday
and ban. The script caused the artwork to be sent via message to the original poster, along a with mod mail. The art was uploaded to several
different places - but all redirect to artcontrol. This meant when they tried to ban a certain domain the artwork had been uploaded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArtControl developed the machine to create and submit artwork to RedditGetsDrawn. They had grown tired of painting everyday but still wanted
to create art for the people of RedditGetsDrawn. The machine would look at all the reference images uploaded to GetDrawn via the api. It then
choice the best reference to draw. The machine painted the same way as ArtControl painted - it started the a white landscape document and
added a line layer, followed by grayscale and finally colour. The AI of the machine was able to match up the reference with the history of
ArtControls paintings, creating a unique pience of artwork in the same style as ArtControl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a hot summer day on in Florida. St Andrews High School had just finished morning tea and the students were taking their streets.
Sirens approched the school. Swat team burst into classroom 14. 'Get on the ground', yelled an officer. The students and tutor scremed
and dropped to the ground. 'Which one is Vanessa May?', an officer asked the teacher. 9 officers cicled the students. They didn't seem
interested in the teacher. 'I am Vanessa', a quiet voice raised from the back. Offices moved to the back. Four officers stood over the
girl, who was trembling. 'Vanessa, you are under arrest', the lead officer said as another officer culfed the girl. 'Anything you say
may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attnery, if you cant afford one then one will be apointed for you,'
Do you understand', the lead officer told her. Vanessa nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The officers escorted Vanessa out of the school building. The class stared at her as she exited the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Class is dismissed', announced the computer. 'Be sure to have the reports ready for the next class on ArtControl: The Machine of Art'.
The robatic student stood up imediatly and walked out of the room in single file. 'Confiumed Master. Goodbye', the students spoke as they
exited the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where you are going there are no roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ItWillBeMine was at home when she heard her private number ring. She had just banned 5 accounts of ArtControl. They had hired a programmer
to write a script that searched for art submissions that used ArtContols common colour. They wanted to match his style but it was becoming
difficut. She really wanted to find the machine that he was using to create these paintings. If she could get her hands on the machine
she will be able to stop him from posting once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had been posting on RedditGetsDrawn for over 30 years. He was famous and loved on the subreddit except for her. She considered his
work troll art. Artcontrol had devoited his life to creating software and hardware to create artwork. They started small - creating
small scripts to building a fully automated machine that would mimic his painting style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ItWillBeMine slowly climbed out of her seat. She had grown fat over the years from a poor diet and spending too much time sitting down.
She never walked, and rarely went outside. Her exhusband would pick her up for work daily. Her husband - Micheal grown tired of her
laziness and bad attatute and left her for another woman. He was much happier, but still saw her during the week when she picked
her up for work and dropped her off at home afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They split custoly of their daughter - she would 7 days at her monthers, followed by 7 days at her fathers. At the start of the sepration
Micheal got the majority of the time. She only spent every second weekend at her Mothers as the court decided she was unfit for a split
cusoley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ItWillBeMine picked the phone up before the final ring. It had been setup to disconet the call if the phone was answered at the wrong
time. 'Hello', she spoke into the speaker. 'ItWillBeMine', a males voice replied. 'Yes, Who is this?', asked ItWillBeMine.
'This is dective Hans Lonery, I'm afaird to enforme you that we have your daughter. We need you to come down to the station'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art hold secret symbolism for a secret cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artwork produced by the Machine was in being used to encrupt documents from the goverment. It allowed private keys to be created out
of artwork. The holder of public keys were able to recreate the artwork with their own ArtControl machine that was a copy of the original.
The hashes were matched to make sure none&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have something change, one mistake changes the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArtControls light switched from red to green as it started to power up. It loaded the bios from the memory card. In its old system the bios
caused a mafanction which meant the kernal failed to load. The new bios had been original developed by Joey and Sarah. The system was open
source and has recieved contrubitions from thousands of people.
The system was originally developed to create artwork in the style of an artist. After the artist passed away they named the system after him.
The machine still creates artwork in the style of the artist but its system had been developed much further to do other tasks.
They were being created and trained in schools to in order to create a better future today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans had started using ArtControl machines in space in order to explore areas that were too dangerous for humans. They were equipted with a
camera that took high res images - 160000 by 8000 pixels. The machines were able to paint scenes that could not be photographed.
NASA had order 1.3 million units that were to be sent to different areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>NaNoWriMo</category><category>novel</category><category>november</category><category>write</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/day1.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2015 23:35:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>prenano</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/prenano.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tonight i am testing my tablet with some writing.

One problem I have with it is that I have been unable to download.
I just ssaved it incase I lose my work. That is not going to happen is it?
This november there is going to be a worldwide writing challange - nanowrite. It involves writing 50,000 words in a month.
2014 was the first year that I attempted the challange. I managed 8,000 works or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas for the book this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autobio - write about my life so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RedditGetsDrawn - write about redditgets drawn. A day in the life of it will be mine.
ppo queem of peace always does it berrerc :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Letter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linus mouth dropped. The patch that he had applied had broken namespace.
He threw his monitor to the ground in anger and stormed out the room.
'Zombies steps', Linus spoke as he demostrated his walking desk. To his left was an old desk.
Harddrives and wires skattted the desk. 'That's my old desk' - he pointed towards the desk.
'The walking desk is better for my back'. He steared at a sleak 23 inch monitor as he moved his legs.
Typing he replied to an email.   Matthew has forked the kernal. To add BSD style securename.
Linus welcomed the idea. He only care about two things. Technology and the kernal.
Cheers erupted from the crowd. Fingers twitched as people updated their social media networks with the news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camera man switched the stream to a portrait of Linus. A smug grin covered his face. The claps from the crowd quietened.
The hashtag imwithlinus started on the networks. BroBeur had already picked up on the tag and switched
the script to start tweeting about it. It sent a tweet every 160 seconds of a subreddit that is
found by searching from a list of subreddits. A random subreddit is picked each time.
The operating system saves the subreddit post title as a filename plus html file.
Nikola  is used to build the site. The files are moved from the post folder into output. Files are uneffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bluetooth device had used all its power up and he needed to switch to an onscreen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>computer</category><category>linus</category><category>write</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/prenano.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2015 09:33:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>creativecommons</title><link>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/creativecommons.html</link><dc:creator>writersdenhamilton</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Mckee is an artist, programmer, early childhood educater, and writer. His artsite is artcontrol.me and is available under a
Creative Commons BY 4.0 licence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During highschool William spend the majority of his time in the Design creating designs in Freehand, after finishing he attended UCOL in
Palmerston North. Here he became seriously interested in drawing and gained confidence - many thanks to his drawing tutor Mark Dustin. He worked
mostly in a a4 visual diary which became a habbit and still carries a sketchbook whereever he goes with him now.
During his time at Palmerston North School of Design he registed the domain artcontrol.me and creating the site&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;artcontrol.me: The Art Of William Mckee.
Was created in 2010 as a site to host his artwork. Previously he had used DeviantArt and Wordpress.com blogs to host his artwork.
The site was originally hosted by GoDaddy the operating system CentOS, and powered by Wordpress. Originally it was licenced under  CC NCBY
but William later decided that the NC licence was wrong and switched to CC BY. He later swtiched from WordPress to Nikola - a Python static
site generater. He later also switched hosting to DigitalOcean with the operating system Debian.
The majority of his machines are running Debian. Fedora is on a couple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first he choose to licence this under a creative commons nc by licence. Later making the decision for cc by removing the nc licence.
He has many problems with the nc licence and would never use it again and don't see many reasons for people to use it.
He has a problem with education, govt, and publicly funded works to be under nc. The good thing the majority of govt seems to be under cc by.
Certain schools in the county have a nc licence which is troubling - especially when all schools have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010 he moved to Wellington and attended The Learning Connexion.
It was here that he focused on life drawing which he was only dabbed with in the past.
GIMP was used for all the digital paintings created. He painted on a windows desktop and laptop.
Later he switched to Fedora and Debian. He painted rarely but enjoys painting with the Raspberry Pi computer and
Many of his works from 2012-2014 of portrait and figures were drawn from references on RedditGetsDrawn.
He would draw portraits of people and give them the drawing - taking a photo for his own reference.
At the bottom of the page he would signit with wcmckee artcontrol.me and write cc by on the piece of original artwork.
These were mostly completely in pencil and coloured pencil.
William is passionate about working with children. In 2014 he volunteered at Whaihanga Early Learning Centre.
His Mother - Linda worked there as the head teacher. His favourite activities were the art area and build structures with wooden blocks.
He would work collaboratively with kids often on the same piece of art. Oil pastel, pencil, and coloured pencil were the most commons media
choices. He was very influenced by the children's drawings - often redrawing elements of their works. A hope was the children learn that art
was about sharing and remixing - something Creative Commons has at its core. William took the liberty and licenced these works under a cc by
licence - photographing and uploaded the works to artcontrol.me. He would create large chalk murals on the ground outside.
Hulk, Spiderman, Bane, and Batman were common requests of characters to draw from the children. These mural pieces were created on the fenceline
of Whaihanga and Knighten Normal School.
Swarms of school children would crowd the fenceline - watching and discussing the artwork with him.
They were often blown away from how quickly he worked. Some of the collab works were developed further with digital painting. He volunteered at Fairfield Community Centre where he drew with children aged 5 to 12.
Felt tip pen was the main media here and he applied much the same techniques with collaboration as at Whaihanga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2012 to 2014 william would draw and paint people from  the Reddit subreddit RedditGetsDrawn. Some days he drew up to thirty people. He
recived many positive comments from people thanking them for their artwork.
Sadly in 2014 William was banned from submitting artwork to the subreddit - being accused from the mods that his artwork is troll artwork.
His website features in in the RGD as exams of troll artwork.
William created the website GetsDrawn.com that scrapes RedditGetsDrawn for reference images as a response for this. This has enabled him to have
an offline version of all the reference images on RedditGetsDrawn.
When asked for a unban he gets laughed at by the mods.
The mods are a bunch of SJW woman who are talentless - in partical ItWillBeMine.
William still draws people on RedditGetsDrawn and sends them artwork but doesn't submit it publicly as it is always deleted by the mods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>artist</category><category>copyright</category><category>creativecommons</category><category>it</category><guid>http://writersdenhamilton.org.nz/posts/creativecommons.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2015 03:18:26 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
